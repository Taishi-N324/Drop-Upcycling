Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872 – 8 June 1913) was an English suffragette who fought for votes for women in Britain in the early twentieth century. A member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on nine occasions, went on hunger strike seven times and was force-fed on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by King George V's horse Anmer at the 1913 Derby when she walked onto the track during the race.
 
Davison grew up in a middle-class family, and studied at Royal Holloway College, London, and St Hugh's College, Oxford, before taking jobs as a teacher and governess. She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches. She soon became known in the organisation for her militant action; her tactics included breaking windows, throwing stones, setting fire to postboxes, planting bombs and, on three occasions, hiding overnight in the Palace of Westminster—including on the night of the 1911 census. Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the WSPU. A procession of 5,000 suffragettes and their supporters accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in Morpeth, Northumberland.

Davison was a staunch feminist and passionate Christian, and considered that socialism was a moral and political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to do at the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse.

Biography

Early life and education

Emily Wilding Davison was born at Roxburgh House, Greenwich, in south-east London on 11 October 1872. Her parents were Charles Davison, a retired merchant, and Margaret  Caisley, both of Morpeth, Northumberland. At the time of his marriage to Margaret in 1868, Charles was 45 and Margaret was 19. Emily was the third of four children born to the couple; her younger sister died of diphtheria in 1880 at the age of six. The marriage to Margaret was Charles's second; his first marriage produced nine children before the death of his wife in 1866.
 
The family moved to Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, while Davison was still a baby; until the age of 11 she was educated at home. When her parents moved the family back to London she went to a day school, then spent a year studying in Dunkirk, France. When she was 13 she attended Kensington High School and later won a bursary to Royal Holloway College in 1891 to study literature. Her father died in early 1893 and she was forced to end her studies because her mother could not afford the fees of £20 a term.
 
On leaving Holloway, Davison became a live-in governess, and continued studying in the evenings. She saved enough money to enrol at St Hugh's College, Oxford, for one term to sit her finals; she achieved first-class honours in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women. She worked briefly at a church school in Edgbaston between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a private school in Worthing, where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to a family in Northamptonshire. In 1902 she began reading for a degree at the University of London; she graduated with third-class honours in 1908.

Activism

Davison joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in November 1906. Formed in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst, the WSPU brought together those who thought that militant, confrontational tactics were needed to achieve their ultimate goal of women's suffrage. Davison joined in the WSPU's campaigning and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches. In 1908 or 1909 she left her job teaching and dedicated herself full-time to the union. She began taking increasingly confrontational actions, which prompted Sylvia Pankhurst—the daughter of Emmeline and a full-time member of the WSPU—to describe her as "one of the most daring and reckless of the militants". In March 1909 she was arrested for the first time; she had been part of a deputation of 21 women who marched from Caxton Hall to see the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, the march ended in a fracas with police and she was arrested for "assaulting the police in the execution of their duty". She was sentenced to a month in prison. After her release she wrote to Votes for Women, the WSPU's newspaper, saying that "Through my humble work in this noblest of all causes I have come into a fullness of job and an interest in living which I never before experienced".
 

In July 1909 Davison was arrested with fellow suffragettes Mary Leigh and Alice Paul for interrupting a public meeting from which women were barred, held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George; she was sentenced to two months for obstruction. She went on hunger strike and was released after five and a half days, during which time she lost ; she stated that she "felt very weak" as a result. She was arrested again in September the same year for throwing stones to break windows at a political meeting; the assembly, which was to protest at the 1909 budget, was only open to men. She was sent to Strangeways prison for two months. She again went on hunger strike and was released after two and a half days. She subsequently wrote to The Manchester Guardian to justify her action of throwing stones as one "which was meant as a warning to the general public of the personal risk they run in future if they go to Cabinet Ministers' meetings anywhere". She went on to write that this was justified because of the "unconstitutional action of Cabinet Ministers in addressing 'public meetings' from which a large section of the public is excluded".
 
Davison was arrested again in early October 1909, while preparing to throw a stone at the cabinet minister Sir Walter Runciman; she acted in the mistaken belief the car in which he travelled contained Lloyd George. A suffragette colleague—Constance Lytton—threw hers first, before the police managed to intervene. Davison was charged with attempted assault, but released; Lytton was imprisoned for a month. Davison used her court appearances to give speeches; excerpts and quotes from these were published in the newspapers. Two weeks later she threw stones at Runciman at a political meeting in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester; she was arrested and sentenced to a week's hard labour. She again went on hunger strike, but the government had authorised the use of force-feeding on prisoners. The historian Gay Gullickson describes the tactic as "extremely painful, psychologically harrowing, and raised the possibility of dying in jail from medical error or official misjudgment". Davison said that the experience "will haunt me with its horror all my life, and is almost indescribable. ... The torture was barbaric". Following the first episode of forced feeding, and to prevent a repeat of the experience, Davison barricaded herself in her cell using her bed and a stool and refused to allow the prison authorities to enter. They broke one of the window panes to the cell and turned a fire hose on her for 15 minutes, while attempting to force the door open. By the time the door was opened, the cell was six inches deep in water. She was taken to the prison hospital where she was warmed with hot water bottles. She was force-fed shortly afterwards and released after eight days. Davison's treatment prompted the Labour Party MP Keir Hardie to ask a question in the House of Commons about the "assault committed on a woman prisoner in Strangeways"; Davison sued the prison authorities for the use of the hose and, in January 1910, she was awarded 40 shillings in damages.
 
In April 1910 Davison decided to gain entry to the floor of the House of Commons to ask Asquith about the vote for women. She entered the Palace of Westminster with other members of the public and made her way into the heating system, where she hid overnight. On a trip from her hiding place to find water, she was arrested by a policeman, but not prosecuted. The same month she became an employee of the WSPU and began to write for Votes for Women.
 
A bipartisan group of MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a Conciliation Bill that would have brought the vote to a million women, so long as they owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.
 
On the night of the 1911 census, 2 April, Davison hid in a cupboard in St Mary Undercroft, the chapel of the Palace of Westminster. She remained hidden overnight to avoid being entered onto the census; the attempt was part of a wider suffragette action to avoid being listed by the state. She was found by a cleaner, who reported her presence; Davison was arrested but not charged. The Clerk of Works at the House of Commons completed a census form to include Davison in the returns. She was included in the census twice, as her landlady also included her as being present at her lodgings. Davison had continually written letters to the press to put forward the WSPU position in a non-violent manner—she had 12 published in The Manchester Guardian between 1909 and 1911—and she undertook a campaign between 1911 and 1913 during which she wrote nearly 200 letters to over 50 newspapers. Several of her letters were published, including about 26 in The Sunday Times between September 1910 and 1912.
 

Davison developed the new tactic of setting fire to postboxes in December 1911. She was arrested for arson on the postbox outside parliament and admitted to setting fire to two others. Sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison, she did not go on hunger strike at first, but the authorities required that she be force-fed between 29 February and 7 March 1912 because they considered her health and appetite to be in decline. In June she and other suffragette inmates barricaded themselves in their cells and went on hunger strike; the authorities broke down the cell doors and force-fed the strikers. Following the force-feeding, Davison decided on what she described as a "desperate protest ... made to put a stop to the hideous torture, which was now our lot" and jumped from one of the interior balconies of the prison. She later wrote:
 
... as soon as I got out I climbed on to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a distance of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, on to the iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, as it was a clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught on the edge of the netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.
 
She cracked two vertebrae and badly injured her head. Shortly afterwards, and despite her injuries, she was again force-fed before being released ten days early. She wrote to The Pall Mall Gazette to explain why she "attempted to commit suicide":
 
I did it deliberately and with all my power, because I felt that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face! If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.
 
As a result of her action Davison suffered discomfort for the rest of her life. Her arson of postboxes was not authorised by the WSPU leadership and this, together with her other actions, led to her falling out of favour with the organisation; Sylvia Pankhurst later wrote that the WSPU leadership wanted "to discourage ... [Davison] in such tendencies ... She was condemned and ostracized as a self-willed person who persisted in acting upon her own initiative without waiting for official instructions." A statement Davison wrote on her release from prison for The Suffragette—the second official newspaper of the WSPU—was published by the union after her death.
 
In November 1912 Davison was arrested for a final time, for attacking a Baptist minister with a horsewhip or dogwhip, while on a stationary train in Aberdeen railway station; she had mistaken the man for Lloyd George. She was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment and released early following a four-day hunger strike. It was the seventh time she had been on hunger strike, and the forty-ninth time she had been force-fed.

Fatal injury at the Derby

On 4 June 1913 Davison obtained two flags bearing the suffragette colours of purple, white and green from the WSPU offices; she then travelled by train to Epsom, Surrey, to attend the Derby. She positioned herself in the infield at Tattenham Corner, the final bend before the home straight. At this point in the race, with some of the horses having passed her, she ducked under the guard rail and ran onto the course; she may have held in her hands one of the suffragette flags. She reached up to the reins of Anmer—King George V's horse, ridden by Herbert Jones—and was hit by the animal, which would have been travelling at around  per hour, four seconds after stepping onto the course. Anmer fell in the collision and partly rolled over his jockey, who had his foot momentarily caught in the stirrup. Davison was knocked to the ground unconscious; some reports say she was kicked in the head by Anmer, but the surgeon who operated on Davison stated that "I could find no trace of her having been kicked by a horse". The event was captured by three newsreel cameras.
 

Bystanders rushed onto the track and attempted to aid Davison and Jones until both were taken to the nearby Epsom Cottage Hospital. Davison was operated on two days later, but she never regained consciousness; while in hospital she received hate mail. She died on 8 June, aged 40, from a fracture at the base of her skull. Found in Davison's effects were the two suffragette flags, the return stub of her railway ticket to London, her race card, a ticket to a suffragette dance later that day and a diary with appointments for the following week. The King and Queen Mary were present at the race and made enquiries about the health of both Jones and Davison. The King later recorded in his diary that it was "a most regrettable and scandalous proceeding"; in her journal the Queen described Davison as a "horrid woman". Jones suffered a concussion and other injuries; he spent the evening of 4 June in London, before returning home the following day. He could recall little of the event: "She seemed to clutch at my horse, and I felt it strike her." He recovered sufficiently to race Anmer at Ascot Racecourse two weeks later.
 
The inquest into Davison's death took place at Epsom on 10 June; Jones was not well enough to attend. Davison's half-brother, Captain Henry Davison, gave evidence about his sister, saying that she was "a woman of very strong reasoning faculties, and passionately devoted to the women's movement". The coroner decided that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, Davison had not committed suicide. The coroner also decided that, although she had waited until she could see the horses, "from the evidence it was clear that the woman did not make for His Majesty's horse in particular". The verdict of the court was:
 
that Miss Emily Wilding Davison died of fracture of the base of the skull, caused by being accidentally knocked down by a horse through wilfully rushing on to the racecourse on Epsom Downs during the progress of the race for the Derby; death was due to misadventure.
 

Davison's purpose in attending the Derby and walking onto the course is unclear. She did not discuss her plans with anyone or leave a note. Several theories have been suggested, including that she intended to cross the track, believing that all horses had passed; that she wanted to pull down the King's horse; that she was trying to attach one of the WSPU flags to a horse; or that she intended to throw herself in front of one of the horses. The historian Elizabeth Crawford considers that "subsequent explanations of ... [Davison's] action have created a tangle of fictions, false deductions, hearsay, conjecture, misrepresentation and theory".
 
In 2013 a Channel 4 documentary used forensic examiners who digitised the original nitrate film from the three cameras present. The film was digitally cleaned and examined. Their examination suggests that Davison intended to throw a suffragette flag around the neck of a horse or attach it to the horse's bridle. A flag was gathered from the course; this was put up for auction and, as at 2021, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament. Michael Tanner, the horse-racing historian and author of a history of the 1913 Derby, doubts the authenticity of the item. Sotheby's, the auction house that sold it, describe it as a sash that was "reputed" to have been worn by Davison. The seller stated that her father, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's search of records shows Burton was listed as a dock labourer two weeks prior to the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course on the day of the Derby was Henry Mayson Dorling. When the police listed Davison's possessions, they itemised the two flags provided by the WSPU, both folded up and pinned to the inside of her jacket. They measured 44.5 by 27 inches (113 × 69 cm); the sash displayed at the Houses of Parliament measures 82 by 12 inches (210 × 30 cm).
 
Tanner considers that Davison's choice of the King's horse was "pure happenstance", as her position on the corner would have left her with a limited view. Examination of the newsreels by the forensic team employed by the Channel 4 documentary determined that Davison was closer to the start of the bend than had been previously assumed, and would have had a better view of the oncoming horses.
 
The contemporary news media were largely unsympathetic to Davison, and many publications "questioned her sanity and characterised her actions as suicidal". The Pall Mall Gazette said it had "pity for the dementia which led an unfortunate woman to seek a grotesque and meaningless kind of 'martyrdom' ", while The Daily Express described Davison as "A well-known malignant suffragette,  ... [who] has a long record of convictions for complicity in suffragette outrages." The journalist for The Daily Telegraph observed that "Deep in the hearts of every onlooker was a feeling of fierce resentment with the miserable woman"; the unnamed writer in The Daily Mirror opined that "It was quite evident that her condition was serious; otherwise many of the crowd would have fulfilled their evident desire to lynch her."
 
The WSPU were quick to describe her as a martyr, part of a campaign to identify her as such. The Suffragette newspaper marked Davison's death by issuing a copy showing a female angel with raised arms standing in front of the guard rail of a racecourse. The paper's editorial stated that "Davison has proved that there are in the twentieth-century people who are willing to lay down their lives for an ideal". Religious phraseology was used in the issue to describe her act, including "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends", which Gullickson reports as being repeated several times in subsequent discussions of the events. A year after the Derby, The Suffragette included "The Price of Liberty", an essay by Davison. In it, she had written "To lay down life for friends, that is glorious, selfless, inspiring! But to re-enact the tragedy of Calvary for generations yet unborn, that is the last consummate sacrifice of the Militant".

Funeral

On 14 June 1913 Davison's body was transported from Epsom to London; her coffin was inscribed "Fight on. God will give the victory." Five thousand women formed a procession, followed by hundreds of male supporters, that took the body between Victoria and Kings Cross stations; the procession stopped at St George's, Bloomsbury for a brief service led by its vicar, Charles Baumgarten, and Claude Hinscliff, who were members of the Church League for Women's Suffrage. The women marched in ranks wearing the suffragette colours of white and purple, which The Manchester Guardian described as having "something of the deliberate brilliance of a military funeral"; 50,000 people lined the route. The event, which was organised by Grace Roe, is described by June Purvis, Davison's biographer, as "the last of the great suffragette spectacles". Emmeline Pankhurst planned to be part of the procession, but she was arrested on the morning, ostensibly to be returned to prison under the "Cat and Mouse" Act (1913).
 
The coffin was taken by train to Newcastle upon Tyne with a suffragette guard of honour for the journey; crowds met the train at its scheduled stops. The coffin remained overnight at the city's central station before being taken to Morpeth. A procession of about a hundred suffragettes accompanied the coffin from the station to the St. Mary the Virgin church; it was watched by thousands. Only a few of the suffragettes entered the churchyard, as the service and interment were private. Her gravestone bears the WSPU slogan "Deeds not words".

Approach and analysis

Davison's death marked a culmination and a turning point of the militant suffragette campaign. The First World War broke out the following year and, on 10 August 1914, the government released all women hunger strikers and declared an amnesty. Emmeline Pankhurst suspended WSPU operations on 13 August. Pankhurst subsequently assisted the government in the recruitment of women for war work. In 1918 Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act 1918. Among the changes was the granting of the vote to women over the age of 30 who could pass property qualifications. The legislation added 8.5 million women to the electoral roll; they constituted 43% of the electorate. In 1928 the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act lowered the voting age for women to 21 to put them on equal terms with male voters.
 
Crawford sees the events at the 1913 Derby as a lens "through which ... [Davison's] whole life has been interpreted", and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history. Carolyn Collette, a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including "uncontrolled impulses" or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians "to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. Cicely Hale, a suffragette who worked at the WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as "a fanatic" who was prepared to die but did not mean to. Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did not mean to die.
 
Davison was a staunch feminist and a passionate Christian whose outlook "invoked both medieval history and faith in God as part of the armour of her militancy". Her love of English literature, which she had studied at Oxford, was shown in her identification with Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Tale, including being nicknamed "Faire Emelye". Much of Davison's writing reflected the doctrine of the Christian faith and referred to martyrs, martyrdom and triumphant suffering; according to Collette, the use of Christian and medieval language and imagery "directly reflects the politics and rhetoric of the militant suffrage movement". Purvis writes that Davison's committed Anglicanism would have stopped her from committing suicide because it would have meant that she could not be buried in consecrated ground. Davison wrote in "The Price of Liberty" about the high cost of devotion to the cause:
 
In the New Testament, the Master reminded His followers that when the merchant had found the Pearl of Great Price, he sold all that he had in order to buy it. That is the parable of Militancy! It is that which the women warriors are doing to-day.
Some are truer warriors than others, but the perfect Amazon is she who will sacrifice all even unto the last, to win the Pearl of Freedom for her sex.
 
Davison held a firm moral conviction that socialism was a moral and political force for good. She attended the annual May Day rallies in Hyde Park and, according to the historian Krista Cowman, "directly linked her militant suffrage activities with socialism". Her London and Morpeth funeral processions contained a heavy socialist presence in appreciation of her support for the cause.

Legacy

In 1968 a one-act play written by Joice Worters, Emily, was staged in Northumberland, focusing on the use of violence against the women's campaign. Davison is the subject of an opera, Emily (2013), by the British composer Tim Benjamin, and of "Emily Davison", a song by the American rock singer Greg Kihn. Davison also appears as a supporting character in the 2015 film Suffragette, in which she is portrayed by Natalie Press. Her death and funeral form the climax of the film. In January 2018 the cantata Pearl of Freedom, telling the story of Davison's suffragette struggles, was premiered. The music was by the composer Joanna Marsh; the librettist was David Pountney.

In 1990 the Labour MPs Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn placed a commemorative plaque inside the cupboard in which Davison had hidden eighty years earlier. In April 2013 a plaque was unveiled at Epsom racecourse to mark the centenary of her death. In January 2017 Royal Holloway announced that its new library would be named after her. The statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in April 2018, features Davison's name and picture, along with those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters, on the plinth of the statue. The Women's Library, at the London School of Economics, holds several collections related to Davison. They include her personal papers and objects connected to her death. In June 2023 English Heritage unveiled a blue plaque at 43 Fairholme Road, Kensington, London where she lived when at Kensington High School in 1880s. A statue of Davison, by the artist Christine Charlesworth, was installed in the marketplace at Epsom in 2021, following a campaign by volunteers from the Emily Davison Memorial Project.
The Battle of Almonacid was fought on 11 August 1809 during the Peninsular War between Sébastiani's IV Corps of the French Peninsular Army, which King Joseph of Spain had withdrawn from the Battle of Talavera to defend Madrid, and the Spanish Army of La Mancha under General Venegas. After the decisive charges of Polish uhlans, the battle resulted in a French victory.

Background
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 started with the Battle of Talavera.

Prelude

After the defeat at Talavera, King Joseph retreated with his French army to the vicinity of Toledo and ordered General Sébastiani to attack the portion of the Spanish La Mancha army threatening Madrid under the command of Venegas at Aranjuez. On 5 August, however, due in large part to the hastiness of the attack and the limited number of Tagus River crossings, Sébastiani and the French forces were defeated in a short battle at Aranjuez. Sébastiani chose next to flank Venegas by moving his army west, crossing the Tagus at Toledo, and then returning to the east to attack the Spanish. Venegas, however, anticipated that Sébastiani would attempt such a tactic and moved his forces westward south of the Tagus. On 10 August, both armies were concentrated in the vicinity of Almonacid. 

Venegas' Spanish force consisted of 22,000 infantry, more than 3,000 horses and 29 pieces of artillery, and was organized in five divisions commanded respectively by Luis Lacy, Gaspar de Vigodet, Pedro Agustín Girón, Francisco González de Castejón and Tomás de Zeraín. Miguel de los Ríos and the Marquess of Gelo served as Majors General of the cavalry and the infantry, while Brigadiers Antonio de la Cruz and Juan Bouligni were Commanders-in-chief of Artillery and Engineers. They were so confident of victory that they disregarded all the established rules for camping out during times of military conflict, especially being so close to the enemy.
Sébastiani's French force had crossed the Tagus on 9 August, settling that same day in the nearby town of Nambroca, a league away from Almonacid.

The Spanish commander, after hearing the opinion of the other generals, who agreed with him despite being aware of the retreat of the allied army from Talavera de la Reina towards Extremadura, decided to attack the French on 12 August in order to rest his troops. The French army anticipated this and appeared in front of the Spanish positions at half past five in the morning of 11 August, with 14,000 troops of the IV Corps commanded by Sebastiani, who attacked the Spanish immediately without waiting for the reserve under the command of Dessolles and King Joseph Bonaparte in person to come up.

The La Mancha army hastily positioned itself in front of Almonacid and on both sides in the following formation: Vigodet's division, a little behind, on the far right, with much of the cavalry; continuing to the left, Castejón's division was established on the Utrera hill, Zerain's division beside it covering the Santo hill, and Lacy's division closer at the Guazalate stream; the 3rd division, Girón's, acting as reserve, was spread between the heights of Cerrojones, on the extreme left and the key to the entire line of battle, and the Cerro de la Cruz or Castillo hill, named for the castle ruins on its summit.

Battle

First attacks
After intense artillery fire, returned in kind by the Spaniards, Jean François Leval with Polish and German-Dutch divisions attacked the Spanish left wing. The Bailén and Jaén battalions of the 3rd Division twice repelled the Poles, but received no reinforcement from the reserve. With the Polish division encouraged by the Germans coming up to their left, the French army was able to storm the vital position of the Cerrojones, even though at great cost (the three Polish regiments making up the division lost 47 officers). The French right was supported by a large body of troops advancing over the level ground at the foot of that hill, carrying out an envelopment on the extreme left, not stopped by a cavalry charge by the horsemen of Fernando VII and Granada, led by Colonel Antonio Zea and Commander Nicolás Chacón (Captain Francisco Soto died in this charge). The 1st division, in order to confront the Germans, had to withdraw somewhat and to reposition itself diagonally to the rearguard. However, as the centre and right were now retreating as well, under attack by the remaining enemy forces supported by the reserve which had just arrived under Dessolles and Joseph Bonaparte, this division was itself forced to take refuge on the Castillo hill.

Start of the battle
The 4th division was heavily attacked by numerous enemy artillery and could only respond with one horsedrawn battery. Their chief Lieutenant-Colonel, captain of the Artillery, Jose Chacón, soon fell mortally wounded and died from these injuries on 13 August in Tembleque. Lieutenant-Colonel Alvaro Chacón from this same Corps also died on the battlefield. The regiments of Jerez de la Frontera, Córdoba and the Spanish Guards distinguished themselves through their calmness and courage, the second under the command of its colonel Brigadier Francisco Carvajal. The cavalry on the right did not pursue the charge launched to contain the French, and thus the French were able to press their attack with continued vigour. The 5th division also yielded the field in a similar manner and it was not long before the enemy also occupied the town and the Castillo hill. There, the Spanish troops were unable to resist the terrible rain of projectiles that the French artillery aimed at them from all sides.

Vigodet's division intervened in time to prevent an immediate and disastrous defeat, speedily and skilfully carrying out a change of front, protected by lively fire from the Spanish guns. This manoeuvre contained the pursuit of the disorganised forces of the centre and also restored order on the left, where the Polish and German divisions threatened to surround the line completely and to cut off its retreat. There the 2nd division mounted renewed resistance to the advance of the victors, who then tried everywhere to break through this unexpected obstacle that was preventing them making the most of their victory. A large mass of Milhaud's much-feared dragoons charged towards the left, and in that last period of the battle the troops of Vigodet covered themselves in glory. All fought with courage and self-sacrifice: the artillery, firing during withdrawal, covering with shrapnel the heads of the imperial columns; the cavalry, formed by riders of different Corps that went about reuniting the dispersed troops, its steadfastness impressing the very top ranks of the enemy; and the infantry remaining imperturbable amidst the intense fire and the prevailing confusion and disorder.  A squad of grenadiers of the Provincial of Ronda sent by Lieutenant Antonio Espinosa, approaching the enemy horsemen with fixed bayonets, was able to stop them and even to pull away a cannon, which was spiked by their leader. The second lieutenant of artillery, Juan Montenegro, also managed to save a gun of his battery, sacrificing himself for his comrades-in-arms.  Only the unfortunate accident of an explosion among the ammunition carts, frightening the horses, produced some disorder of which the enemy took advantage, harassing and hounding more closely on the final ascents, to stab a few soldiers and to take some of the guns.

End of the battle
The French had already taken 2,500 losses and did not continue active pursuit beyond Mora. The defeated Spanish army was able to take the Andalusia highway and arrive in good order at Manzanares. However, on arriving there, false rumours that enemy forces were in Valdepeñas (Ciudad Real) caused many of the Spanish to disperse, not stopping until they got to the Sierra Morena. Spanish losses did not exceed 4,000 men, including those who were killed, wounded and imprisoned. However, among the dead was the commander of the infantry regiment of the first division, Colonel Vicente Martínez, and among the wounded was the colonel of the Granada dragoons, Diego Ballesteros, who remained a prisoner in France until the end of the war.

Aftermath
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 proceeded with the second Madrid offensive in the Battle of Tamames.

Legacy
To commemorate this military feat, a royal decree of 30 May 1816 created a military medal with the following inscription in the centre: "From Fernando VII", and around the edge: "In Almonacid, 11th August 1809").

ReferencesThe Old Turkic script (also known as variously Göktürk script, Orkhon script, Orkhon-Yenisey script, Turkic runes) was the alphabet used by the Göktürks and other early Turkic khanates from the 8th to 10th centuries to record the Old Turkic language.

The script is named after the Orkhon Valley in Mongolia where early 8th-century inscriptions were discovered in an 1889 expedition by Nikolai Yadrintsev. These Orkhon inscriptions were published by Vasily Radlov and deciphered by the Danish philologist Vilhelm Thomsen in 1893.

This writing system was later used within the Uyghur Khaganate. Additionally, a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Yenisei Kirghiz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian alphabet of the 10th century. Words were usually written from right to left.

Origins 
Many scientists, starting with Vilhelm Thomsen (1893), suggested that Orkhon script is derived from descendants of the Aramaic alphabet in particular via the Pahlavi and Sogdian alphabets of Persia, or possibly via Kharosthi used to write Sanskrit (cf. the Issyk inscription). Vilhelm Thomsen (1893) also mentioned some reports that the Orkhon script could derive from Hunno-Scythian alphabet, but rejected them as being specious. It has also been speculated that tamgas represent one of the sources of the Old Turkic script, but despite similarities in shape and forms, this hypothesis has been widely rejected as unverifiable, largely because early tamgas are too poorly attested and understood to be subject to a thorough comparison.

Contemporary Chinese sources conflict as to whether the Turks had a written language by the 6th century. The Book of Zhou, dating to the 7th century, mentions that the Turks had a written language similar to that of the Sogdians. Two other sources, the Book of Sui and the History of the Northern Dynasties, claim that the Turks did not have a written language. According to István Vásáry, Old Turkic script was invented under the rule of the first khagans and was modelled after the Sogdian fashion. Several variants of the script came into being as early as the first half of the 6th century.<ref>Sigfried J. de Laet, Joachim Herrmann, (1996), History of Humanity: From the seventh century B.C. to the seventh century A.D., p. 478</ref>

Corpus
The Old Turkic corpus consists of about two hundred inscriptions, plus a number of manuscripts.
The inscriptions, dating from the 7th to 10th century, were discovered in present-day Mongolia (the area of the Second Turkic Khaganate and the Uyghur Khaganate that succeeded it), in the upper Yenisey basin of central-south Siberia, and in smaller numbers, in the Altay mountains and Xinjiang. The texts are mostly epitaphs (official or private), but there are also graffiti and a handful of short inscriptions found on archaeological artifacts, including a number of bronze mirrors.

The website of the Language Committee of Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan lists 54 inscriptions from the Orkhon area, 106 from the Yenisei area, 15 from the Talas area, and 78 from the Altai area. The most famous of the inscriptions are the two monuments (obelisks) which were erected in the Orkhon Valley between 732 and 735 in honor of the Göktürk prince Kül Tigin and his brother the emperor Bilge Kağan. The Tonyukuk inscription, a monument situated somewhat farther east, is slightly earlier, dating to ca. 722. These inscriptions relate in epic language the legendary origins of the Turks, the golden age of their history, their subjugation by the Chinese (Tang-Gokturk wars), and their liberation by Bilge.

The Old Turkic manuscripts, of which there are none earlier than the 9th century, were found in present-day Xinjiang and represent Old Uyghur, a different Turkic dialect from the one represented in the Old Turkic inscriptions in the Orkhon valley and elsewhere. They include Irk Bitig, a 9th-century manuscript book on divination.

 Table of characters 

Old Turkic being a synharmonic language, a number of consonant signs are divided into two "synharmonic sets", one for front vowels and the other for back vowels. Such vowels can be taken as intrinsic to the consonant sign, giving the Old Turkic alphabet an aspect of an abugida script. In these cases, it is customary to use superscript numerals ¹ and ² to mark consonant signs used with back and front vowels, respectively. This convention was introduced by Thomsen (1893), and followed by Gabain (1941), Malov (1951) and Tekin (1968).

Other consonantal signs

A colon-like symbol (⁚) is sometimes used as a word separator. In some cases a ring (⸰) is used instead.

A reading example (right to left): 𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃 transliterated t²ñr²i, this spells the name of the Turkic sky god, Täñri.

 Variants 

Variants of the script were found from Mongolia and Xinjiang in the east to the Balkans in the west. The preserved inscriptions were dated to between the 8th and 10th centuries.

These alphabets are divided into four groups by Kyzlasov (1994) 
 Asiatic group (includes Orkhon proper)
 Eurasiatic group
 Southern Europe group

The Asiatic group is further divided into three related alphabets:
 Orkhon alphabet, Göktürks, 8th to 10th centuries
 Yenisei alphabet,
 Talas alphabet, a derivative of the Yenisei alphabet, Kangly or Karluks 8th to 10th centuries. Talas inscriptions include Terek-Say rock inscriptions found in the 1897, Koysary text, Bakaiyr gorge inscriptions, Kalbak-Tash 6 and 12 inscriptions, Talas alphabet has 29 identified letters.

The Eurasiatic group is further divided into five related alphabets:
 Achiktash, used in Sogdia 8th to 10th centuries.
 South-Yenisei, used by the Göktürks 8th to 10th centuries.
 Two especially similar alphabets: the Don alphabet, used by the Khazars, 8th to 10th centuries; and the Kuban alphabet, used by the Bulgars, 8th to 13th centuries. Inscriptions in both alphabets are found in the Pontic–Caspian steppe and on the banks of the Kama river.
 Tisza, used by the Pechenegs 8th to 10th centuries.

A number of alphabets are incompletely collected due to the limitations of the extant inscriptions. Evidence in the study of the Turkic scripts includes Turkic-Chinese bilingual inscriptions, contemporaneous Turkic inscriptions in the Greek alphabet, literal translations into Slavic languages, and paper fragments with Turkic cursive writing from religion, Manichaeism, Buddhist, and legal subjects of the 8th to 10th centuries found in Xinjiang.

 Unicode 

The Unicode block for Old Turkic is U+10C00–U+10C4F. It was added to the Unicode standard in October 2009, with the release of version 5.2. It includes separate "Orkhon" and "Yenisei" variants of individual characters.

Since Windows 8 Unicode Old Turkic writing support was added in the Segoe font.
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter. The cause is often a trigger such as from viral infection or vaccinations.

ADEM's symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases. However, ADEM has several features that distinguish it from MS. Unlike MS, ADEM occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever, although adolescents and adults can get the disease too. ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups (or relapses), over a long period of time. Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients, but the majority of these 'multiphasic' presentations following ADEM likely represent MS. ADEM is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness, coma and death, which is very rare in MS, except in severe cases.

It affects about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year. Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and adolescents, with the average age around 5 to 8 years old. The disease affects males and females almost equally. ADEM shows seasonal variation with higher incidence in winter and spring months which may coincide with higher viral infections during these months. The mortality rate may be as high as 5%; however, full recovery is seen in 50 to 75% of cases with increase in survival rates up to 70 to 90% with figures including minor residual disability as well. The average time to recover from ADEM flare-ups is one to six months.

ADEM produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the white matter. Usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord, but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex, thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved.

When a person has more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM). Also, a fulminant course in adults has been described.

Signs and symptoms
ADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days. Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.

ADEM in COVID-19 
Neurological symptoms were the main presentation of COVID-19, which did not correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms. The high incidence of ADEM with hemorrhage is striking. Brain inflammation is likely caused by an immune response to the disease rather than neurotropism. CSF analysis was not indicative of an infectious process, neurological impairment was not present in the acute phase of the infection, and neuroimaging findings were not typical of classical toxic and metabolic disorders. The finding of bilateral periventricular relatively asymmetrical lesions allied with deep white matter involvement, that may also be present in cortical gray-white matter junction, thalami, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem suggests an acute demyelination process. Additionally, hemorrhagic white matter lesions, clusters of macrophages related to axonal injury and ADEM-like appearance were also found in subcortical white matter.

Causes
Since the discovery of the anti-MOG specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis it is considered that ADEM is one of the possible clinical causes of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis.

About how the anti-MOG antibodies appear in the patients serum there are several theories:
 A preceding antigenic challenge can be identified in approximately two-thirds of people. Some viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, dengue, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, coxsackievirus and COVID-19. Bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci.
 Exposure to vaccines: The only vaccine proven related to ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use only small samples or are case studies. Large-scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than the risk of developing ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incidence rates as high as 1 in 600.
 In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation.

Diagnosis

The term ADEM has been inconsistently used at different times. Currently, the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the International Pediatric MS Study Group, revision 2007.

Given that the definition is clinical, it is currently unknown if all the cases of ADEM are positive for anti-MOG autoantibody; in any case, it appears to be strongly related to ADEM diagnosis.

Differential diagnosis

Multiple sclerosis
While ADEM and MS both involve autoimmune demyelination, they differ in many clinical, genetic, imaging, and histopathological aspects. Some authors consider MS and its borderline forms to constitute a spectrum, differing only in chronicity, severity, and clinical course, while others consider them discretely different diseases.

Typically, ADEM appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults, and can also be clinically multiphasic.

Problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of multiple sclerosis. If MS were defined only by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as McDonald did, it would not be enough to make a difference, as some cases of ADEM satisfy these conditions. Therefore, some authors propose to establish the dividing line as the shape of the lesions around the veins, being therefore "perivenous vs. confluent demyelination".

The pathology of ADEM is very similar to that of MS with some differences. The pathological hallmark of ADEM is perivenous inflammation with limited "sleeves of demyelination". Nevertheless, MS-like plaques (confluent demyelination) can appear

Plaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the glial scar in ADEM is smooth. Axons are better preserved in ADEM lesions. Inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined, and finally, lesions are strictly perivenous, while in MS they are disposed around veins, but not so sharply.

Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy or even postmortem  ADEM in adults can progress to MS

Multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis

When the person has more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM).

It has been found that anti-MOG auto-antibodies are related to this kind of ADEM

Another variant of ADEM in adults has been described, also related to anti-MOG auto-antibodies, has been named fulminant disseminated encephalomyelitis, and it has been reported to be clinically ADEM, but showing MS-like lesions on autopsy. It has been classified inside the anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases.

Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis

Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL, or AHLE), acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE), Weston-Hurst syndrome, or Hurst's disease, is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM. AHL is relatively rare (less than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature), it is seen in about 2% of ADEM cases, and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage, and edema. Death is common in the first week and overall mortality is about 70%, but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. About 70% of survivors show residual neurological deficits, but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the extent of the white matter affected.

This disease has been occasionally associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, malaria, sepsis associated with immune complex deposition, methanol poisoning, and other underlying conditions. Also anecdotal association with MS has been reported

Laboratory studies that support diagnosis of AHL are: peripheral leukocytosis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis associated with normal glucose and increased protein. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lesions of AHL typically show extensive T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) white matter hyperintensities with areas of hemorrhages, significant edema, and mass effect.

Treatment
No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.

There is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately
In a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases – with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy – were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered. A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids. A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor. This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.

Prognosis
Full recovery is seen in 50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as mRS or EDSS), average time to recover is one to six months. The mortality rate may be as high as 5–10%. Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes. The latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever, or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present. 

ADEM can progress to MS. It will be considered MS if some lesions appear in different times and brain areas

Motor deficits
Residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis.

Neurocognitive
Patients with demyelinating illnesses, such as MS, have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability. Research suggests that similar effects are seen after ADEM, but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in MS. A study of six children with ADEM (mean age at presentation 7.7 years) were tested for a range of neurocognitive tests after an average of 3.5 years of recovery. All six children performed in the normal range on most tests, including verbal IQ and performance IQ, but performed at least one standard deviation below age norms in at least one cognitive domain, such as complex attention (one child), short-term memory (one child) and internalizing behaviour/affect (two children). Group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms, demonstrating that, as a group, they were normal. These deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of MS.

Another study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls. Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the late onset (average IQ 100) and control groups (average IQ 106), while the late onset ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.

Research

The relationship between ADEM and anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis is currently under research. A new entity called MOGDEM has been proposed.

About animal models, the main animal model for MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is also an animal model for ADEM. Being an acute monophasic illness, EAE is far more similar to ADEM than MS.
Hareid is a municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is part of the Sunnmøre region. The administrative centre is the village of Hareid. The other main population centers are Brandal and Hjørungavåg.

The municipality is situated off the mainland coast of Sunnmøre, on an island named Hareidlandet, which it shared with Ulstein Municipality, the commercial capital of the area. Hareid is regarded as the cultural capital with its annual Hareidsstemne and many choirs. It is also an important traffic hub in Sunnmøre and is connected by ferry to the neighboring island of Sula which in turn is connected to the city of Ålesund and the island of Valderøya. The municipality is connected to the mainland via the Eiksund Bridge and Eiksund Tunnel through Ulstein.

The  municipality is the 336th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Hareid is the 180th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 5,126. The municipality's population density is  and its population has increased by 2.5% over the previous 10-year period.

General information

The municipality of Hareid was established on 1 January 1917 when it was separated from Ulstein Municipality to form a municipality of its own. Originally, the municipality included the eastern part of Hareidlandet island and the southwestern part of the nearby island of Sula. The initial population of the municipality was 2,310. On 1 July 1958, the southwestern part of the island of Sula (population: 68) was transferred from Hareid Municipality to Borgund Municipality.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Hareid farm, since the first Hareid Church was built there. The first element is the genitive case of the name of the island  (now Hareidlandet). The meaning of the old island name is uncertain, but it is speculated that it might be connected to the Norse god, Höðr. The last element is  which means "isthmus".

Coat of arms
The coat of arms was granted on 11 January 1985. The official blazon is "Azure, three arrowheads argent points to chief". This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is three arrowhead symbols that are pointing upwards. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The arrowheads were chosen as a symbol for the Battle of Hjörungavágr in 986, in which Earl Håkon defeated the Danish Vikings. This battle played an important role in the struggle by Håkon to unite the whole of Norway. Since the battle took place in the municipality, the arrowheads were considered an appropriate symbol. The arms were designed by Jarle Skuseth. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

Churches
The Church of Norway has one parish within the municipality of Hareid. It is part of the Søre Sunnmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre.

Government
All municipalities in Norway are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality falls under the Møre og Romsdal District Court and the Frostating Court of Appeal.

Harrisonburg is a village in and the parish seat of Catahoula Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 348 as of the 2010 census, down from 746 in 2000.

Riley J. Wilson, who held Louisiana's 5th congressional district seat from 1915 to 1937, resided in Harrisonburg, where he was principal of Harrisonburg High School and then an attorney, district attorney, and state district court judge prior to his election to Congress.

History 
Harrisonburg was named for the Harrison family of Virginia.

Fort Beauregard, located on a bluff in the northern corner of the village, was a Confederate stronghold during the American Civil War. In 1863, the fort successfully defended Harrisonburg from the attack of four Union gunboats coming from the Black River to the Ouachita River. After four days of bombardment, little damage was done, and the gunboats retired down river.  Harrisonburg and fort were evacuated before Brig. General Crocker's considerable naval and army forces arrived on September 4, 1863. The Confederates lost eight significant artillery pieces although two large 32 pound cannons were preserved. On March 1 through the 4, 1864 the town was again attacked by Union gunboats, but the falling river level prevented the advance on Monroe.

The village of Harrisonburg formerly staged reenactments at Fort Beauregard, also known as Fort Hill, but those ceremonies ended in the late 20th century. These reenactments were brought back to life for 2015, but halted in 2016, still planned for future years to come.

Harrisonburg was once a trade capital because of its location on the Ouachita River, with easy access to the Mississippi River and New Orleans. The Harrisonburg Road ran through the area as it crossed Louisiana between Mississippi's Natchez Trace and Texas' El Camino Real.

Harrisonburg was considered for the new site of the Louisiana state capital when the legislature decided to move it from New Orleans after the Civil War.

Geography
Harrisonburg is located in northern Catahoula Parish at  (31.772177, -91.827403), on the west bank of the Ouachita River. Louisiana State Highway 8 passes through the village, leading northeast across the Ouachita to Sicily Island, and southwest  to U.S. Route 84 near Catahoula Lake. Jonesville, the largest town in Catahoula Parish, is  south of Harrisonburg via Highway 124.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Harrisonburg has a total area of , of which  is land and , or 8.07%, is water.

Demographics

As of the census of 2000, there were 746 people, 142 households, and 91 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 157 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 43.43% White, 54.83% African American, 1.47% Asian, and 0.27% from two or more races.

There were 142 households, out of which 25.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 42.3% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.9% were non-families. 34.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 22.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.24.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 13.4% under the age of 18, 22.4% from 18 to 24, 42.5% from 25 to 44, 12.2% from 45 to 64, and 9.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 273.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 316.8 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $21,786, and the median income for a family was $31,250. Males had a median income of $15,000 versus $14,167 for females. The per capita income for the village was $6,242, making it the poorest census-designated place in the state. About 17.1% of families and 27.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.2% of those under age 18 and 25.7% of those age 65 or over.

The village is currently undergoing a dramatic demographic decline. It runs the risk of becoming a ghost town.

Climate
The climate consists of hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.  According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Harrisonburg has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.
Sumner is a coastal seaside suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand and was surveyed and named in 1849 in honour of John Bird Sumner, the then newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury and president of the Canterbury Association.  Originally a separate borough, it was amalgamated with the city of Christchurch as communications improved and the economies of scale made small town boroughs uneconomic to operate.

Toponymy

Captain Thomas named the settlement for Bishop John Bird Sumner, one of the leading members of the Canterbury Association.

The Ngāi Tahu name for the beach between Cave Rock (Tuawera) and Scarborough is Matuku Tako Tako. This name has been used by both the state primary school and the city libraries.

A. W. Reed gives the Māori name for  is Ohikaparuparu ("o" means place of; "hika" means rubbing, kindling, or planting; "paruparu" means dirt, deeply laden, or a preparation of fermented cockles). However, J. F Menzies indicates this name is associated with a settlement on the shores of the estuary between Redcliffs and Mt Pleasant and prefers an alternative translation of "The place where sticks were rubbed together to make a fire with which to cook cockles in preparation for a journey". Andersen places this name on the beach at the mouth of the estuary, near Shag Rock (Rapanui). James Cowan, retelling Sir Maui Pomare, indicates this name applies to the estuary shallows and means "fall in the mud".

History

Sumner was surveyed in 1849 by Edward Jollie for Captain Joseph Thomas, the advanced agent of the Canterbury Association. Jollie's November 1849 map showed 527 sections and numerous reserved and provisions for churches, schools, cemeteries, town hall, emigration barracks and other town amenities. However, his plans were abandoned through lack of funds and a new survey on which Sumner is based was carried out in 1860.

The first European to carry out work in Sumner is believed to be Charles Crawford, a whaleboat owner, who transported materials from Port Cooper, now Lyttelton, under contract to build the headquarters and storeroom for Captain Thomas. Sumner was settled in late 1849 or early 1850 by work crews building the road to Lyttelton, Sumner is thus one of the oldest European settlements in the Christchurch area. The Day family was the first to settle permanently in Sumner followed by Edward Dobson and his family.

Sumner had its first shop early in 1870, and its proprietor, S.E. Horneman, was postmaster from 1873 until 1876.

In 1872, it came under the control of the Heathcote Road District. When provincial councils were disestablished in 1876 and replaced with counties, Sumner had a second parent body, the Selwyn County added to the continuing road board. In 1883, Sumner was constituted as a town district and was run by a board of five elected commissioners. The board elected its own chairmen, and the two people who filled that role were C. L. Wiggins (March 1883 – September 1884) and J. M. Wheeler (September 1884 – June 1891). On 1 June 1891, Sumner was proclaimed a borough. Mayoral elections were held on 27 June, and the last chairman was elected the first Mayor of Sumner.

In 1885 the Harbour Board granted the concession to build a bath at the East end of Sumner beach. S.L. Bell enclosed some of the sea, built dressing sheds and a tea shop. The bathing pool was a great attraction but every year terrific storms would batter the bath and gradually dump fine sand. Eventually a flood filled the bath with clay and silt from the hills causing its closure.

In 1912 Sumner established its own gasworks and electricity was connected in 1918. The Anglican evangelical leader William Orange was vicar of Sumner from 1930–1945.

On 22 February 2011, Sumner was hit by the Christchurch earthquake, which destroyed or made uninhabitable a large number of the local houses and commercial buildings.  On 13 June the same year, Sumner was hit by another earthquake of almost the same magnitude as the February event. These two earthquakes caused many of Sumner's iconic cliffs to collapse, and many areas to be cordoned off with both traditional fences and shipping containers.

Geography

Sumner is nestled in a coastal valley separated from the adjacent city suburbs by rugged volcanic hill ridges that end in cliffs that descend to the sea shore in places.  Sumner Bay is the first bay on the northern side of Banks Peninsula and faces Pegasus Bay and the Pacific Ocean.

Because of its ocean exposure, a high surf can form in some swell conditions. The beach is gently sloping, with fine grey sand.  It is a popular surf beach for these reasons.

Sand dunes have filled the river valley behind the beach.  This has made housing construction relatively easy, although flooding at the head of the valley has been a problem in the past due to the reverse slope caused by the sand dunes filling the front of the valley.  This has been addressed by a flood drain.

A sea wall and wide esplanade have been built along the length of the beach to prevent coastal erosion.

The rocky volcanic outcrop of Cave Rock, or Tuawera dominates the beach. Until the mid-1860s, this feature was known by Europeans as Cass Rock, after the surveyor Thomas Cass. There are other rocky outcrops in the area and the volcanic nature of the geology is readily apparent from several of the exposed cliffs around the valley.

Shag Rock, or Rapanui, is another large volcanic outcrop at the western end of the beach and sits at the mouth of the Estuary formed by the Avon and Heathcote rivers. This landmark was shattered by the Christchurch earthquakes in 2011, which reduced the iconic rock to a pile of boulders.

Sumner bar

The Sumner Bar is a sand bar where the estuary meets the sea and is notoriously dangerous to cross. The outlet of the Avon Heathcote Estuary, at the western end of the beach, forms the Sumner bar off shore of Cave Rock.  The Sumner bar presents a major hazard to shipping, while the fast currents, strong rips and undertows in the area can be a danger to swimmers.

In December 1854, Commander Byron Drury, in HMS Pandora, surveyed the Sumner Bay, including the bar and mouth of the Avon-Heathcote Estuary for the Canterbury Provincial Council. Drury wrote a report and produced a detailed chart of the area, with soundings. Commander Drury's 1854 chart locates several buildings on shore, including a store at the foot of the hill in Clifton Bay, Day's house, which is set well back from the foreshore on a bend in the road, as it turns away from the foot of Clifton hill, and Dobson's house, which is shown at end of the spur at the foot of Richmond Hill. Compared to a modern-day map, the Day's house would have been near the corner at the top end of Nayland Street while Dobson's house would be near the intersection of Nayland Street and Wakefield Avenue.

The earliest recorded accident crossing the Sumner Bar occurred in May 1845 when a whaleboat capsized, without loss of life. The earliest recorded loss of life was in 1851 when a dinghy capsizes and two men aboard drowned. The cutter Hawk broke up crossing the Sumner Bar in rough weather at the end of June 1851 and wrecked on the beach, though the crew survived, the cargo was plundered.  Fifteen more vessels were recorded as stranding on the bar between 1851 and 1867, with 7 being total losses.

One regular vessel crossing the bar in the early days was the Mullogh, New Zealand's first iron hulled steamer. On 25 August 1865 the Mullogh ran onto Cave Rock, Sumner, in violent surf. Her cargo of liquor created keen interest on the beach. George Holmes of Pigeon Bay, the contractor for the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel, then bought the ship, refitted and used her until 1869.

The NZ Trawler Muriel was stranded on Sumner Beach in 1937 and was a total loss and had to be dismantled where she lay.

Community
Sumner is a focal point for the adjacent suburbs of Clifton, Richmond Hill and Scarborough. In earlier times, residents of those suburbs would often have been considered to be living in Sumner, because these suburbs have road access via Sumner or depend on services available in Sumner. Before 1945, Sumner was a separate borough from Christchurch City. Also, before seven-digit landline telephone numbering was implemented in Christchurch (late 1980s or early 1990s), telephone subscribers in these suburbs would have had a four-digit Sumner telephone exchange number.

Demographics
The statistical area of Sumner, which includes Scarborough and Te Onepoto / Taylors Mistake, covers . It had an estimated population of  as of  with a population density of  people per km2.

Sumner had a population of 3,519 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 36 people (1.0%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 249 people (-6.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,338 households. There were 1,752 males and 1,764 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. The median age was 42.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 714 people (20.3%) aged under 15 years, 483 (13.7%) aged 15 to 29, 1,806 (51.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 516 (14.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 95.6% European/Pākehā, 4.9% Māori, 0.6% Pacific peoples, 2.1% Asian, and 2.5% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).

The proportion of people born overseas was 29.5%, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people objected to giving their religion, 57.6% had no religion, 33.5% were Christian, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,113 (39.7%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 216 (7.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $43,600, compared with $31,800 nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,419 (50.6%) people were employed full-time, 501 (17.9%) were part-time, and 66 (2.4%) were unemployed.

Government

Sumner is administered by the Christchurch City Council.

The Canterbury Association initially administered Sumner, with the valley being surveyed by Edward Jollie in 1849 and he drew up a street plan in November of that year. However, the planned settlement was rejected by Godley and the land was not subdivided. When the first allocation of rural sections was made public in February 1851, rural section No.2 was allocated to Felix Wakefield. This section was bounded in the North by a road along the coast, in the West by the road between Christchurch and Lyttelton, by an accommodation road against the hillside in the East and another accommodation road across the valley in the South. The street names on the 1850 settlement plan were not used and Wakefield subdivided and leased or sold off parts of this rural section in smaller lots to create a settlement he called Wakefield Township.

After the Canterbury Association was disestablished, Sumner came under the control of the Canterbury Provincial Council. This lasted until the provinces were disestablished in 1876 and county councils were established instead. Sumner came under the jurisdiction of the Selwyn County Council initially.

A Town Board was established during the 1870s.

By the end of the 1880s Sumner had become a borough and administered the still mostly rural suburbs east of Ferrymead, including Mount Pleasant, Redcliffs, Moncks Bay, Clifton and Richmond Hill as well as the mostly undeveloped land between Scarborough and Godley Head, including Taylors Mistake.

By the 1940s, small town boroughs were becoming uneconomic and Sumner was merged with Christchurch city.

Culture and heritage

Architecture
The Pascoe House in Colenso Street is a category II historic place and an early example of a two story private dwelling in the Post War Modern Domestic style of the 1940–1960. It was designed by architect Paul Pascoe and constructed in 1948 as his own private home.

Transport
The need for a convenient route between the Port at Lyttelton and the plains settlement of Christchurch was quickly recognised by Captain Thomas, Chief Surveyor for the Canterbury Association. Settlement of flat land at Sumner was also planned at an early stage.

By sea
The Sumner Bar is a notable navigation hazard, though it can be crossed safely in the right wind, tide and sea conditions. However, with an exposed coast and no safe anchorage immediately off-shore, good seamanship is also required.

There is a small boat harbour, protected by a substantial breakwater, at the south-eastern end of Sumner Bay, below Scarborough. There is a slipway for launching small boats from a trailer, as well as the lifeboat station.  However, the area has a tendency to silt up, as it is still exposed to wind and sea.

In 1849, this area was known as Sumner Nook and was the only comparatively safe place in the bay for landing from a boat, because of a lagoon formed by a small stream running into the sea in this area. But, with Sumner Bay open to the Pacific Ocean, there was no nearby safe anchorage for larger ships, short of Lyttelton Harbour, about 8 nautical miles away by sea. An early proposal, by Captain Thomas, was to builds a jetty here to unload ships and transport the cargo by tramway to the estuary beyond Shag Rock, to avoid ships having to cross the Sumner Bar, but a land option was chosen instead.

By land
A convenient land route between Lyttelton to Christchurch has been a requirement from the beginning of Canterbury settlement. While rail and road tunnels between Lyttelton to Christchurch have been constructed, there remains the need to transport goods that are too dangerous or too large to travel through one of the tunnel. The route via Sumner remains a necessary transport alternative.

Construction of a road from Lyttelton to Christchurch via Evans Pass and Sumner began in 1849. However, progress was slow due to steep hillsides and hard volcanic rock being encountered. In 1850, a Bridle Path was cut directly over the saddle between Lyttelton and the Heathcote Valley so that the early settlers could travel to Ferrymead by foot and pack horse, while their heavy goods still needed to be transported across the Sumner Bar by boat. Road construction on the western side of the Sumner valley ceased in 1851 when construction encountered steep volcanic bluffs and funds ran out. The original road line, now known as Captain Thomas' Track, was abandoned and a new way down the eastern side of the valley between Evans Pass and Sumner was subsequently found and constructed.

Public transport

A tramway opened to Sumner on 1 November 1888.

Education

Sumner School 
Sumner School was founded in 1876 and is these days a full primary school, teaching children from years 1 to 8. The school has a roll of  students as of

Our Lady Star of the Sea School 
Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic School is a full primary school, teaching children from years 1 to 8. The school has a roll of  students. It opened in 1928.

Ko Taku Reo 

The former van Asch College, which took hearing-impaired children from all over the South Island and the southern North Island, is now a residential campus for Ko Taku Reo. It opened in 1880 as Sumner School for the Deaf.

Sumner College 
Variously known as "Sumner College", "Beach Glen Boarding School" or "Chelford", existed in Sumner between about 1877 and 1895. Schoolmaster C. L. Wiggins, as he was almost invariably known, appears to have moved his boarding school for young gentlemen to Sumner in August 1877, according to newspaper advertisements of the time. Wiggins has previously operated his boarding school at Akaroa and Fernside, before moving to Sumner. The school taught "the usual branches of a sound English education, together with Latin and French" and provided recreations including sea bathing, cricket, and "pedestrian excursions". Wiggins expanded his school at Sumner and built the dormitories and school rooms that were later leased and then sold to the Government School for the Deaf in the mid 1880s. From 1896, Wiggans was the Assistant Master in the Lower School of Christ's College. He subsequently founded a preparatory school in Durham Street, where he taught until he was 80 years old.

Clement Lester Wiggins was born in England in 1843, and educated at various schools before arriving in Lyttelton in 1861, aged 18. By 1870, he had become headmaster of the Akaroa public school, and served there for three years, before founding a private boarding school. He was also a church organist, Sunday school teacher, a founding member of the Sumner Lawn Tennis Club, and involved in local body politics. He died on 18 August 1927, aged 84.

Sumner Life Boat Institution

Because of the hazard posed by the Sumner Bar, Sumner has had a lifeboat of some kind almost since its settlement. There is no record of a formal or even informal lifeboat being available prior to the appointment of a pilot in September 1864. However, it is likely that small open rowing boats were available in the bay from the early 1850s.

The Sumner Life Boat Institution has operated a formal life boat or similar rescue craft in the bay since 1898.  The traditional name of Rescue has been applied to three of the life boats.

Empire is a village on Lake Michigan in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Located in southwestern Leelanau County, its population was 362 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Empire Township, and is famous for its proximity to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Empire is home to the lakeshore's headquarters, the Philip A. Hart Visitor Center.

History

Empire was founded in 1851. It was incorporated as a village in 1895 with E. R. Dailey, the head of the Empire Lumber Company which was the main employer here, as the first president of the village. The city was named after the schooner "Empire", which was icebound in the city during a storm in 1865.

The Empire Lumber Company operated from 1887 to 1917, dominating this once booming lumber town. George Aylsworth operated the first mill between 1873 and 1883. Potter and Struthers built a second mill in 1885, which T. Wilce Company purchased in 1887. Called the Empire Lumber Company, it expanded to one of the largest and best equipped hardwood mills in the area, capable of producing up to 20 million feet of lumber a year. Docks, several businesses, and a railroad sprang up in Empire. Destroyed by fire in 1906, the mill was quickly rebuilt. The mill burned again in 1917. With most of the nearby virgin timber gone, the mill was not replaced.

The local Robert H. Manning Memorial Light was built in 1991 by O'Brien Brothers Construction as a memorial to Robert H. Manning, a lifelong resident of Empire and avid fisherman.  Additionally, the beach has an antique anchor which was discovered by Douglas Manning, son of Robert H. Manning, and Michelle Stryker in 1977.  Every year, the village of Empire celebrates the raising of the anchor on the third Saturday in July.

The Empire Bluffs lie to the south and the sand dunes of the National Lakeshore lie to the north, the area has views of the dunes, North Manitou and South Manitou islands, and Lake Michigan.  Most Sleeping Bear Dunes panoramas portrayed on postcards are taken from a walking trail which runs to the top of the Empire Bluffs. A wide beach separates Lake Michigan from its close neighbor, South Bar Lake. The much smaller South Bar Lake stays considerably warmer than the big lake during the summer months.

The small village of Empire is located up a short hill, just a few minutes walk from the beach.

Terrace Park is a village in Hamilton County, Ohio, and a wealthy suburb of Greater Cincinnati. The population was 2,355 at the 2020 census.

History

The primary document for the history of Terrace Park is "A Place Called Terrace Park" by Ellis Rawnsley (1992).

Rawnsley notes that the earliest human inhabitants of Terrace Park may have arrived as early as 12,000 years ago—the Paleo-Indians.  Although "no traces of established settlements have ever been found," flints showing evidence of these nomadic people have been found in various locations in the areas surrounding Terrace Park.

Circa approximately 1000 B.C., settlements appeared in Hamilton County, Ohio.

According to Rawnsley, "Two thousand or more years ago, a primitive people built, in what is now Terrace Park, one of the largest of its kind of the 295 prehistoric earthworks ever found in Hamilton County."

Mounds from the Adena culture are found throughout a wide area which contains Terrace Park.

In January 1789, Abraham Covalt established a small fortified settlement called Covalt Station in what is now Terrace Park. The area was surrounded by Shawnee settlements, and the Shawnee were hostile towards the white settlement in their midst. Covalt Station had to be abandoned in 1792 due to continuing attacks by the Shawnee, and white settlers only returned after General "Mad Anthony" Wayne defeated the Native American Western Confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers and secured the Treaty of Greenville which ceded all of southern Ohio (and other territory) to the United States. Before roads and railroads connected the village to other nearby settlements, such as Milford, most residents of Terrace Park kept cattle and chickens, and engaged in other agricultural activities for their own subsistence, and had "homesteads" as opposed to the ordered residential village of today.

Terrace Park was incorporated in 1893.

The John Robinson Circus, founded by John H. Robinson, had its winter home in Terrace Park until 1916.  During the time that the circus wintered in Terrace Park, it was not unusual for elephants to roam free about the village, until the village council asked in 1910 that they be restrained. The famous elephant Tillie was known to walk the streets of Terrace Park, where she is now buried.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a 501(c)(3) professional association for electronics engineering, electrical engineering, and other related disciplines with its corporate office in New York City and its operations center in Piscataway, New Jersey. The IEEE was formed from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1963.

Due to its expansion of scope into so many related fields, the organization no longer uses its full name in words except as a legal identifier; in normal use, it is always referred to by the initials  (pronounced I-triple-E). , it is the world's largest association of technical professionals with more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries around the world. Its objectives are the educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronics engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering, and other similar disciplines.

History

Origins 

The IEEE traces its founding to 1884 and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. In 1912, the rival Institute of Radio Engineers was formed. Although the AIEE was initially larger, the IRE attracted more students and was larger by the mid-1950s. The AIEE and IRE merged in 1963.

The IEEE is headquartered in New York City, but most business is done at the IEEE Operations Center in Piscataway, New Jersey, opened in 1975.

Growth 
The American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) merged to create the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) on January 1, 1963. At that time, the combined group had 150,000 members, 93%  in the United States. By 1984 there were 250,000 members, 20% of whom were outside the U.S.

The Australian Section of the IEEE existed between 1972 and 1985. After this date, it split into state- and territory-based sections.

, IEEE has over 400,000 members in 160 countries, with the U.S. based membership no longer constituting a majority.

Publications

IEEE claims to produce over 30% of the world's literature in the electrical, electronics, and computer engineering fields, publishing approximately 200 peer-reviewed journals and magazines. IEEE publishes more than 1,200 conference proceedings every year.

The published content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences sponsored by the IEEE are available in the IEEE Electronic Library (IEL) available through IEEE Xplore platform, for subscription-based access and individual publication purchases.

In addition to journals and conference proceedings, the IEEE also publishes tutorials and standards that are produced by its standardization committees. The organization also has its own IEEE paper format.

Educational activities
The IEEE provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology.

IEEE offers educational opportunities such as IEEE eLearning Library,  the Education Partners Program,  Standards in Education, and Continuing Education Units (CEUs).

IEEE eLearning Library is a collection of online educational courses designed for self-paced learning. Education Partners, exclusive for IEEE members, offers on-line degree programs, certifications and courses at a 10% discount. The Standards in Education website explains what standards are and the importance of developing and using them. The site includes tutorial modules and case illustrations to introduce the history of standards, the basic terminology, their applications and impact on products, as well as news related to standards, book reviews and links to other sites that contain information on standards. Currently, forty states in the United States require Professional Development Hours (PDH) to maintain a Professional Engineering license, encouraging engineers to seek Continuing Education Units (CEUs) for their participation in continuing education programs. CEUs readily translate into Professional Development Hours (PDHs), with 1 CEU being equivalent to 10 PDHs. Countries outside the United States, such as South Africa, similarly require continuing professional development (CPD) credits, and it is anticipated that IEEE Expert Now courses will feature in the CPD listing for South Africa.

IEEE also sponsors a website designed to help young people better understand engineering. This website allows students to search for accredited engineering degree programs in Canada and the United States.

Through the Student Activities Committee, IEEE facilitates partnership between student activities and all other IEEE entities.

Technical bodies

Technical societies
Various technical areas are addressed by IEEE's 39 societies, each one focused on a certain knowledge area. They provide specialized publications, conferences, business networking, and sometimes other services.

IEEE Computer Society
IEEE Computer Society is the largest among IEEE Societies with 51,985 members as of 2021. Members receive a subscription to its flagship publication, Computer. Non-members and members also receive a free subscription to Computing Edge magazine, which is a digest of content previously published in several IEEE Computer society magazines.

Technical councils
IEEE has seven Technical Councils in broad areas of technology, which sponsor activities that benefit individuals across member Societies.

Other bodies

IEEE Global History Network
In September 2008, the IEEE History Committee founded the IEEE Global History Network, which now redirects to Engineering and Technology History Wiki.

IEEE Foundation
The IEEE Foundation is a charitable foundation established in 1973 to support and promote technology education, innovation, and excellence. It is incorporated separately from the IEEE, although it has a close relationship to it. Members of the Board of Directors of the foundation are required to be active members of IEEE, and one third of them must be current or former members of the IEEE Board of Directors.

Initially, the role of the IEEE Foundation was to accept and administer donations for the IEEE Awards program, but donations increased beyond what was necessary for this purpose, and the scope was broadened. In addition to soliciting and administering unrestricted funds, the foundation also administers donor-designated funds supporting particular educational, humanitarian, historical preservation, and peer recognition programs of the IEEE. As of the end of 2014, the foundation's total assets were nearly $45 million, split equally between unrestricted and donor-designated funds.

Controversies

Huawei ban 
In May 2019, IEEE restricted Huawei employees from peer reviewing papers or handling papers as editors due to the "severe legal implications" of U.S. government sanctions against Huawei. As members of its standard-setting body, Huawei employees could continue to exercise their voting rights, attend standards development meetings, submit proposals and comment in public discussions on new standards. The ban sparked outrage among Chinese scientists on social media. Some professors in China decided to cancel their memberships.

On June 3, 2019, IEEE lifted restrictions on Huawei's editorial and peer review activities after receiving clearance from the United States government.

Position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
On February 26, 2022, the chair of the IEEE Ukraine Section, Ievgen Pichkalov, publicly appealed to the IEEE members to "freeze [IEEE] activities and membership in Russia" and requested "public reaction and strict disapproval of Russia's aggression" from the IEEE and IEEE Region 8. On March 17, 2022, an article in the form of Q&A interview with IEEE Russia (Siberia) senior member Roman Gorbunov titled "A Russian Perspective on the War in Ukraine" was published in IEEE Spectrum to demonstrate "the plurality of views among IEEE members" and the "views that are at odds with international reporting on the war in Ukraine". On March 30, 2022, activist Anna Rohrbach created an open letter to the IEEE in an attempt to have them directly address the article, stating that the article used "common narratives in Russian propaganda" on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and requesting the IEEE Spectrum to acknowledge "that they have unwittingly published a piece furthering misinformation and Russian propaganda." A few days later a note from the editors was added on April 6 with an apology "for not providing adequate context at the time of publication", though the editors did not revise the original article.
Ally McBeal is an American legal comedy drama television series, originally aired on Fox from September 8, 1997, to May 20, 2002. Created by David E. Kelley, the series stars Calista Flockhart in the title role as a lawyer working in the Boston law firm Cage and Fish, with other lawyers whose lives and loves are eccentric, humorous, and dramatic. The series received critical acclaim in its early seasons, winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 1998 and 1999, and also winning the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1999. As of August 2022, a revival is in development at ABC.

Overview
The series, set in the fictional Boston law firm Cage & Fish, begins with main character Allison Marie "Ally" McBeal joining the firm co-owned by her law school classmate Richard Fish (Greg Germann) after leaving her previous job due to sexual harassment. On her first day, Ally is horrified to find that she will be working alongside her ex-boyfriend Billy Thomas (Gil Bellows)—whom she has never gotten over. To make things worse, Billy is now married to fellow lawyer Georgia (Courtney Thorne-Smith), who later joins Cage and Fish. The triangle among the three forms the basis for the main plot for the show's first three seasons.

Although ostensibly a legal drama, the main focus of the series was the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, often using legal proceedings as plot devices to contrast or reinforce a character's drama. For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might provide a backdrop for Ally's decision to break up with a boyfriend. Legal arguments were also frequently used to explore multiple sides of various social issues.

Cage and Fish (which becomes Cage/Fish & McBeal or Cage, Fish, & Associates towards the end of the series), the fictional law firm where most of the characters work, is depicted as a highly sexualized environment symbolized by its unisex restroom. Lawyers and secretaries in the firm routinely date, flirt with, or have a romantic history with one another and frequently run into former or potential romantic interests in the courtroom or on the street outside.

The series had many offbeat and frequently surreal running gags and themes, such as Ally's tendency to immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive, Richard Fish's wattle fetish and humorous mottos ("Fishisms" & "Bygones"), John's gymnastic dismounts out of the office's unisex bathroom stalls, or the dancing twins (played by Eric & Steve Cohen) at the bar, that ran through the series. The show also used vivid, dramatic fantasy sequences for Ally's and other characters' wishful thinking; of particular note is the early internet sensation the dancing baby.

The series also featured regular visits to a local bar where singer Vonda Shepard regularly performed (though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters). Star contemporary singers also performed in the bar at the end of the shows, including acts such as Mariah Carey, Barry White and Anastacia. The series also took place in the same continuity as David E. Kelley's legal drama The Practice (which aired on ABC), as the two shows crossed over with one another on occasion, a rare occurrence for two shows that aired on different networks.

Ultimately, in the last installment of the fifth and final season, "Bygones", Ally decided to resign from Cage & Fish, leave Boston, and go to New York City.

Cancellation
Fox canceled Ally McBeal after five seasons. In addition to being the lowest-rated season of Ally McBeal and the grounds for the show's cancellation, the fifth season was also the only season of the show that failed to win any Emmy or Golden Globe awards.

Cast

Episodes

In Australia, Ally McBeal was aired by the Seven Network from 1997 to 2002. In 2010, it was aired repeatedly by Network 10.

Crossovers with The Practice

Seymore Walsh, a stern judge often exasperated by the eccentricities of the Cage & Fish lawyers and played by actor Albert Hall, was also a recurring character on The Practice. In addition, Judge Jennifer (Whipper) Cone appears on The Practice episode "Line of Duty" (S02 E15), while Judge Roberta Kittelson, a recurring character on The Practice, has a featured guest role in the Ally McBeal episode "Do you Wanna Dance?"

Most of the primary Practice cast members guest starred in the Ally McBeal episode "The Inmates" (S01 E20), in a storyline that concluded with the Practice episode "Axe Murderer" (S02 E26), featuring Calista Flockhart and Gil Bellows reprising their Ally characters. Unusually for a TV crossover, Ally McBeal and The Practice aired on different networks. Bobby Donnell, the main character of The Practice played by Dylan McDermott, was featured heavily in both this crossover and another Ally McBeal episode, "These are the Days".

Regular Practice cast members Lara Flynn Boyle and Michael Badalucco each had a cameo in Ally McBeal (Boyle as a woman who trades insults with Ally in the episode "Making Spirits Bright" and Badalucco as one of Ally's dates in the episode "I Know him by Heart") but it is unclear whether they were playing the same characters they play on The Practice.

In Season 5, Lara Flynn Boyle had an uncredited guest appearance as a rebuttal witness opposite guest star Heather Locklear's character in the episode, "Tom Dooley".

Filming location 
14 Beacon Street in Boston was the exterior which was used as the location for the law firm "Cage & Fish" (later "Cage, Fish, & McBeal"), which was located on the 7th floor of this building.

Reception
Upon premiering in 1997, the show was an instant hit, averaging around 11 million viewers per episode. The show's second season saw an increase in ratings and soon became a top 20 show, averaging around 13 million viewers per episode. The show's ratings began to decline in the third season, but stabilized in the fourth season after Robert Downey Jr. joined the regular cast as Ally's boyfriend Larry Paul, and a fresher aesthetic was created by new art director Matthew DeCoste. However, Downey's character was written out after the end of the season due to the actor's troubles with drug addiction.

The first two seasons, as well as the fourth, remain the most critically acclaimed and saw the most awards success at the Emmys, SAG Awards and the Golden Globes. In 2007, Ally McBeal placed #48 on Entertainment Weekly 2007 "New TV Classics" list.

Ratings

Feminist criticism
Ally McBeal received some criticism from TV critics and feminists who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women (specifically regarding professional women) because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts, and emotional instability. Perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the June 29, 1998, cover story of Time magazine, which juxtaposed McBeal with three pioneering feminists (Susan B. Anthony, Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem) and asked "Is Feminism Dead?" In episode 12 of the second season of the show, Ally talks to her co-worker John Cage about a dream she had, saying "You know, I had a dream that they put my face on the cover of Time magazine as 'the face of feminism'."

Music

Music was a prominent feature of Ally McBeal. Vonda Shepard, a relatively unknown musician at the time, performed regularly on the show and her song "Searchin' My Soul" was the show's theme song. Many of the songs Shepard performed were established hits with lyrics that paralleled the events of each episode, for example, "Both Sides Now", "Hooked on a Feeling" and "Tell Him". Besides recording background music for the show, Shepard frequently appeared at the ends of episodes as a musician performing at a local piano bar frequented by the main characters. On rare occasions, her character would have conventional dialogue. A portion of "Searchin' My Soul" was played at the beginning of each episode, but the song was never played in its entirety.

Several of the characters had a musical leitmotif that played when they appeared. John Cage's was "You're the First, the Last, My Everything", Ling Woo's was the Wicked Witch of the West theme from The Wizard of Oz, and Ally McBeal herself picked "Tell Him", when told by a psychiatrist that she needed a theme song in a Season 1 episode.

Due to the popularity of the show and Shepard's music, a soundtrack titled Songs from Ally McBeal was released in 1998, as well as a successor soundtrack titled Heart and Soul: New Songs from Ally McBeal in 1999. Two compilation albums from the show featuring Shepard were also released in 2000 and 2001. A Christmas album was also released under the title Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas. The album received positive reviews, and Shephard's version of Kay Starr's Christmas song "(Everybody's Waitin' for) The Man with the Bag", received considerable airplay during the holiday season.

Other artists featured on the show include Barry White, Al Green, Gladys Knight, Tina Turner, Macy Gray, Gloria Gaynor, Chayanne, Barry Manilow, Anastacia, Elton John, Sting and Mariah Carey. Josh Groban played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the May 2001 season finale, performing "You're Still You". The series creator, David E. Kelley, was impressed with Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event and based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for him in that finale. The background score for the show was composed by Danny Lux.

Home media
Due to music licensing issues, none of the seasons of Ally McBeal were available on DVD in the United States until 2009, though the show had been available in Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, and the Czech Republic with all the show's music intact since 2005. In the UK, Ireland, and Spain all seasons are available in a complete box set.

20th Century Fox released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 on October 6, 2009. They also released a special complete series edition on the same day. Season 1 does not contain any special features, but the complete series set contains several bonus features, including featurettes, an all-new retrospective, the episode of The Practice in which Calista Flockhart guest-starred, and a bonus disc entitled "The Best of Ally McBeal Soundtrack." In addition, both releases contain all of the original music. Season 2 was released on April 6, 2010. Seasons 3, 4, and 5 were all released on October 5, 2010.

Ally (1999)
In 1999, at the height of the show's popularity, a half-hour version entitled Ally began airing in parallel with the main program. This version, designed in a sitcom format, used re-edited scenes from the main program, along with previously unseen footage. The intention was to further develop the plots in the comedy drama in a sitcom style. It also focused only on Ally's personal life, cutting all the courtroom plots. The repackaged show was cancelled partway through its initial run. While 13 episodes of Ally were produced, only ten aired.

Possible revival
In March 2021, it was reported that a revival as a limited series was in early development by 20th Television with Flockhart possibly returning.

In August 2022, it was reported that ABC was in early development of a sequel series with Karin Gist writing and executive producing.

In popular culture

In episode 2, season 3 of the British comedy The Adam and Joe Show, the show was parodied as "Ally McSqueal" using soft toys.

Episode 12, season 1 of the show Futurama, "When Aliens Attack", centers on an invasion of Earth by the Omicronians precipitated by a signal loss during the climax of an episode of Single Female Lawyer, whose main character is Jenny McNeal.

In episode 8, season 4 of the show The Good Place, the Judge hands Ted Danson's character a petition to reboot Ally McBeal stating "everything else is getting rebooted."

In the 2021 film The Mauritanian, Guantanamo Bay detention camp detainee Mohamedou Ould Salahi says to a US judge "Even in Mauritania, we have watched Law & Order and Ally McBeal."

In episode 3, season 4 of the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, a lyric in the song Dont Be a Lawyer, mentions the show "No one you work with looks like Ally McBeal"

Awards and nominations
Elk Grove Village is a village in Cook and DuPage counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. Per the 2020 census, the population was 32,812. Located  northwest of Chicago along the Golden Corridor, the Village of Elk Grove Village was incorporated on July 17, 1956. It is directly adjacent to O'Hare International Airport and is economically important to the Chicago metropolitan area due to its large industrial park, located on the eastern border of the village. The community is served by several Interstate highways including I-90, I-290/I-355/Route 53, and IL-390. Elk Grove is also expected to be served by the I-490 Western O'Hare Bypass upon completion of the project.

History

Pre-colonial and colonial eras 
The land that is now the Village of Elk Grove was controlled by the Miami Confederacy (which contained the Illini and Kickapoo tribes) starting in the early 1680s. The Confederacy was driven from the area by the Iroquois and Fox in the early 1700s.

The French-allied Potawatomi began to raid and take possession of Northern Illinois in the 1700s. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Potawatomi expanded southwards from their territory in Green Bay and westward from their holdings near Detroit, until they controlled in an L-shaped swath of territory from Green Bay to the Illinois River, and from the Mississippi River to the Maumee River.

In 1833, the Potawatomi signed the 1833 Treaty of Chicago with the United States Government. As a result of the Treaty, the United States was granted control of all land west of Lake Michigan and east of Lake Winnebago in exchange for a tract of land west of the Mississippi. The land that is now Elk Grove was ceded to the U.S. in this treaty, which sparked mass white immigration to the Northern Illinois area. The U.S. Government purchased the land for about 15 cents per acre, and then resold it to white settlers for 1.25 dollars per acre.

Aaron Miner, a revolutionary war veteran, moved to what is now in Elk Grove in 1833. He maintained friendly relations with the remaining Potawatomi, who gave him a firebrand. His wife and daughter often baked cookies which they would trade with the Potawatomi for venison and game.

Incorporation and planned community 
The village was formally incorporated in 1956 in Elk Grove Township, and was founded as a planned suburban community. The majority of houses were constructed by Centex Corporation. As part of the original planning concept, the village was to be home to separated residential and industrial areas (the latter of which would later become the largest industrial park in the United States).

Prior to its development as a residential community, it was home to many farmers and their families (mostly German immigrants). Many of the major streets in and around the village are named for these farmers. Busse Farm was the final undeveloped agricultural property in the village, located between Higgins Road and Oakton Street, and was at one time considered as a location for a new Chicago Bears stadium, to replace the aging Soldier Field. In 2018 the land was sold to be developed into the Elk Grove Technology Park.

The original boundaries of Elk Grove Village's residential area were Higgins Road (Illinois Route 72) on the north, State Road (now Arlington Heights Road) on the west, Landmeier Road on the south, and Wildwood Road on the east. The village easily doubled in size during the 1960s. By the end of the decade, most of the land between O'Hare Airport and I-290/IL-53 was developed. As the village expanded to the south and west, new roads, schools, and parks were added to the community. Rupley Elementary was the first school to be constructed in Elk Grove Village. It was named after Ira Rupley, an executive vice president at Centex who helped lead the early development of the village.

In the 1970s, the village developed land west of the expressway in Schaumburg Township along with industrial development into Addison Township. New apartment communities were constructed in Elk Grove Village along Tonne Road and Ridge Avenue. These developments have since been sectioned, and some converted to condominium homes. The village saw continuous residential, commercial, and industrial growth during the 1980s. However, Lively Junior High School was no longer necessary and saw fast-declining enrollment numbers. It was shut down by the school district, leased to Elk Grove Park District, and remodeled to become the Jack E. Claes Pavilion Recreation Facility. School District 59 built administrative offices at the site.

In 1982, Elk Grove Village was briefly in the national spotlight with one of the first reported deaths in the Chicago Tylenol murders case with the death of 12-year-old Mary Kellerman, who died after taking a Tylenol capsule that was laced with potassium cyanide. The case led to the development of more stringent FDA regulations around tamper-evident technology.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the village embarked on a series of beautification and redevelopment programs which included the installation of a clock tower at Village Hall, installation of brick-paved crosswalks in residential areas, new landscaping in boulevards and other public lands, and installation of retro-themed street lights.

In 2006, Elk Grove Village became one of the first municipalities in Illinois to enact a public smoking ban, and in 2008 became one of the first Chicago suburbs to use red light cameras. In June 2010, Elk Grove Village's Municipal Administration and Public Safety Complex was LEED Gold Certified by the US Green Building Council.

Economy

Elk Grove Village is home to the largest consolidated business park in North America. There are nearly 3,600 businesses operating in the Village's  business park along the western edge of O'Hare International Airport, employing nearly 100,000 persons. In 2018, the business park became the title sponsor of the Bahamas Bowl college football bowl game, making it officially the Makers Wanted Bahamas Bowl after the business park's advertising slogan, "Makers Wanted".

The Elk Grove business park is home to the largest concentration of manufacturers in the Midwest; the largest concentration of logistic freight companies in the United States, and the second-largest source of manufacturing in Illinois behind only the City of Chicago.  The village is home to many large data centers which rely upon the convergence of national fiber optic networks and natural gas lines in Elk Grove, which has other strategic advantages for business including the convergence of national fiber optic cables, national gasoline and oil pipelines, and a virtually unlimited supply of fresh water from Lake Michigan.

Elk Grove Village is home to Alexian Brothers Medical Center (ABMC) hospital, which is the largest employer in the community with over 2,200 workers. There are a number of other well-known corporations including Apple Vacations, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Illinois Tool Works (ITW), ADP, CitiGroup, Norman Distribution, Symons, and Pepsi Cola Distribution.

In 2014, the city launched a new website to serve as an online oasis for all things business related in the city. Current and prospective businesses and real estate professionals can access tools and resources for recruitment resources, work referrals, job requests and more. Those that own or work for a business within Elk Grove qualify for a free membership and profile.

On December 30, 2014, Global Trade Magazine named Elk Grove Village one of America's best cities for global trade.

Elk
As the name suggests, Elk Grove Village is home to a small herd of elk kept in a grove at the eastern edge of the Busse Woods forest preserve for which the grove is named. Elk were originally native to the area (and most of the Eastern United States) but had been extirpated by the early 1800s. The tradition of the Elk Grove herd began when elk were brought by train from Montana by an early resident, William Busse, in the 1920s. The elk are currently maintained by the Chicago Zoological Society veterinary staff and the Busse Woods Forest Preserve wildlife biologists.

OS/390 is an IBM operating system for the System/390 IBM mainframe computers.

Overview
OS/390 was introduced in late 1995 in an effort to simplify the packaging and ordering for the key, entitled elements needed to complete a fully functional MVS operating system package.  These elements included, but were not limited to:

Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem Data Facility Product (DFP)Provides access methods to enable I/O to, e.g., DASD subsystems, printers, Tape; provides utilities and program management
Job Entry Subsystem (JES)Provides the ability to submit batch work and manage print
IBM Communications ServerProvides VTAM and TCP/IP communications protocols

An additional benefit of the OS/390 packaging concept was to improve reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) for the operating system, as the number of different combinations of elements that a customer could order and run was drastically reduced.  This reduced the overall time required for customers to test and deploy the operating system in their environments, as well as reducing the number of customer-reported problems (PMRs), errors (APARs) and fixes (PTFs) arising from the variances in element levels.

In December 2001 IBM extended OS/390 to include support for 64-bit zSeries processors and added various other improvements, and the result is now named z/OS. IBM ended support for the older OS/390-branded versions in late 2004.
Poker is a family of comparing card games in which players wager over which hand is best according to that specific game's rules. It is played worldwide, but in some places the rules may vary. While the earliest known form of the game was played with just 20 cards, today it is usually played with a standard deck, although in countries where short packs are common, it may be played with 32, 40 or 48 cards. Thus poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number dealt face up or face down, and the number shared by all players, but all have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting.

In most modern poker games, the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the blind or ante). In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or "call") the maximum previous bet, or fold, losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also "raise" (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.

With the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability, psychology, and game theory.

Poker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the 20th century and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.

History

While poker's exact origin is the subject of debate, many game scholars point to the French game Poque and the Persian game As-Nas as possible early inspirations. For example, in the 1937 edition of Foster's Complete Hoyle, R. F. Foster wrote that "the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of As-Nas." However, in the 1990s the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas began to be challenged by gaming historians including David Parlett. What is certain, however, is that poker was popularized in the American South in the early 19th century, as gambling riverboats in the Mississippi River and around New Orleans during the 1830s helped spread the game. One early description of poker played on a steamboat in 1829 is recorded by the English actor, Joe Cowell. The game was played with twenty cards ranking from Ace (high) to Ten (low).

In contrast to this version of poker, seven-card stud only appeared in the middle of the 19th century, and was largely spread by the US military. It became a staple in many casinos following the second world war, and grew in popularity with the advent of the World Series of Poker in the 1970s. 

Texas hold 'em and other community card games began to dominate the gambling scenes over the next couple of decades.  The televising of poker was a particularly strong influence increasing the popularity of the game during the turn of the millennium, resulting in the poker boom a few years later between 2003 and 2006.  Today the game has grown to become an extremely popular pastime worldwide.

Gameplay

In casual play, the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a dealer button (or buck). In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table, one at a time.

One or more players are usually required to make forced bets, usually either an ante or a blind bet (sometimes both). The dealer shuffles the cards, the player on the chair to their right cuts, and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to their left. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.

At any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to call (match) the bet, and all opponents instead fold, the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes bluffing possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, distinguishing it from other vying games and from other games that use poker hand rankings.

At the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown, in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts. There are 10 different kinds of poker hands, such as straight flush and four of a kind.

Variants

Poker has many variations, all following a similar pattern of play and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy. There are four main families of variants, largely grouped by the protocol of card-dealing and betting:

Straight A complete hand is dealt to each player, and players bet in one round, with raising and re-raising allowed. This is the oldest poker family; the root of the game as now played was a game known as Primero, which evolved into the game three-card brag, a very popular gentleman's game around the time of the American Revolutionary War and still enjoyed in the U.K. today. Straight hands of five cards are sometimes used as a final showdown, but poker is almost always played in a more complex form to allow for additional strategy.
Stud poker Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or streets, with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, seven-card stud, deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.

Draw poker Five-card draw: A complete hand is dealt to each player, face-down. Then each player must place an ante to the pot. They can then see their cards and bet accordingly. After betting, players can discard up to three cards and take new ones from the top of the deck. Then, another round of betting takes place. Finally, each player must show their cards and the player with the best hand wins.

Community card poker Also known as "flop poker," community card poker is a variation of stud poker.  Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. Texas hold 'em and Omaha are two well-known variants of the community card family.

There are several methods for defining the structure of betting during a hand of poker. The three most common structures are known as "fixed-limit," "pot-limit," and "no-limit." In fixed-limit poker, betting and raising must be done by standardized amounts. For instance, if the required bet is X, an initial bettor may only bet X; if a player wishes to raise a bet, they may only raise by X. In pot-limit poker, a player may bet or raise any amount up to the size of the pot. When calculating the maximum raise allowed, all previous bets and calls, including the intending raiser's call, are first added to the pot. The raiser may then raise the previous bet by the full amount of the pot. In no-limit poker, a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet. In all games, if a player does not have enough betting chips to fully match a bet, they may go "all-in," allowing them to show down their hand for the number of chips they have remaining.

While typical poker games award the pot to the highest hand as per the standard ranking of poker hands, there are variations where the best hand, and thus the hand awarded the pot, is the lowest-ranked hand instead. In such games the best hand contains the lowest cards rather than the highest cards; some variations may be further complicated by whether or not hands such as flushes and straights are considered in the hand rankings. There are also games where the highest and lowest hands divide the pot between them, known as "high low split" games.

Other games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as poker. Video poker is a single-player video game that functions much like a slot machine; most video poker machines play draw poker, where the player bets, a hand is dealt, and the player can discard and replace cards. Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player's initial bet.

Strip poker is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets. Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds, strip poker can be played with any form of poker; however, it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds, like five card draw.

Another game with the poker name, but with a vastly different mode of play, is called Acey-Deucey or Red Dog poker. This game is more similar to Blackjack in its layout and betting; each player bets against the house, and then is dealt two cards. For the player to win, the third card dealt (after an opportunity to raise the bet) must have a value in-between the first two. Payout is based on the odds that this is possible, based on the difference in values of the first two cards. Other poker-like games played at casinos against the house include three card poker and pai gow poker.

Computer programs
A variety of computer poker players have been developed by researchers at the University of Alberta, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Auckland amongst others.

In a January 2015 article published in Science, a group of researchers mostly from the University of Alberta announced that they "essentially weakly solved" heads-up limit Texas Hold 'em with their development of their Cepheus poker bot. The authors claimed that Cepheus would lose at most 0.001 big blinds per game on average against its worst-case opponent, and the strategy is thus so "close to optimal" that "it can't be beaten with statistical significance within a lifetime of human poker playing."

Freudenheim, Pascin (exhibition catalog), University Art Museum, University of California, Berkeley, 1966)</ref> erroneously  or), Jules Pascin''', or the "Prince of Montparnasse", was a Bulgarian artist known for his paintings and drawings. He later became an American citizen. His most frequent subject was women, depicted in casual poses, usually nude or partly dressed.

Pascin was educated in Vienna and Munich. He traveled for a time in the United States, spending most of his time in the South. He is best known as a Parisian painter, who associated with the artistic circles of Montparnasse, and was one of the emigres of the School of Paris. Having struggled with depression and alcoholism, he died by suicide at the age of 45.

 Early life 
Julius Mordecai Pincas was born in Vidin, Bulgaria, the eighth of eleven children, to the Sephardic Jewish family of a grain merchant named Marcus Pincas. Originally from Ruse, the Pincas family was one of the wealthiest in Vidin; they bought and exported wheat, rice, maize and sunflower. His mother, Sofie (Sophie) Pincas, belonged to a Sephardic family, Russo, which had moved from Trieste to Zemun, where she and her husband lived before moving to Vidin and where their older children were born.Sephardic marriages in Vienna: February 1901 — Abraham Alfred Yerocham of Plovdiv (son of Menachem and Sol Yerocham) and Rebecca Pincas of Zemun (daughter of Marcus and Sofie Pincas). The family spoke Judaeo-Spanish at home. In 1892, he moved with his parents to Bucharest, where his father opened a grain company, "Marcus Pincas & Co". Pascin worked briefly for his father's firm at the age of fifteen, but also frequented a local brothel where he made his earliest drawings. His first artistic training was in Vienna in 1902 at age seventeen. In 1903 he relocated to Munich, where he studied at Moritz Heymann's academy. In 1905 he began contributing drawings to Simplicissimus, a satirical magazine published in Munich. Because his father objected to the family name being associated with these drawings, the 20-year-old artist adopted the pseudonym Pascin (an anagram of Pincas). He continued to contribute drawings to a Munich daily until 1929.

In December 1905, Pascin moved to Paris becoming part of the great migration of artists to that city at the start of the 20th century. In 1907 he met Hermine Lionette Cartan David, also a painter, and they became lovers. In that same year he had his first solo exhibition at Paul Cassirer Gallery in Berlin. Despite his social life, Pascin created thousands of watercolors and sketches, plus drawings and caricatures that he sold to various newspapers and magazines. He exhibited his works in commercial galleries and in the Salon d'Automne, the Salon des Indépendants, and the exhibitions of the Berlin Secession and at the Sonderbund-Ausstellung in Cologne. Between 1905 and 1914 he exhibited drawings, watercolors, and prints, but rarely paintings. It was not until about 1907–1909 that he produced his first paintings, which were portraits and nudes in a style influenced by Fauvism and Cézanne. He wanted to become a serious painter, but in time he became deeply depressed over his inability to achieve critical success with his efforts. Dissatisfied with his slow progress in the new medium, he studied the art of drawing at the Académie Colarossi, and painted copies after the masters in the Louvre. He exhibited in the United States for the first time in 1913, when twelve of his works were shown at the Armory Show in New York. 
 
Pascin relocated to London at the outbreak of World War I to avoid service in the Bulgarian army and left for the United States on October 3, 1914. On October 31, Hermine David sailed for the United States to join him.

 United States 

Pascin and David lived in the United States from 1914 to 1920, sitting out World War I. They visited New York City, where David had an exhibit. Pascin frequented nightclubs, and met artists such as Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Guy Pène du Bois, but most of his time in America was spent traveling throughout the South. He also visited Cuba. He made many drawings of street life in Charleston, New Orleans, and other places he visited. Some of his works of 1915 and 1916 are in a Cubist style, which he soon abandoned.

In 1918 Pascin married Hermine David at City Hall in New York City. Their witnesses were Max Weber and Maurice Sterne, friends and painters who both lived in New York. In September 1920, Pascin became a naturalized United States citizen, with support from Alfred Stieglitz and Maurice Sterne, but returned to Paris soon afterward. There he began a relationship with Lucy Vidil Krohg, who had been his lover ten years earlier but had married the Norwegian painter Per Krohg during Pascin's years in America.

Especially after he returned to France, he became the symbol of the Montparnasse artistic community and is more associated with France than the United States. Always in his bowler hat, he was a witty presence, along with his good friend Constant Detré, at Le Dôme Café, Jockey-Club de Paris, and the other haunts of the area's bohemian society. Pascin visited Bulgaria in 1923 and 1924 and at an uncertain later date.

 Career 

Like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pascin drew upon his surroundings and his friends, both male and female, as subjects. During the 1920s, Pascin mostly painted fragile petites filles, prostitutes waiting for clients, or models waiting for the sitting to end. His fleetingly rendered paintings sold readily, but the money he made was quickly spent. Famous as the host of numerous large parties in his flat, whenever he was invited elsewhere for dinner, he arrived with as many bottles of wine as he could carry. He frequently led a large group of friends on summer picnics beside the river Marne, where their excursions lasted all afternoon.

According to his biographer, Georges Charensol:

Scarcely had he chosen his table at the Dôme or the Sélect than he would be surrounded by five or six friends; at nine o'clock, when we got up to dinner, we would be 20 in all, and later in the evening, when we decided to go up to Montmartre to Charlotte Gardelle's or the Princess Marfa's—where Pascin loved to take the place of the drummer in the jazz band—he had to provide for 10 taxis.

Among Pascin's circle of Parisian friends was Ernest Hemingway, whose memoir A Moveable Feast includes a chapter titled "With Pascin At the Dôme", which recounts a night in 1923 when he met Pascin and two of his young models for drinks at the café.

His fellow artist friends and contemporaries included: Chaim Soutine, Isaac Frenkel Frenel, Michel Kikoine and other Jewish artists of the School Of Paris.

 Death 
Pascin struggled with depression and alcoholism.  "[D]riven to the wall by his own legend", according to art critic Gaston Diehl, he died by suicide at the age of 45 on the eve of a prestigious solo show. He slit his wrists and hanged himself in his studio in Montmartre. He left a message written in blood on the wall to his mistress Lucy Krohg. In his last will and testament, Pascin split his estate equally between his wife, Hermine David, and Lucy Krohg.

On the day of Pascin's funeral, June 7, 1930, thousands of acquaintances from the artistic community, and dozens of waiters and bartenders from the restaurants and saloons Pascin had frequented, all dressed in black, walked behind his coffin for three miles, from his studio at 36 boulevard de Clichy to the Cimetière de Saint-Ouen. A year later, Pascin's family had his remains re-interred at the more prestigious cimetière du Montparnasse.

Honours
Pascin Point in Antarctica is named after Jules Pascin.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr.; April 16, 1947) is an American former professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers. During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was a record six-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP). He was a 19-time NBA All-Star—tied for the most ever—a 15-time All-NBA Team member, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team selection. He was a member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, and was twice voted the NBA Finals MVP. He was named to three NBA anniversary teams (35th, 50th, and 75th). Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was called the greatest basketball player of all time by Pat Riley, Isiah Thomas, and Julius Erving. Abdul-Jabbar broke the NBA's career scoring record in 1984 and held it until it was broken in 2023 by LeBron James.

Abdul-Jabbar was known as Lew Alcindor when he played at parochial high school Power Memorial in New York City, where he led their team to 71 consecutive wins. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning three consecutive national championships under head coach John Wooden. Alcindor was a record three-time most outstanding player of the NCAA tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick by the one-season-old Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, he spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After leading the Bucks to its first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark skyhook shot, he established himself as one of the league's top scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the final 14 seasons of his career in which they won five additional NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's contributions were a key component in the Showtime era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his teams succeeded in making the playoffs 18 times and got past the first round 14 times; his teams reached the NBA Finals on ten occasions.

At the time of his retirement at age 42 in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA's all-time leader in points (38,387), games played (1,560), minutes (57,446), field goals made (15,837), field goal attempts (28,307), blocked shots (3,189), defensive rebounds (9,394), and personal fouls (4,657). He remains the all-time leader in minutes played, field goals made, and field goal attempts. He is ranked third all-time in both rebounds and blocked shots. ESPN named him the greatest center of all time in 2007, the greatest player in college basketball history in 2008, and the second best player in NBA history (behind Michael Jordan) in 2016. Abdul-Jabbar has also been an actor, a basketball coach, a best-selling author, and a martial artist, having trained in Jeet Kune Do under Bruce Lee and appeared in his film Game of Death (1972). In 2012, Abdul-Jabbar was selected by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be a U.S. global cultural ambassador. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Early life
Alcindor was born in Harlem, New York City, the only child of Cora Lillian, a department store price checker, and Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Sr., a transit police officer and jazz musician. Cora was born in North Carolina but would end up in Harlem as part of the Great Migration. Ferdinand Sr. was the child of immigrants from Trinidad. Alcindor grew up in the Dyckman Street projects in the Inwood neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, which he moved to at the age of 3 in 1950. At birth, Alcindor weighed  and was  long. He was always very tall for his age. By age nine, he was already  tall. Alcindor was often depressed as a teenager because of the stares and comments about his height. By the eighth grade (age 13–14), he had grown to  and could already slam dunk a basketball.

Alcindor began his record-breaking basketball accomplishments when he was in high school, where he led coach Jack Donohue's Power Memorial Academy team to three straight New York City Catholic championships, a 71–game winning streak, and a 79–2 overall record. This earned him "The Tower from Power" nickname. His 2,067 total points were a New York City high school record. The team won the national high school boys basketball championship when Alcindor was in 10th and 11th grade and was runner-up his senior year. He had a strained relationship in his final year with Donohue after the coach called him a nigger.

Alcindor wrote for the Harlem Youth Action Project newspaper. The Harlem riot of 1964, which was prompted by the fatal shooting of 15-year old black boy James Powell by a New York police officer, triggered Alcindor's interest in racial politics. "Right then and there, I knew who I was, who I had to be. I was going to be black rage personified, Black Power in the flesh", he said.

College career

Alcindor was not able to play professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) out of high school. At the time, the league only accepted players beginning with the year that they could have hypothetically graduated from college. His other options to play basketball professionally would have been to join the Harlem Globetrotters or play overseas. However, Alcindor's goal was to attend college. Recruited by hundreds of schools, he was the most sought-after prospect since Wilt Chamberlain. Southern teams that were segregated were willing to break the color line to acquire Alcindor. He chose to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, after being recruited by Bruins assistant coach Jerry Norman.

By now  tall, Alcindor was relegated to the freshman team in his first year with the Bruins, as freshman were ineligible to play varsity until 1972. The freshman squad included Lucius Allen, Kenny Heitz, and Lynn Shackelford, who were fellow high-school All-Americans. On November 27, 1965, Alcindor made his first public performance in UCLA's annual varsity–freshman exhibition game, attended by 12,051 fans in the inaugural game at the Bruins' new Pauley Pavilion. The 1965–66 varsity team was the two-time defending national champions and the top-ranked team in preseason polls. The freshman team won 75–60 behind Alcindor's 31 points and 21 rebounds. It was the first time a freshman team had beaten the UCLA varsity squad. The varsity had lost Gail Goodrich and Keith Erickson from the championship squad to graduation, and starting guard Freddie Goss was out sick. After the game, UPI wrote: "UCLA's Bruins open defense of their national basketball title this week, but right now they're only the second best team on campus." The freshman team was 21–0 that year, dominating against junior college and other freshman teams.

Alcindor made his varsity debut as a sophomore in 1966 and received national coverage. Sports Illustrated described him as "The New Superstar" after he scored 56 points in his first game, which broke the UCLA single-game record held by Gail Goodrich. He averaged 29 points per game during the season and led UCLA to an undefeated 30–0 record and a national championship, their third title in four years. After the season, the dunk was banned in college basketball in an attempt to curtail his dominance; critics dubbed it the "Alcindor Rule". It was not rescinded until the 1976–77 season. Alcindor was the main contributor to the team's three-year record of 88 wins and only two losses: one to the University of Houston in which Alcindor had an eye injury, and the other to crosstown rival USC who played a "stall game"; there was no shot clock in that era, allowing the Trojans to hold the ball as long as it wanted before attempting to score. They limited Alcindor to only four shots and 10 points.

During his college career, Alcindor was a three-time national player of the year (1967–1969), a three-time unanimous first-team All-American (1967–1969), played on three NCAA basketball champion teams (1967, 1968, and 1969), was honored as the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament three times, and became the first-ever Naismith College Player of the Year in 1969. He was the only player to win the Helms Foundation Player of the Year award three times. He had considered transferring to Michigan because of unfulfilled recruiting promises. UCLA player Willie Naulls introduced Alcindor and teammate Lucius Allen to athletic booster Sam Gilbert, who convinced the pair to remain at UCLA.

During his junior year, Alcindor suffered a scratched left cornea on January 12, 1968, in a game against Cal when he was struck by Tom Henderson in a rebound battle. He would miss the next two games against Stanford and Portland. His cornea would again be scratched during his pro career, which subsequently caused him to wear goggles for eye protection. On January 20, the Bruins faced coach Guy Lewis's Houston Cougars in the first-ever nationally televised regular-season college basketball game, with 52,693 in attendance at the Astrodome. In a contest billed as the "Game of the Century", Cougar forward Elvin Hayes scored 39 points and had 15 rebounds, while Alcindor, suffering from his eye injury, was held to just 15 points as Houston won 71–69, ending UCLA's 47-game winning streak. Hayes and Alcindor had a rematch in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament, where UCLA, with a healthy Alcindor, defeated Houston 101–69 en route to the national championship. UCLA limited Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game, to only ten points. Wooden credited his assistant, Jerry Norman, for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes. Sports Illustrated ran a cover story on the game and used the headline: "Lew's Revenge: The Rout of Houston." As a senior in 1968–69, Alcindor led the Bruins to their third consecutive national title.

During the summer of 1968, Alcindor took the shahada twice and converted to Sunni Islam from Catholicism. He adopted the Arabic name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, though he did not begin using it publicly until 1971. He boycotted the 1968 Summer Olympics, deciding not to try out for U.S. Olympic basketball team, who went on to easily win the gold medal. Alcindor was protesting the unequal treatment of African Americans in the United States, stating that he was "trying to point out to the world the futility of winning the gold medal for this country and then coming back to live under oppression."

As the NBA did not allow college underclassmen to make an early NBA draft declaration, Alcindor completed his studies and earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in history in 1969. In his free time, he practiced martial arts. He studied aikido in New York between his sophomore and junior year before learning Jeet Kune Do under Bruce Lee in Los Angeles.

School records
As of the 2019–20 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team season, he still holds or shares a number of individual records at UCLA:
 Highest career scoring average: 26.4
 Most career field goals: 943 — tied with Don MacLean
 Most points in a season: 870 (1967) 
 Highest season scoring average: 29.0 (1967)
 Most field goals in a season: 346 (1967) — also the second most at 303 (1969) and the third most at 294 (1968)
 Most free throw attempts in a season: 274 (1967)
 Most points in a single game: 61
 Most field goals in a single game: 26 (vs. Washington State, February 25, 1967)

He is represented in the top ten in a number of other school records, including season and career rebounds, second only to Bill Walton.

Professional career

Milwaukee Bucks (1969–1975)

Rookie of the Year (1969–1970)

The Globetrotters offered Alcindor $1 million to play for them, but he declined and was picked first overall in the 1969 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, who were in only their second season of existence. The Bucks had won a coin toss with the Phoenix Suns for the first pick. He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 American Basketball Association draft by the New York Nets. The Nets believed that they had the upper hand in securing Alcindor's services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept only one offer from each team, he rejected the Nets' bid as too low. Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge. After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks' offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying: "A bidding war degrades the people involved. It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't want to think like that."

Alcindor's presence enabled the Bucks to claim second place in the NBA's Eastern Division with a 56–26 record (improved from 27–55 the previous year). On February 21, 1970, he scored 51 points in a 140–127 win over the SuperSonics. Alcindor was an instant star, ranking second in the league in scoring (28.8 ppg) and third in rebounding (14.5 rpg), for which he was awarded the title of NBA Rookie of the Year. In the series-clinching game against the Philadelphia 76ers, he recorded 46 points and 25 rebounds. He was the second rookie to score at least 40 points and 25 rebounds in a playoff game, the first being Wilt Chamberlain. He also set an NBA rookie record with 10 or more games of 20+ points scored during the playoffs, tied by Jayson Tatum in 2018.

First championship, MVP, and Finals MVP (1970–1971)
The next season, the Bucks acquired All-Star guard Oscar Robertson. Milwaukee went on to record the best record in the league with 66 victories in the 1970–71 season, including a then-record 20 straight wins. Alcindor was awarded his first of six NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, along with his first scoring title (31.7 ppg). He also led the league in total points, with 2,596. The Bucks won the NBA title, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. Alcindor posted 27 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in Game 4, and he was named the Finals MVP after averaging 27 points per game on 60.5% shooting in the series.

MVP recognition and trade request (1971–1975)
During the offseason, Alcindor and Robertson joined Bucks head coach Larry Costello on a three-week basketball tour of Africa on behalf of the State Department. In a press conference at the State Department on June 3, 1971, he stated that going forward he wanted to be called by his Muslim name, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, its translation roughly "noble one, servant of the Almighty [i.e., servant of Allah]".

Abdul-Jabbar remained a dominant force for the Bucks. The following year, he repeated as scoring champion (34.8 ppg and 2,822 total points) and became the first player to be named the NBA Most Valuable Player twice in his first three years. In 1974, Abdul-Jabbar led the Bucks to their fourth consecutive Midwest Division title, and he won his third MVP Award in four years. He was among the top five NBA players in scoring (27.0 ppg, third), rebounding (14.5 rpg, fourth), blocked shots (283, second), and field goal percentage (.539, second). Milwaukee advanced to the 1974 finals, losing to the Boston Celtics in seven games.

Robertson, who became a free agent in the offseason, retired in September 1974 after he was unable to agree on a contract with the Bucks.  On October 3, Abdul-Jabbar privately requested a trade to the New York Knicks, with his second choice being the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) and his third, the Los Angeles Lakers. He had never spoken negatively of the city of Milwaukee or its fans, but he said that being in the Midwest did not fit his cultural needs. Two days later in a pre-season game before the 1974–75 season against the Celtics in Buffalo, New York, Abdul-Jabbar caught a fingernail in his left eye from Don Nelson and suffered a corneal abrasion; this angered him enough to punch the backboard stanchion, breaking two bones in his right hand. He missed the first 16 games of the season, during which the Bucks were 3–13, and returned in late November wearing protective goggles. On March 13, 1975, sportscaster Marv Albert reported that Abdul-Jabbar requested a trade to either New York or Los Angeles, preferably to the Knicks. The following day after a loss in Milwaukee to the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar confirmed to reporters his desire to play in another city. He averaged 30.0 points during the season, but Milwaukee finished in last place in the division at 38–44.

Los Angeles Lakers (1975–1989)

Fourth and fifth MVP awards (1975–1977)

In 1975, the Lakers acquired Abdul-Jabbar and reserve center Walt Wesley from the Bucks for center Elmore Smith, guard Brian Winters, blue-chip rookies Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman, and cash. In the 1975–76 season, his first with the Lakers, he had a dominating season, averaging 27.7 points per game and leading the league in rebounding (16.9), blocked shots (4.12), and total minutes played (3,379). His 1,111 defensive rebounds remains the NBA single-season record (defensive rebounds were not recorded prior to the 1973–74 season). He earned his fourth MVP award, becoming the first winner in Lakers' franchise history, but missed the post-season for the second straight year as the Lakers finished 40–42.

After acquiring a cast of no-name free agents, the Lakers were projected to finished near the bottom of the Pacific Division in 1976–77. Abdul-Jabbar helped lead the team to the best record (53–29) in the NBA, and he won his fifth MVP award, tying Bill Russell's record. Abdul-Jabbar led the league in field goal percentage (.579), was third in scoring (26.2), and was second in rebounds (13.3) and blocked shots (3.18). In the playoffs, the Lakers beat the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference semifinals, setting up a confrontation with the Portland Trail Blazers. The result was a memorable matchup, pitting Abdul-Jabbar against a young, injury-free Bill Walton. Although Abdul-Jabbar dominated the series statistically, Walton and the Trail Blazers (who were experiencing their first-ever run in the playoffs) swept the Lakers, behind Walton's skillful passing and timely plays.

Playoff disappointments (1977–1979)
Two minutes into the opening game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar broke his right hand punching Milwaukee's Kent Benson in retaliation to the rookie's elbow to his stomach. Benson suffered a black right eye and required two stitches. According to Benson, Abdul-Jabbar initiated the elbowing, but there were no witnesses and it was not captured on replays. Abdul-Jabbar, who broke the same bone in 1975 after he punched the backboard support, was out for almost two months and missed 20 games. He was fined a then-league record $5,000 but was not suspended. Benson missed one game but was not punished by the league. The Lakers were 8–13 when Abdul-Jabbar returned. He was not named to the 1978 NBA All-Star Game, the only time in his 20-year career he was not selected to an All-Star Game. Chicago's Artis Gilmore and Detroit's Bob Lanier were chosen as reserves for the West, with Walton starting
at center. Amid criticism from the media over his performance, Abdul-Jabbar had 39 points, 20 rebounds, six assists and four blocks in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers the day the All-Star rosters were announced. He added 37 points and 30 rebounds in a victory over the New Jersey Nets (now Brooklyn) in the final game before the All-Star break.

Abdul-Jabbar's play remained strong during the next two seasons, being named to the All-NBA Second Team twice, the All-Defense First Team once, and the All-Defense Second Team once.  The Lakers, however, continued to be stymied in the playoffs, being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in both 1978 (first round) and 1979 (semifinals).

Last MVP award and championship success (1979–1985)

The Lakers selected Magic Johnson with the first overall pick of 1979 NBA draft. They had acquired the pick from the New Orleans Jazz (later Utah) in 1976, when league rules required that they compensate Los Angeles for their signing of free agent Gail Goodrich. The addition of Johnson paved the way for the Lakers' Showtime dynasty of the 1980s, appearing in the finals eight times and winning five NBA championships. While less dominant than in his younger years, Abdul-Jabbar reinforced his status as one of the greatest basketball players ever, adding an additional four All-NBA First Team selections and two All-Defense First Team honors. He won his record sixth MVP award in his first season with Johnson in 1979–80. In the 1980 finals, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 33.4 points in five games, spraining his ankle in Game 5, but returning to  finish the contest with 40 points and leading the team to a win. He missed Game 6, when the Lakers clinched the title, and Johnson was named the Finals MVP after recording 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists in the finale.

Abdul-Jabbar continued to average 20 or more points per game in the following six seasons. The Lakers won another championship in 1981–82, but he suffered migraines in the finals, averaging just 18 points per game against Philadelphia. In 14 playoff games, he finished with a 20.4 point average, the lowest of his career at the time. The Lakers advanced to the 1983 NBA Finals in a rematch against the 76ers, who had acquired Moses Malone to shore up their center position after Abdul-Jabbar had outplayed their big-man duo of Darryl Dawkins and Caldwell Jones in the previous finals. The 76ers swept the Lakers 4–0, and Malone was named the Finals MVP after outrebounding Abdul-Jabbar 72–30 in the series. Malone had 27 offensive rebounds, which nearly equaled Abdul-Jabbar's total rebounds (30). On the road against Utah on April 5, 1984, Abdul-Jabbar broke Chamberlain's record for most career points in the NBA. He received a pass from Johnson and scored from  on his patent skyhook over the  shot-blocking expert Mark Eaton. The game was played at the Thomas & Mack Center, one of 11 home games for the Jazz in the Las Vegas Valley that season.  The contest drew 18,389 fans, the Jazz's largest home crowd since moving from New Orleans before  the 1979–80 season.

Abdul-Jabbar won his second Finals MVP in 1985, when he became the oldest to win the award at 38 years and 54 days old. He averaged 25.7 points, 9 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.5 blocks in the series against Boston. He was initially outplayed in Game 1, scoring 12 points with three rebounds against 30-year-old Celtics center Robert Parish, who had 18 points and eight rebounds in a 148–114 win over the Lakers, dubbed the "Memorial Day Massacre". At the team's film session the following day, Abdul-Jabbar—who normally sat near the back—was seated in the front row, and accepted all of head coach Pat Riley's criticism. Before Game 2, Abdul-Jabbar asked if his father could ride on the team bus to the game.  Typically a hard-liner on rules, Riley agreed to make an exception. Abdul-Jabbar bounced back with 30 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists and three blocks in a 109–102 victory. In the Lakers’ four wins, he averaged 30.2 points, 11.3 rebounds, 6.5 assists and 2.0 blocks. The title ended the Celtics' streak of eight consecutive championships against the Lakers.

Final playing years and sixth ring (1985–1989)
Abdul-Jabbar played in his 17th season in 1985–86, breaking the previous NBA record for seasons played of 16, held by Dolph Schayes, John Havlicek, Paul Silas, and Elvin Hayes. Prior to the 1986–87 season, he gained , reaching close to , to compete against the growing number of 7-footers (2.1 m) in the league. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals in each of his final three seasons, defeating Boston in 1987, and Detroit in 1988. The Lakers lost to the Pistons in a four-game sweep in his final season.  After winning Game 7 of the 1988 finals, the 41-year-old Abdul-Jabbar announced in the locker room that he would return for one more season before retiring. His points, rebounds, and minutes had dropped in his 19th season, and there were reports prior to the game that he was retiring after the contest. On his "retirement tour" he received standing ovations at games, both home and away, and gifts ranging from a yacht that said "Captain Skyhook" to framed jerseys from his career to a Persian rug. At the Forum against Seattle in his final regular season game, every Laker came onto the court wearing Abdul-Jabbar's trademark goggles.

At the time of his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar held the record for most career games played in the NBA. He was also the all-time record holder for most field goals made (15,837) and most minutes played (57,446), as well as most points (38,387) until LeBron James broke the record in 2023.

Coaching career
In 1995, Abdul-Jabbar began expressing an interest in coaching and imparting knowledge from his playing days. His opportunities were limited despite the success he enjoyed during his playing days. During his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation for being introverted and sullen. He was often unfriendly with the media. His sensitivity and shyness created a perception of him being aloof and surly. At the time, his mentality was that he either did not have the time or did not owe anything to anyone. Magic Johnson recalled as a kid being brushed off after asking him for an autograph. Abdul-Jabbar might freeze out a reporter if they touched him, and he once refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview.

Abdul-Jabbar had spent most of his career with a reserved attitude towards media attention (since he did not have to deal with it as a star at UCLA) before he softened up near the end of his career. Abdul-Jabbar said: "I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it." However, he believes it was his reputation as a "difficult person", alongside his attempts at trying to break into coaching while nearing the age of fifty, that affected his chances of becoming a head coach within the NBA or NCAA.

Abdul-Jabbar worked as an assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers and the Seattle SuperSonics, helping mentor, among others, their young centers, Michael Olowokandi and Jerome James. Abdul-Jabbar was the head coach of the Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League in 2002, leading the team to the league's championship that season, but he failed to land the head coaching position at Columbia University a year later. He then worked as a scout for the New York Knicks. He returned to the Lakers as a special assistant coach to Phil Jackson for six seasons (2005–2011). Early on, he mentored their young center, Andrew Bynum. Abdul-Jabbar also served as a volunteer coach at Alchesay High School on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in Whiteriver, Arizona, in 1998. He moved on from coaching in 2013 after unsuccessfully lobbying for open head coach positions with UCLA and the Milwaukee Bucks.

Player profile
On offense, Abdul-Jabbar was a dominant low-post threat. In contrast to other low-post specialists like Wilt Chamberlain or Shaquille O'Neal, he was a slender giant, standing  tall while weighing around  to , although he bulked to  in 1986; in his early years, he used that frame for agility and speed while in later years he utilized a bigger frame for trying to guard under the basket. Abdul-Jabbar was famous for his ambidextrous skyhook shot. It contributed to his high .5595 field goal accuracy, making him the 21st most accurate scorer of all time, as well as a feared clutch shooter. He shot above 50% in every season but his last.

Abdul-Jabbar maintained a dominant presence on defense. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Team eleven times. He frustrated opponents with his superior shot-blocking ability and denied an average of 2.6 shots a game. He was not an aggressive rebounder, relying more on his size as a 7-footer instead of positioning. After the pounding he endured early in his career, his rebounding average fell to between six or eight a game in his latter years. As a teammate, Abdul-Jabbar exuded natural leadership and was affectionately called "Cap", or "Captain", by his colleagues. He had an even temperament, which Riley said made him coachable.

A strict fitness regime made Abdul-Jabbar one of the most durable players of all time. He began a year-around conditioning program at age 26. While in Los Angeles, Abdul-Jabbar started doing yoga in 1976 to improve his flexibility, and was notable for his physical fitness regimen. He said: "There is no way I could have played as long as I did without yoga." Because of his metabolism, he had difficulty putting on weight. Prior to the 1979–80 season, he gained  from 240 to  after switching from free weights to Nauitilus equipment. He also switched that offseason from tai chi to yoga. To reduce wear during his later years, Riley did not have him inbound the ball on made baskets, and had him wait at the opposite end of the court on free throws. In what he described as playing a "smarter game" to conserve energy, Abdul-Jabbar sometimes would be the last player to set up on offense by several seconds after staying behind on defense to see if the Lakers scored on a fast break. In 1981, he responded to criticism that he did not hustle: "You have to understand I have to play 42 to 45 minutes a night, and it's like mowing a huge estate lawn. If you rush out and run around furiously, it's self-defeating. You'll be worn out just at the point when you're most needed." Addul-Jabbar finished his career with then-NBA records of 20 seasons and 1,560 games played, later broken by former Celtics center Robert Parish.

Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his trademark goggles after getting poked in the eye during preseason in 1975. He continued wearing them for years until abandoning them in the 1979 playoffs. He resumed wearing goggles in October 1980 after being accidentally poked in the right eye by Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich.  After years of being jabbed in the eyes, Abdul-Jabbar developed corneal erosion syndrome, occasionally experiencing pain when his eyes dry up. He missed three games in December 1986 due to the condition.

Skyhook
Abdul-Jabbar was well known for his trademark skyhook, a hook shot in which he raised the ball and released it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. He could shoot the skyhook from up to . With his long arms and great height, he released the ball so high that it was difficult for a defender to block without committing a goaltending violation. His body being between the defender and the ball made it further difficult to block, as did extending his non-shooting arm to fend off opponents. He was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left, which he developed in his later years.

According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the ambidextrious Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was "the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed back in my face". He also watched Cliff Hagan shoot the hook with the St. Louis Hawks. To prevent his hook from being blocked from behind, he was advised by Wooden to do away with the typical sweeping motion of a hook shot, instead keeping the ball close to his body and shooting with a straighter motion. Addul-Jabbar's hook shot improved in his junior year at UCLA, after the dunk was banned. In his final college years, he often released the ball several feet above the rim.

Legacy
Abdul-Jabbar won a record six MVP awards. His 38,387 career points remained the NBA's career scoring record until February 7, 2023, when he was surpassed by LeBron James of the Lakers in Los Angeles.  Abdul-Jabbar attended the game, and passed the game ball to James during the in-game ceremony after the record was broken. James did not play college ball, entering the league straight out of high school at age 18 in 2003. Abdul-Jabbar held the scoring mark for nearly 39 years, the longest span in league history. His skyhook is considered one of the most unstoppable shots ever. He won six NBA championships and two Finals MVP awards, was voted to 15 All-NBA and 11 All-Defensive Teams, and was selected to a record 19 All-Star teams, tied by James in 2023. He was named to the NBA's 35th, 50th, and 75th anniversary teams. He averaged 24.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 2.6 blocks per game. Abdul-Jabbar is ranked as the NBA's third leading all-time rebounder (17,440). He is the third all-time in registered blocks (3,189), which is impressive because this basketball statistic was not recorded until the fourth year of his career (1974). He had three straight seasons where he averaged at least 30 points and 16 rebounds, and six times he averaged at least 27 points and 14.5 rebounds in the same season.

Abdul-Jabbar combined dominance during his career peak with the longevity and sustained excellence of his later years. A pioneer in using yoga in the NBA, he also credited Bruce Lee with teaching him "the discipline and spirituality of martial arts, which was greatly responsible for me being able to play competitively in the NBA for 20 years with very few injuries". Abdul-Jabbar played in 95 percent of his team's regular-season games during his career, including 80 or more games in 11 of his 20 seasons. Five times he played in all 82 games. After claiming his sixth and final MVP in 1980, he continued to average above 20 points in the following six seasons, including 23 points per game in his 17th season at age 38. He earned first-team All-NBA selections that were 15 years apart and Finals MVPs 14 seasons from each other.

Among the most graceful basketball players ever, Abdul-Jabbar is regarded as one of the best centers ever and one of the greatest players in NBA history; he was voted the best center of all time by ESPN ahead of Wilt Chamberlain in 2007, and ranked  4 in Slams "Top 100 Players Of All-Time" in 2018, and No. 3 in ESPN's list of the top 74 NBA players of all time in 2020, the best center ever ahead of Bill Russell and Chamberlain. League experts and basketball legends frequently mentioned him when considering the greatest player of all time. Riley said in 1985: "Why judge anymore? When a man has broken records, won championships, endured tremendous criticism and responsibility, why judge? Let's toast him as the greatest player ever." In 2023, as James was on the verge of breaking the NBA career scoring record, Abdul-Jabbar remained as Riley's choice as the greatest: "We don't win championships without the greatest player in the history of the game, who had the greatest weapon in the history of the game. The skyhook was unstoppable. Last minute of the game, it's going to one guy".  As president of the Miami Heat, Riley had won two NBA titles with James on their roster. Isiah Thomas remarked: "If they say the numbers don't lie, then Kareem is the greatest ever to play the game." In 2013, Julius Erving  said: "In terms of players all-time, Kareem is still the number one guy. He's the guy you gotta start your franchise with." In 2015, ESPN named Abdul-Jabbar the best center in NBA history, and ranked him No. 2 behind Michael Jordan among the greatest NBA players ever. While Jordan's shots were enthralling and considered unfathomable, Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook appeared automatic, and he himself called the shot "unsexy". In 2016, Abdul-Jabbar's only recognized rookie card became the most expensive basketball card ever sold (the record has since been surpassed) when it went for $501,900 at auction. In 2022, he was ranked No. 3 (first in his position) in ESPN's NBA 75th Anniversary Team list, and No. 3 (behind Jordan and James) in a similar list by The Athletic.

Film and television

Playing in Los Angeles facilitated Abdul-Jabbar's trying his hand at acting. He made his film debut in Bruce Lee's 1972 film Game of Death, in which his character Hakim fights Billy Lo (played by Lee).

In 1980, Abdul-Jabbar played co-pilot Roger Murdock in Airplane! He has a scene in which a little boy looks at him and remarks that he is in fact Abdul-Jabbar, spoofing the appearance of football star Elroy "Crazylegs" Hirsch as an airplane pilot in the 1957 drama that served as the inspiration for Airplane!, Zero Hour! Staying in character, Abdul-Jabbar states that he is merely Roger Murdock, an airline co-pilot; the boy continues to insist that Abdul-Jabbar is "the greatest", but that according to his father he does not "work hard on defense" and that he does not "really try, except during the playoffs". This causes Abdul-Jabbar's character to snap: "The hell I don't!" He then grabs the boy and snarls that he has "been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA" and been "busting my buns every night!" He instructs the boy: "Tell your old man to drag [Bill] Walton and [Bob] Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes." When Murdock loses consciousness later in the film, he collapses at the controls wearing Abdul-Jabbar's goggles and yellow Lakers' shorts. In 2014, Abdul-Jabbar and  Airplane! co-star Robert Hays (character Ted Striker) reprised their Airplane! roles in a parody commercial promoting Wisconsin tourism.

Abdul-Jabbar has had numerous other television and film appearances, often playing himself. He has had roles in movies such as Fletch, Troop Beverly Hills and Forget Paris, and television series such as Full House, Living Single, Amen, Everybody Loves Raymond, Martin, Diff'rent Strokes (his height humorously contrasted with that of diminutive child star Gary Coleman), The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Scrubs, 21 Jump Street, Emergency!, Man from Atlantis, and New Girl. Abdul-Jabbar played a genie in a lamp in a 1984 episode of Tales from the Darkside. He also played himself on the February 10, 1994, episode of the sketch comedy television series In Living Color.

Abdul-Jabbar appeared in the television version of Stephen King's The Stand, played the Archangel of Basketball in Slam Dunk Ernest, and had a brief non-speaking cameo appearance in BASEketball. Abdul-Jabbar was also the co-executive producer of the 1994 TV film The Vernon Johns Story. He has also made appearances on The Colbert Report in a 2006 skit called "HipHopKetball II: The ReJazzebration Remix '06", and in 2008 as a stage manager who is sent out on a mission to find Nazi gold. Abdul-Jabbar also voiced himself in a 2011 episode of The Simpsons titled "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing". He had a recurring role as himself on the NBC series Guys with Kids, which aired from 2012 to 2013. On Al Jazeera English he expressed his desire to be remembered not just as a player, but also as somebody who used their mind and made other contributions.

In February 2019, he appeared in season 12 episode 16 of The Big Bang Theory, "The D&D Vortex". In 2021, Abdul-Jabbar made a guest appearance as himself in a season 2 episode of Dave. The episode he appeared in was also named after him. Abdul-Jabbar makes a cameo appearance as himself in the 2022 Netflix film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.

Writing
In September 2018, Abdul-Jabbar was announced as one of the writers for the July 2019 revival of Veronica Mars.

Documentaries
On February 10, 2011, Abdul-Jabbar debuted his film On the Shoulders of Giants, documenting the tumultuous journey of the famed yet often-overlooked New York Renaissance professional basketball team, at Science Park High School in Newark, New Jersey. The event was simulcast live throughout the school, city, and state. In 2015, he appeared in Kareem: Minority of One, an HBO documentary on his life. In 2020, Abdul-Jabbar was the executive producer and narrator of the History channel special Black Patriots: Heroes of the Revolution. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his narration.

Reality television
Abdul-Jabbar participated in the 2013 ABC reality series Splash, a celebrity diving competition. In April 2018, Abdul-Jabbar competed in the all-athlete season of season 26 of Dancing with the Stars and partnered with professional dancer Lindsay Arnold.

Writing and activism

In 1967, Abdul-Jabbar was the only college athlete to attend the Cleveland Summit, a meeting of prominent black athletes who convened in support of Muhammad Ali's refusal to fight in the Vietnam War. The following year, Abdul-Jabbar boycotted the Summer Olympics to protest American racism, drawing death threats for his decision.

Abdul-Jabbar became a best-selling author and cultural critic. He published several books, mostly on African-American history. His first book, his autobiography Giant Steps, was written in 1983 with co-author Peter Knobler. The book's title is an homage to jazz great John Coltrane, referring to his album Giant Steps. Others include On the Shoulders of Giants: My Journey Through the Harlem Renaissance, co-written with Raymond Obstfeld, and Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, World War II's Forgotten Heroes, co-written with Anthony Walton, which is a history of the first black armored unit to fight in World War II.

A regular contributor to discussions about issues of race and religion, among other topics, in national magazines and on television, Abdul-Jabbar has written a regular column for Time. He appeared on Meet the Press on January 25, 2015, to talk about a column saying that Islam should not be blamed for the actions of violent extremists, just as Christianity has not been blamed for the actions of violent extremists who profess Christianity. When asked about being Muslim, he said: "I don't have any misgiving about my faith. I'm very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world. That is not what Islam is about, and that should not be what people think of when they think about Muslims. But it's up to all of us to do something about all of it."

In November 2014, Abdul-Jabbar published an essay in Jacobin calling for just compensation for college athletes, writing that "in the name of fairness, we must bring an end to the indentured servitude of college athletes and start paying them what they are worth." Commenting on Donald Trump's 2017 travel ban, he condemned it, saying: "The absence of reason and compassion is the very definition of pure evil because it is a rejection of our sacred values, distilled from millennia of struggle."

Government appointments

Cultural ambassador

In January 2012, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that Abdul-Jabbar had accepted a position as a cultural ambassador for the United States. During the announcement press conference, Abdul-Jabbar commented on the historical legacy of African-Americans as representatives of U.S. culture: "I remember when Louis Armstrong first did it back for President Kennedy, one of my heroes. So it's nice to be following in his footsteps." As part of this role, Abdul-Jabbar has traveled to Brazil to promote education for local youths.

President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition
Former President Barack Obama announced in his last days of office that he has appointed Abdul-Jabbar along with Gabrielle Douglas and Carli Lloyd to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition.

Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee
In January 2017, Abdul-Jabbar was appointed to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee by United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. According to the United States Mint, Abdul-Jabbar is a keen coin collector whose interest in the life of Alexander Hamilton had led him into the hobby. He resigned in 2018 due to what the Mint described as "increasing personal obligations".

Personal life

Abdul-Jabbar met Habiba Abdul-Jabbar (born Janice Brown) at a Lakers game during his senior year at UCLA. They eventually married and together had three children: daughters Habiba and Sultana and son Kareem Jr., who played basketball at Western Kentucky after attending Valparaiso. Abdul-Jabbar and Janice divorced in 1978. He has another son, Amir, with Cheryl Pistono. Another son, Adam, made an appearance on the TV sitcom Full House with him.

In 1983, Abdul-Jabbar's house burned down. Many of his belongings, including his beloved jazz LP collection of about 3,000 albums, were destroyed. Many Lakers fans sent and brought him albums, which he found uplifting.

In 2016, Abdul-Jabbar performed a tribute to friend Muhammad Ali along with Chance the Rapper.

Religion and name
At age 24 in 1971, he converted to Islam and legally became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which means "noble one, servant of the Almighty." He was named by Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. Abdul-Jabbar purchased and donated 7700 16th Street NW, a house in Washington, D.C., for Khaalis to use as the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center; a few years later, the location would become the place of the 1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre. Eventually, Kareem "found that [he] disagreed with some of Hamaas' teachings about the Quran, and [they] parted ways." He then studied the Quran on his own, and "emerged from this pilgrimage with [his] beliefs clarified and [his] faith renewed." Abdul-Jabbar was also heavily influenced by Malcolm X, a leader of the Nation of Islam. Abdul-Jabbar was invited to join the group, but he refused.

Abdul-Jabbar has spoken about the thinking that was behind his name change when he converted to Islam. He stated that he was "latching on to something that was part of my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery ... My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted." His name change further eroded his public image in the United States, mostly in white areas.

In 1998, Abdul-Jabbar reached a settlement after he sued Miami Dolphins running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar (now Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar, born Sharmon Shah) because he felt Karim was profiting off the name he made famous by having the Abdul-Jabbar moniker and number 33 on his Dolphins jersey. As a result, the younger Abdul-Jabbar had to change his jersey nameplate to "Abdul" while playing for the Dolphins. The football player had also been an athlete at UCLA.

Health problems
Abdul-Jabbar suffers from migraines, and his use of cannabis to reduce the symptoms has had legal ramifications. In November 2009, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he was suffering from a form of leukemia, Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The disease was diagnosed in December 2008, but Abdul-Jabbar said his condition could be managed by taking oral medication daily, seeing his specialist every other month, and having his blood analyzed regularly. He expressed in a 2009 press conference that he did not believe the illness would stop him from leading a normal life. Abdul-Jabbar is a spokesman for Novartis, the company that produces Gleevec, his cancer medication.

In February 2011, Abdul-Jabbar announced via Twitter that his leukemia was gone and he was "100% cancer free". A few days later, he clarified his misstatement: "You're never really cancer-free and I should have known that. My cancer right now is at an absolute minimum." In April 2015, Abdul-Jabbar was admitted to hospital when he was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Later that week, on his 68th birthday, he underwent quadruple coronary bypass surgery at the UCLA Medical Center.

In February 2023 he spoke out about his atrial fibrillation diagnosis.  He partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer's "No Time to Wait" to raise awareness of the symptoms of the irregular and rapid heart rhythm condition which increase the risk of stroke.

Non-athletic honors
In 2011, Abdul-Jabbar was awarded the Double Helix Medal for his work in raising awareness for cancer research. Also in 2011, Abdul-Jabbar received an honorary degree from New York Institute of Technology. In 2016, Abdul-Jabbar was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2020, Abdul-Jabbar was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator for his work on the documentary special Black Patriots: Heroes of The Revolution.

Elizabeth R. Schwartz (née Robinson; August 23, 1911 – May 18, 1999) was an American athlete and winner of the first Olympic 100 metres for women.

Early life
Robinson was born in Riverdale, Illinois. She was a student at Thornton Township High School when she achieved national acclaim as an Olympic champion. 

Her talent was discovered by her science teacher Charles Price, who saw her running to catch the train after school. He was a former athlete and the coach of the school team.

Athletics
Robinson ran her first official race on March 30, 1928, at the age of 16, at an indoor meet where she finished second to Helen Filkey, the US record holder at 100 m, in the 60-yard dash. At her next race on June 2, outdoors at 100 meters, she beat Filkey and equalled the world record, though her time was not recognized because it was deemed wind-aided.

At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, her third 100 m competition, Robinson was the only US athlete to qualify for the 100 m final. She reached the final and won, equaling the world record of 12.2 seconds. She was the inaugural Olympic champion in the event, since athletics for women had not been on the program before, and its inclusion was in fact still heavily disputed among officials. She remains the youngest athlete to win Olympic 100 m gold. With the American 4×100 metres relay team, Robinson added a silver medal to her record.

Six decades later, Robinson was interviewed for a book, Tales of Glory: An Oral History of the Summer Olympic Games Told By America’s Gold Medal Winners, by Lewis H. Carlson and John J Fogarty. This is how she remembered the 100 m race:I can remember breaking the tape, but I wasn’t sure that I’d won. It was so close. But my friends in the stands jumped over the railing and came down and put their arms around me, and then I knew I’d won. Then, when they raised the flag, I cried.
In a post-match video, Robinson smiled, bewildered, at the camera, then smiled again with an open, unsophisticated smile of teenage delight, an embarrassment that often accompanies such interest. She was a star. Chicago Tribune reporter William L Shirer wrote that ‘an unheralded, pretty, blue-eyed blond young woman from Chicago became the darling of the spectators when she flew down the cinder path, her golden locks flying, to win’. 

She joined Northwestern University where she decided to pursue a physical education degree, hoping to become a coach at the 1936 Olympics. At Northwestern, she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

On 28 June 1931, Robinson was involved in a plane crash and was severely injured. Initial reports had her being discovered unconscious in the wreckage, wrongly thought dead by her rescuer. Actually, the man merely thought she was beyond saving. He took her to Oak Forest infirmary, locally known as the "Poor Farm", because he knew the undertaker. Doctors determined she had suffered severe multiple injuries and she would never race again. It was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair, and two years before she could walk normally again. Meanwhile, she missed the 1932 Summer Olympics in her home country.

Still unable to kneel for a normal 100 m start due to the fractures and surgeries on her left leg, Robinson was a part of the US team of 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The US team was running behind the heavily favored Germans, but the Germans dropped their baton. Robinson took the lead and handed off the baton to Helen Stephens, resulting in her second Olympic gold medal.

After athletic career
Retiring after the Berlin Olympics, Robinson remained involved in athletics as an official. She worked in a hardware store for many years. In 1977, she was inducted into the USA National Track and Field Hall of Fame. In 1996, she carried the Olympic Torch for the Atlanta Olympic Games.

Personal life
She married and had two children. The family resided in Glencoe, Illinois, a suburb on Chicago’s North Shore. 

She died at age 87, suffering from cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
Russenorsk  (English: Russo-Norwegian) is an extinct dual-source "restricted pidgin" language formerly used in the Arctic, which combined elements of Russian and Norwegian. Russenorsk originated from Russian traders and Norwegian fishermen from Tromsø (northern Norway) and Kola (north-western Russia). It was used extensively in Northern Norway for about 150 years in the Pomor trade. Russenorsk is important as a test case for theories concerning pidgin languages since it was used far away from most of the other documented pidgins of the world.

As is common in the development of pidgins and trade languages, the interaction of  fishermen and traders with no common language necessitated the creation of some minimal form of communication. Like all pidgins, Russenorsk had a rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary, mostly composed of words essential to Arctic fishing and trade (fish, weather, etc.); however, Russenorsk was used outside of fishing and trade context during the off-season as it was not uncommon for Russians to remain in Norway during the winter.

History
Barter existed between Russians and Norwegians for 150 years in Troms and Finnmark counties. This barter was supported by the Norwegian government, and King Christian VII conferred city status to several settlements, such as Tromsø, to facilitate it. Norwegians mainly traded fish for flour and wheat from Russians. The trading went on throughout the sunny months of the year and was beneficial to both sides; Norwegians had access to cheap fish in the summer, whilst Russians had surplus wheat. Traders came from the areas near Murmansk and the White Sea, most often to Vardø, Hammerfest, and Tromsø, occasionally further south to the Lofoten islands.

The earliest recorded instance of Russenorsk was in 1785. It is one of the most studied northern pidgins; many linguists, for example, Olaf Broch, studied it. Unlike equatorial pidgins, it was formed from only two languages, Norwegian and Russian. Furthermore, these languages are not from the same branch of Indo-European languages. Also unlike equatorial pidgins, Russenorsk was formed from one social class.

Until 1850, Russenorsk was socially acceptable for all social classes. In 1850, Russenorsk became more limited to Norwegian fishermen, whereas Norwegian traders learnt Russian through exposure in Archangelsk and Russian trade centers, often formally studying the language to the extent that they could communicate in rudimentary Russian. This increase in Russian study caused the devaluation of Russenorsk in terms of social status.

In 1917, Finland's declaration of independence from Russia caused the Russian–Norwegian border to decrease significantly. In 1919, the border disappeared completely. Furthermore, the Soviet Union limited international contact significantly, decreasing the need for the common language between Norwegians and Russians. The last such Norwegian–Russian trade occurred in 1923.

Phonology
Russenorsk uses many of the phonemes common to both Norwegian and Russian, altering phonemes only used in one. Pronunciation was depended on the language background of the speaker.
, absent in Norwegian, became :  ('how many?') → .
, absent in Norwegian, became :  ('good') → .
, absent in Russian, became :  ('half') → .
final voiced consonants, absent in Russian, became unvoiced:  ('sea') → 

More is known about the Norwegian variety of Russenorsk due to the fact that most of the texts in Russenorsk were written by Norwegians. In the few Russian records of the language, there are examples of both  and  in the words  ('to give') and  ('captain'), for which the Norwegians used . The Russian affricate  in words such as  ('tea') was substituted by the Norwegians with the fricative .

Vocabulary
Corpora of Russenorsk consist of lists of individual words and phrases as well as records of dialogues compiled by linguists such as Just Knud Qvigstad. The corpora include c. 400 words, about half of those only appear once in the records (so-called hapax legomena), therefore, the vocabulary contained only 150–200 core words.

The origin of its vocabulary is generally held to be approximately 40% Russian and 50% Norwegian, with the remaining 10% from Dutch, Low German, French, English, Sami, and Swedish. 

Many words in Russenorsk have a synonym from the other primary language.
,  (halibut)
,  (man)
,  (this)
,  (not)
Some words can be etymologically traced to both Norwegian and Russian, for example,  (Norwegian) and  (Russian). Some words have an unclear etymology; for example,  or  can come from Russian, Swedish, or Finnish.

Some Russenorsk words survive in the dialect of Vardø:
 (Russenorsk: , , 'to steal')
 ('bread')

Grammar
One of the characteristics differentiating the pidgin from jargon is its grammar; however, Russenorsk did not go through tertiary hybridization. Russenorsk is mainly influenced by Norwegian grammar, leading some to conclude that it is a variant of Norwegian with some Russian influence.

A lack of metalinguistic awareness amongst Russenorsk speakers may have led them to believe they were speaking the language of their interlocutor; that is, that Russians believed they were speaking Norwegian and vice versa.

There are no clear verb conjugations. The main indication of a verb is the suffix , for example,  (the captain is asleep in his cabin). Nominative nouns usually end with . Conjunctions used to make compound sentences or dependent clauses are , , and .  is used as an interrogative word. The general word order is SVO, with some alterations for questions and sentences with adverbs.

 is used as the only preposition for the oblique case:
For possession:  ('your watch')
For location:  ('little money in the pocket'), and  ('Is the captain aboard the ship?')
For temporal relation:  ('tomorrow'),  ('last year').
For direction:  ('I will throw you in the water'),  ('How many days did you travel from here [to get] to Arkhangelsk?'),  ('go to Arkhangelsk').

Morphology
Russenorsk does not have extensive morphology, but has some unique characteristics. The ending  does not come from Russian nor Norwegian, but it may come from Solombala English. The ending , from Norwegian, is used to indicate nationality or profession, for example  ('Russian'),  ('Norwegian'), or  ('trader'). Other morphological features are reduplication, such as  ('after tomorrow'), and compounding, such as  ('cow') and  ('shirt') to  ('cowhide').

Syntax
One characteristic syntactical attribute of Russenorsk is the tendency to move the verb to the final position when the sentence has adverbs. This is found in neither Russian nor Norwegian. Another is that the negator precedes the verb, but can be separated from the verb. This is unlike negation in either Russian or Norwegian, but it may have come from Finnish, in which this syntax was probable. Moreover, the use of barter-focused language established frequent use of interrogative speech in sentences.

Examples
 marks Russian origin,  marks Norwegian.

Nicholas Vachel Lindsay (November 10, 1879 – December 5, 1931) was an American poet. He is considered a founder of modern singing poetry, as he referred to it, in which verses are meant to be sung or chanted.

Early years
Lindsay was born in Springfield, Illinois where his father, Vachel Thomas Lindsay, worked as a medical doctor and had amassed considerable wealth. The Lindsays lived across the street from the Illinois Executive Mansion, home of the Governor of Illinois. The location of his childhood home influenced Lindsay, and one of his poems, "The Eagle Forgotten", eulogizes Illinois governor John P. Altgeld, whom Lindsay admired for his courage in pardoning the anarchists involved in the Haymarket Affair, despite the strong protests of US President Grover Cleveland.

Growing up in Springfield influenced Lindsay in other ways, as evidenced in such poems as "On the Building of Springfield" and culminating in poems praising Springfield's most famous resident, Abraham Lincoln. In "Lincoln", Lindsay exclaims, "Would I might rouse the Lincoln in you all!" This line was later adopted as the official motto of the Association of Lincoln Presenters. In his 1914 poem "Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight (In Springfield, Illinois)", Lindsay specifically places Lincoln in Springfield, with the poem's opening:

It is portentous, and a thing of state
That here at midnight, in our little town
A mourning figure walks, and will not rest...

Lindsay studied medicine at Ohio's Hiram College from 1897 to 1900, but he did not want to be a doctor; his parents were pressuring him toward medicine. Once he wrote to them that he wasn't meant to be a doctor but a painter; they wrote back saying that doctors can draw pictures in their free time. He left Hiram anyway, heading to Chicago to study at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1900 to 1903. In 1904 he left to attend the New York School of Art (now The New School) to study pen and ink. Lindsay remained interested in art for the rest of his life, drawing illustrations for some of his poetry. His art studies also probably led him to appreciate the new art form of silent film. His 1915 book The Art of the Moving Picture is generally considered the first book of film criticism, according to critic Stanley Kauffmann, discussing Lindsay in For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism.

Beginnings as a poet

While in New York in 1905 Lindsay turned to poetry in earnest. He tried to sell his poems on the streets. Self-printing his poems, he began to barter a pamphlet titled Rhymes To Be Traded For Bread, which he traded for food as a self-perceived modern version of a medieval troubadour.

From March to May, 1906, Lindsay traveled roughly 600 miles on foot from Jacksonville, Florida, to Kentucky, again trading his poetry for food and lodging. From April to May, 1908, Lindsay undertook another poetry-selling trek, walking from New York City to Hiram, Ohio.

From May to September 1912 he traveled—again on foot—from Illinois to New Mexico, trading his poems for food and lodging. During this last trek, Lindsay composed his most famous poem, "The Congo". Going through Kansas, he was supposedly so successful that "he had to send money home to keep his pockets empty".  On his return, Harriet Monroe published in Poetry magazine first his poem "General William Booth Enters into Heaven" in 1913 and then "The Congo" in 1914. At this point, Lindsay became very well known.

Poetry as performance

Unlike Lindsay's more purely intellectual contemporaries, the poet declaimed his works from the stage, complete with the extravagant gestures of a carnival barker and old time preacher, from the beginning declaring himself to be a product of what he termed  'Higher Vaudeville':
"I think that my first poetic impulse is for music; second a definite conception with the ring of the universe..." (Vachel Lindsay, Edgar Lee Masters 1935, page 62) This is evidenced by the 1931 recording he made just before his suicide, his still-radical performances of 'The Mysterious Cat', 'The Flower-Fed Buffaloes' and parts of 'The Congo' exhibiting a fiery and furious, zany, at times incoherent delivery that appears to have owed more to jazz than poetry, though the highly religious Lindsay was always reluctant to align himself thus.

Part of the success and great fame that Lindsay achieved—albeit briefly—was due to the singular manner in which he presented his poetry "fundamentally as a performance, as an aural and temporal experience...meant...to be chanted, whispered, belted out, sung, amplified by gesticulation and movement, and punctuated by shouts and whoops." [2]

His best-known poem, "The Congo," exemplified his revolutionary aesthetic of sound for sound's sake. It imitates the pounding of the drums in the rhythms and in onomatopoeic nonsense words. At parts, the poem ceases to use conventional words when representing the chants of Congo's indigenous people, relying just on sound alone.

Lindsay's extensive correspondence with the poet W. B. Yeats details his intentions of reviving the musical qualities of poetry as they were practiced by the ancient Greeks. Because of his identity as a performance artist and his use of American midwestern themes, Lindsay became known in the 1910s as the "Prairie Troubador."

In the final twenty years of his life, Lindsay was one of the best known poets in the U.S. His reputation enabled him to befriend, encourage and mentor other poets, such as Langston Hughes and Sara Teasdale. His poetry, though, lacked elements which encouraged the attention of academic scholarship, and, after his death, he became an obscure figure.

Attitudes towards race

Most contemporaries acknowledged Lindsay's intention to be an advocate for African-Americans. This intention was particularly evident in the 1918 poem "The Jazz Birds", praising the war efforts of African-Americans during World War I, an issue to which the vast majority of the white US seemed blind. Additionally, W.E.B. Du Bois hailed Lindsay's story "The Golden-Faced People" for its insights into racism. Lindsay saw himself as anti-racist not only in his own writing but in his encouragement of a writer he credited himself with discovering: Langston Hughes, who, while working as a busboy at a Washington, D.C. restaurant where Lindsay ate, gave Lindsay copies of his poems.

However, many contemporaries and later critics have contended over whether a couple of Lindsay's poems should be seen as homages to African and African-American music, as perpetuation of the "savage African" stereotype, or as both. DuBois, before reading and praising "the Golden-Faced People," wrote in a review of Lindsay's "Booker T. Washington Trilogy" that "Lindsay knows two things, and two things only, about Negroes: The beautiful rhythm of their music and the ugly side of their drunkards and outcasts. From this poverty of material he tries now and then to make a contribution to Negro literature. ... It goes without saying that he only partially succeeds." Added DuBois: "Mr. Lindsay knows little of the Negro, and that little is dangerous." DuBois also criticized "The Congo," which has been the most persistent focus of the criticisms of racial stereotyping in Lindsay's work.

Subtitled "A Study of the Negro Race" and beginning with a section titled "Their Basic Savagery", "The Congo" reflects the tensions within a relatively isolated and pastoral society suddenly confronted by the industrialized world. The poem was inspired by a sermon preached in October 1913 that detailed the drowning of a missionary in the Congo River; this event had drawn worldwide criticism, as had the colonial exploitation of the Congo under the government of Leopold II of Belgium. Lindsay defended the poem; in a letter to Joel Spingarn, chairman of the board of directors of the NAACP, Lindsay wrote that "My 'Congo' and 'Booker T. Washington Trilogy' have both been denounced by the Colored people for reasons that I cannot fathom.... The third section of 'The Congo' is certainly as hopeful as any human being dare to be in regard to any race." Spingarn responded by acknowledging Lindsay's good intentions, but saying that Lindsay sometimes glamorized differences between people of African descent and people of other races, while many African-Americans wished to emphasize the "feelings and desires" that they held in common with others.

Similarly, critics in academia often portray Lindsay as a well-meaning but misguided primitivist in his representations of Africans and African Americans. One such critic, Rachel DuPlessis, argues that the poem, while perhaps meant to be "hopeful," actually "others" Africans as an inherently violent race. In the poem and in Lindsay's defenses of it, DuPlessis hears Lindsay warning white readers not to be "hoo-doo'd" or seduced by violent African "mumbo jumbo."  This warning seems to suggest that white civilization has been "infected" by African violence; Lindsay thus, in effect, "blames blacks for white violence directed against them." Conversely, Susan Gubar notes approvingly that "the poem contains lines blaming black violence on white imperialism." While acknowledging that the poem seems to have given its author and audiences an excuse to indulge in "'romantic racism' or 'slumming in slang,'" she also observes that Lindsay was "much more liberal than many of his poetic contemporaries," and that he seems to have intended a statement against the kind of racist violence perpetrated under Leopold in the Congo.

Later years

Fame
Lindsay's fame as a poet grew in the 1910s. Because Harriet Monroe showcased him with two other Illinois poets—Carl Sandburg and Edgar Lee Masters—his name became linked to theirs. The success of either of the other two, in turn, seemed to help the third.

In 1932, Edgar Lee Masters published an article on modern poetry in The American Mercury that praised Lindsay extensively and wrote a biography of Lindsay in 1935 (four years after its subject's death) entitled Vachel Lindsay: A Poet in America.

Lindsay himself indicated in the 1915 preface to "The Congo" that no less a figure than William Butler Yeats respected his work. Yeats felt they shared a concern for capturing the sound of the primitive and of singing in poetry. In 1915, Lindsay gave a poetry reading to President Woodrow Wilson and the entire Cabinet.

Marriage, children and financial troubles
Lindsay's private life was rife with disappointments, such as his unsuccessful courtship in 1914 of fellow poet Sara Teasdale before she married rich businessman Ernst Filsinger. While this itself may have caused Lindsay to become more concerned with money, his financial pressures would greatly increase later on.

In 1924 he moved to Spokane, Washington, where he lived in room 1129 of the Davenport Hotel until 1929. On May 19, 1925, at age 45, he married 23-year-old Elizabeth Connor. The new pressure to support his considerably younger wife escalated when they had a daughter, Susan Doniphan Lindsay, in May 1926 (wife of Lord Amberley) and son Nicholas Cave Lindsay in September 1927.

Desperate for money, Lindsay undertook an exhausting string of readings throughout the East and Midwest from October 1928 through March 1929. During this time, Poetry magazine awarded him a lifetime achievement award of $500 (equivalent to about $ in today's dollars). In April 1929, Lindsay and his family moved to the house of his birth in Springfield, Illinois, an expensive undertaking. In that same year, coinciding with the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Lindsay published two more poetry volumes: The Litany of Washington Street and Every Soul A Circus. He gained money by doing odd jobs throughout but in general earned very little during his travels.

Suicide
Crushed by financial worry and in failing health from his six-month road trip, Lindsay sank into depression. On December 5, 1931, he committed suicide by drinking a bottle of lye. His last words were: "They tried to get me; I got them first!"

Legacy

Literary

Lindsay, a versatile and prolific writer and poet, helped to "keep alive the appreciation of poetry as a spoken art"  whose poetry was said to "abound in meter and rhymes and is no shredded prose", had a traditional verse structure and was described by a contemporary in 1924 as "pungent phrases, clinging cadences, dramatic energy, comic thrust, lyric seriousness and tragic intensity". Lindsay's biographer, Dennis Camp, says that Lindsay's ideas on "civic beauty and civic tolerance" were published in 1912 in his broadside "The Gospel of Beauty" and that later, in 1915, Lindsay published the first American study of film as an art form, The Art of The Moving Picture. Camp notes that on Lindsay's tombstone is recorded a single word, "Poet".

Vachel Lindsay House
The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency helps to maintain the Vachel Lindsay House at 603 South Fifth Street in Springfield, the site of Lindsay's birth and death. The agency donated the house to the state, which then closed it for restoration at a cost of $1.5 million. As of October 8, 2014, the site was again open to the public, with guided tours available on Thursday to Sunday from 1 to 5 pm. Lindsay's grave lies in Oak Ridge Cemetery. The bridge crossing the midpoint of Lake Springfield, built in 1934, is named in Lindsay's honor.

Archives
The Vachel Lindsay Archive resides at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia. It comprises his personal papers, manuscripts of his works, correspondence, photographs, artworks, printing blocks, books from his personal library, and a comprehensive collection of books by and about Lindsay. 
The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a small collection of manuscripts and other items sent by Lindsay to Eugenia Graham.

Woodmoor is an unincorporated community and a census-designated place (CDP) located in and governed by El Paso County, Colorado, United States. The CDP is a part of the Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population of the Woodmoor CDP was 9,536 at the United States Census 2020. The Monument post office (Zip Code 80132) serves the area.

Geography
The approximate center of Woodmoor is 1.5 miles due east of the center of Monument, Colorado.

The Woodmoor CDP has an area of , including  of water.

Common Areas
The Woodmoor Commons have been somewhat of a mystery since there were no signs designating those areas for common use and no maps available to all Woodmoor Residents which designate the location of the common areas. In 1994, the Woodmoor Improvement Association rounded up volunteer residents to hike the areas, name them, build and install signs to the bigger areas, and prepare the first Guide to the Woodmoor Commons.
Additionally, Woodmoor has numerous bridle trails in both North and South Woodmoor.

Demographics

The United States Census Bureau initially defined the  for the
Colin Campbell, 3rd Earl of Argyll (c. 1486 – 9 October 1529) was a Scottish nobleman and soldier. He was also known as "Cailen Malloch".

Life
Colin Campbell was the son of Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll and Lady Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox. In 1506/07, he married Lady Jean Gordon, the eldest daughter of Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly by his first wife, Lady Jean Stewart. He succeeded as Earl of Argyll upon the death of his father on 9 September 1513.

Campbell led an army against the insurrection of various Highland chieftains; a few years later, he joined the court of King James V of Scotland. He was given the position of Lord Warden of the Marches, and in 1528, Lord Justice General of Scotland. He died on 9 October 1529, and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church in Cowal, Scotland.
 
Colin Campbell was succeeded by his son, Archibald Campbell. The Campbell family resided at Castle Campbell, near Dollar, Clackmannanshire, Scotland.

Ancestry
The Midland RockHounds are a Minor League Baseball team based in Midland, Texas. The team, which plays in the Texas League, is the Double-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics major league club. The RockHounds play in Momentum Bank Ballpark, which opened in 2002 and seats 4,709 fans. They have won seven Texas League championships: in 1975 (co-champions with the Lafayette Drillers), 2005, 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

History
The RockHounds were previously known as both the Midland Cubs (1972–1984) and Midland Angels (1985–1998). While Midland has been the Double-A affiliate of the Oakland A's since 1999, they were affiliated with the Chicago Cubs from 1972 to 1984, and then with the California Angels from 1985 to 1998. The team was renamed “Rockhounds,” a nickname for geologists, as a reference to the oil and gas industry of the area.

The RockHounds have received numerous awards throughout their history. The Midland franchise under the Angels won the Texas League Organization of the Year in 1990 and 1994 and as the RockHounds in 2002. In 1995, Midland won Double-A Baseball's highest award, the Bob Frietas Award. General Manager Monty Hoppel has been named Executive of the Year with the franchise three times (1991, 1995, and 2002).

In 1995, Midland reached its first-ever playoff appearance as an affiliate of the Angels and their first playoff appearance overall in 20 years. It also became the first season that Midland accumulated more than 200,000 fans in a season, a feat repeated in 1996. The feat surprised many in Minor League Baseball as the Midland-Odessa area only has just over 200,000 residents total. The RockHounds moved into Momentum Bank Ballpark, part of the Scharbauer Sports Complex on the west side of Midland, in 2002. Since then, the RockHounds have averaged over 250,000 fans every season. Prior to that, their home had been what is now known as Christensen Stadium, in northeast Midland.

The Rockhounds won their first ever Texas League Championship in 2005. They shared the title with the Lafayette Drillers in 1975 as the Cubs. In 2006, they won the second-half championship of the South Division, but they lost to the eventual champion Corpus Christi Hooks in the division playoffs.

In 2007, the RockHounds won the John H. Johnson President's Award, Minor League baseball highest award for a franchise, making them the third Texas League franchise to do so after the El Paso Diablos and the Tulsa Drillers.

In 2009, the RockHounds won their second Texas League pennant, defeating the Northwest Arkansas Naturals three games to one in the Championship Series. In 2010, the RockHounds returned to the Texas League title game, but this time fell to the Naturals.

In 2017, the RockHounds won their fourth straight Texas League title, the first team to do so since the Fort Worth Panthers won six in a row from 1920-25.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball's restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the RockHounds were organized into the Double-A Central. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

On the radio
The Midland Rockhounds have always had a play-by-play broadcast that has been available. KCRS (AM) had been the network to carry roughly 95% of the Rockhounds games since they debuted in 1972. Some afternoon games in 2008 didn't air on the radio due to contracts with Rush Limbaugh and others. For the 2009 season Gap Broadcasting announced the Rockhounds would have a new radio home, KFZX, also known as 102.1 Jack FM. For the 2010 season, the Rockhounds once again moved radio homes to KMRK 96.1 FM. In both cases Bob Hards remained the voice of the Rockhounds, a position he has currently held for 19 consecutive years. In 2013 the Rockhounds moved their games back to KCRS, though weekday day games would be preempted for talk shows that were already scheduled.

Roster
The Avars, also known as Maharuls (Avar: , , "mountaineers") are a Northeast Caucasian  ethnic group. The Avars are the largest of several ethnic groups living in the Russian republic of Dagestan. The Avars reside in the North Caucasus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Alongside other ethnic groups in the North Caucasus region, the Avars live in ancient villages located approximately 2,000 m above sea level. The Avar language spoken by the Caucasian Avars belongs to the family of Northeast Caucasian languages. Sunni Islam has been the prevailing religion of the Avars since the 13th century.

Ethnonyms
According to 19th-century Russian historians, the Avars' neighbors usually referred to them as Tavlins (tavlintsy). This is an exonym. Vasily Potto wrote that those to the south usually knew them as Tavlins (tavlintsy). Potto wrote, "The words in different languages have the same meaning... [of] mountain dwellers [or] highlanders." Potto claimed that members of Avarian tribe also often referred to themselves by the alternate endonym , also meaning "mountaineer".

Most of those known as Tavlins trace their lineage to the upper parts of two tributaries of the Sulak River: the Andiyskoe Koisu and Avarskoye Koisu.

History 
Between the 5th and 12th centuries, Georgian Orthodox Christianity was introduced to the Avar valleys. During the Islamic conquests, Arabs invaded the Caucasus, conquering Azerbaijan in 639 and Derbent in 643. They also founded the Emirate of Tbilisi in 736. Later, the Christian kingdom of Sarir governed much of modern-day Dagestan. The Kingdom of Georgia was also Christian. However, when Sarir fell in the early 12th century and Mongol invasions led by Subutai and Jebe weakened Georgia, Christian influence in the area ended. The Avar Khanate, a predominantly Muslim polity, succeeded Sarir. The only extant monument of Sarir architecture is the 10th-century Datuna Church in the village of Datuna. The Mongol invasions seem not to have affected the Avar territory, and the alliance with the Golden Horde enabled the Avar khans to increase their prosperity. In the 15th century the Horde declined, and the Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh rose to power. The Shamkhalate absorbed the Avar Khanate.

From the 16th century onwards, the Persians and Ottomans began expanding their territory in the Caucasus. By the mid-16th century, what is now Dagestan, eastern Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia were under Safavid Persian rule. The area that is now western Georgia fell under Ottoman Turkish control. Although the Ottoman Turks briefly gained Dagestan during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590, Dagestan and many of its Avar inhabitants stayed under Persian suzerainty for many centuries. Despite Persian rule, many ethnic groups in Dagestan, including many Avars, retained relatively high amounts of freedom and self-governance.

After the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723, Russia briefly took Dagestan from the Persians. The Persians reestablished full control over the Caucasus again in the early 18th century under Nader Shah's Caucasus campaign and Dagestan campaign. During that same time, the Avars routed one of Nader Shah's armies at Andalal during the later stages of his Dagestan campaign. In the wake of this triumph, Umma Khan of the Avars (reigned 1774–1801) managed to extract tribute from most states of the Caucasus, including Shirvan and Georgia.

Umma Khan died in 1801. Two years later, the khanate voluntarily submitted to Russian authority following the Russian annexation of Georgia and the Treaty of Georgievsk. This was only confirmed after considerable Russian successes and the victory in the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813, after which Persia lost southern Dagestan and many of its other Caucasian territories to Russia. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other areas where the Avars lived.

The Russians instituted heavy taxes, expropriated estates, and constructed fortresses in the Avar region. The Avar population revolted under the flag of the Muslim Imamate of Dagestan. Ghazi Mohammed (1828–1832), Gamzat-bek (1832–1834), and Shamil (1834–1859) led the revolts.

This Caucasian War raged until 1864, when the Avarian Khanate was abolished and replaced by the Avarian District. Some Avars refused to collaborate with Russians and migrated to Turkey, where their descendants live to this day. Despite war and emigration, the Avars retained their position as the dominant ethnic group in Dagestan during the Soviet period. After World War II, many Avars left the barren highlands for the fertile plains closer to the shores of the Caspian Sea.

Description 

The Avarians are a Northeast Caucasian people who speak Avar, a Northeast Caucasian language. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the Turanian nomads also share the name Avar. The Encyclopedia Britannica describes the Turanian nomads as "a people of undetermined origin and language."

As of 2002, the Avarians numbered about 1.04 million. 912,020 Avarians lived in Russia during the 2010 census; 850,011 of them lived in Dagestan. Only 32% lived in cities. Avarians inhabit most of the mountainous part of Dagestan as well the plains (Buynaksk, Khasavyurt, Kizilyurt and other regions). Outside of Dagestan, Russian Avars also live in Chechnya and Kalmykia.

As of 1999, 50,900 Avarians lived in the Balakan and Zakatala rayons of Azerbaijan. The Avarian  population of Azerbaijan had decreased to 49,800 by 2009. In 2002, 1,996 Kvareli Avars lived in Georgia.

In Turkey, Avarians are considered "ethnic Turks", and so aren't counted as their own ethnic group on the census. This makes it difficult to know exactly how many Avarians live in Turkey. According to Ataev B.M., who referenced A.M. Magomeddadaev's research, the Avarian population there should have been around 53,000 in 2005.

Ethnic groups 

Avarian is a collective term; among the Avarians there are around 15 sub-ethnic groups, including the Avar, Andi, and Tsez (Dido) peoples.

Avarians as highlanders and armed people 
, transliterated as  means "inhabitants of the top grounds, mountaineers." Another group of Avarians is described as belonging to a different category,  ((with a soft "χ"). This term means "inhabitants of plains (warm valleys) and gardeners".

The name "Avarians" has a narrower meaning; it has a national meaning connected with former statehood. "Avar" is a significant part of the word "Avaria," which refers to the Khunzakh Khanate. The Khanate formed in the 12th century after the disintegration of Sаrir. From the middle of the 19th century, this territory was the Avarian District of the Daghestan area. This area is now referred to as Khunzakhsky District of Dagestan. Khunzakhsky District is referred to as  in literary Avarian and  in a local dialect.

The modern literary language of Avarias, both in the past and today, is known among Avarians as the language of . The Avarian word  means "army, armed people." According to reconstructions, this word descends from  in the proto-Avarian language ("ʔ" represents a glottal stop).

Names for the Avars 

In modern Avarian, three words retain the ancient basis of . They include , meaning "envoy, prophet, messiah"; , meaning "pommel of a saddle"; and , meaning "obstacle, opposition".  means "to make an obstacle, to resist." There is also an Avarian river called  in Avarian and  in Russian.

All three listed words are found in ancient lexicons of the Iranian languages. The Parthian word  and the Middle Persian word  both mean "up, on, over" and "higher, superior." The Middle Persian word  means "acclivity," or uphill slope. Similar Middle Persian words include , meaning "superior"; , meaning "god, divinity"; , meaning "noble"; , meaning "to surpass", and , meaning "to attack".

At the same time, according to the morphology of the Middle Persian language, the word , meaning "superior" can also be translated as "Aβarian", "Khurasanian", and "Parthian" as seen, for example, in a Middle Persian word, , meaning "Iranian".

The first known use of the term "Avar" was in the 10th century. According to Persian author Ibn Rustah, a so-called governor of Sarir, Johannes de Galonifontibus was the first person to write about Avars under the name "Avar." He wrote in 1404 that "Circassians, Leks, Yasses, Alans, Avars, [and] Kazikumukhs" live in the Caucasus. According to Vladimir Minorsky, one account from 1424 called the Daghestanian Avars the Auhar.

Azerbaijani writer Abbasgulu Bakikhanov wrote that the "inhabitants of vicinities of Agran have been moved here from Khurasan. A residence of this emir also was Agran". The editor of this book, an academician of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, Z.M. Buniyatov, confirms that this "Agran" corresponds to the Avar Khanate.

The word "Agran" is unknown to modern Avars. According to the Altiranisches Wörterbuch, written by Christian Bartholomae, "agra" means  in his language, German. This corresponds to "first, upper, beginning, tip" in English. He also wrote that "agra'va" meant  in German, which translates to "from the top, coming from the upper side."

Nöldeke, Hübschmann, Frye, Christensen and Enoki identify Aparshahr/Abarshahr/Abharshahr/Abrashahr with Khurasan, a historical region of Iran, or with Nishapur, an Iranian city. The Khurasan in Iranian studies is known as "rise of Sun." The Parthian word  (Middle Persian , meaning "up, on, over") and Parthian/Middle Persian  are cognate with Old Iranian , which means "empire, power, the sovereign house.") In summary, Aparšahr/Aβaršahr is very similar to the German word . According to historian H.W. Haussig, Aβaršahr means  ("Kingdom of the Abar") and should be sought in the south-western territory of the Western Turkic Khaganate.

A Dahae tribe, the Aparnak (Parni) moved from the south-eastern shore of the Caspian Sea (part of modern Turkmenistan), into the territory of Khurasan, where they founded a confederation of Dahae tribes that Avestani texts referred to as "barbarians" and "enemies of Aryans," according to Christian Bartholomae.

On the border of Khurasan, the Sassanid Persians built a strong wall, named the "Great Wall of Gorgan" or "The Red Snake." The wall was built to protect Iran from invasion by the White Huns (Hepthalites; called Khionites, X'iiaona and Xyôn in Zoroastrian texts). Later another wave of White Huns conquered Khurasan and occupied it for a long time. According to Richard Helli: "By such reasoning, the Ephthalites are thought to have originated at Hsi-mo-ta-lo (southwest of Badakhshan and near the Hindu Kush), which tantalizingly, stands for Himtala, 'snow plain', which may be the Sanskritized form of Hephthal." In 484, the Hephthalite chief Akhshunwar led his army to attack the Sassanian King Peroz I, who was defeated and killed in Khurasan. After the victory, the Hephthalite empire extended to Merv and Herat. Some of the White Huns drew up a peace treaty with Iran and the two became allies, both fighting against the Byzantine Empire. Thus, Hephthalites lived in the Khurasan/Khorasan area. According to the Chinese classic Liang chih-kung-t'u,  (pinyin:) was the name the Hephthalites used for themselves, and that is probably a Chinese transfer of a similar-sounding word, war/Uar.

Mehmed Tezcan writes that according to a Chinese record, the Hephthalites descended from a Ruan Ruan tribe called Hua in the Qeshi region (near Turpan). This tribe came to Tokharistan and soon settled also in eastern regions of Khorasan at the beginning of the 5th century. About the same time, the name Avars/Awards appears in the sources. Again, in his well-known Atlas of China, A. Herrmann shows the eastern regions of Khorasan, Tokharistan, etc. as the dominions of Afu/Hua/Awards/Hephthalites between ca. 440 and 500 A.D., relying on the identification Hua = Uar = Awar.

The German researcher Karl Heinrich Menges considered Eurasian Avars to be one of the ancient Mongol peoples, who "were the first to use the title ga gan (later qān, ḵān) for their supreme ruler." He describes the "traces of a Mongol residue in Daghestan".

The Avar language belongs to the Avar-Andi-Tsez subgroup of the Northeast Caucasian (or Nakh–Dagestanian) language family. The writing is based on the Cyrillic script, which replaced the Arabic script used before 1927 and the Latin script used between 1927 and 1938. More than 60% of the Avars living in Dagestan speak Russian as their second language.

Media files
The Rev. George Bramwell Evens (15 February 1884–20 November 1943) was, under the pseudonym Romany (and sometimes The Tramp), a British radio broadcaster and writer on countryside and natural history matters – quite possibly the first to broadcast on such issues. He was also a Minister of the Methodist Church.

Biography

Evens' mother was Romani, born in a vardo (Romany wagon). His father was Salvation Army Lieutenant George Evens, a native of Plymouth. He was born at 3 Argyll Street, Anlaby Road, Hull, England and educated at Epworth College, Rhyl, as boarder, then at Queens College, Taunton. He married Eunice, the daughter of The Reverend Owen Thomas on 1 August 1911.

He is most famous for his Out with the Romany radio programmes (later Out with Romany), which commenced in 1933 on the BBC's Children's Hour, describing travels in his own vardo (purchased in 1921, at Brough Hill Fair, for £75), with Comma the horse, his English Cocker Spaniel Raq, and his young friends Muriel and Doris. Although the programmes were all pre-scripted and performed entirely in the studio, the impression given was of Romany and his friends going for a walk in the countryside and spontaneously discussing the plants and animals they came across. Raphael Samuel saw the programme as instrumental in making the countryside desirable for a generation of listeners. Simon Barnes has paid tribute to how his father (radio) and himself (books) were drawn to natural history by Romany: "I longed to walk through the country with the all-knowing, all-seeing Romany".

As a Methodist minister, Evens' ministries included Goole; the Methodist Central Hall, Carlisle (1914–1926); Huddersfield (1926–1929); and the King Cross Methodist Chapel, Halifax (1929–1939), after which ill health forced him to give up the ministry. He retired to Wilmslow, where he died, leaving his wife, son Glyn and daughter, Romany June.

His ashes were scattered, at his request, at Old Parks Farm, Glassonby, Cumbria, which he had enjoyed visiting over a 22-year period: in 2001, a memorial to him was erected to him there by The Romany Society. 

The vardo was donated, unconditionally, by his widow, to the forerunners of Cheshire East Borough Council (CEBC). For many years it was displayed by CEBC, outdoors, in Wilmslow. In late 2012, having deteriorated badly, it was restored and moved to Bradford Industrial Museum, to be displayed indoors.

The Romany Society, originally formed in 1943, disbanded in 1965, and re-founded in 1996, celebrates his life and work, with regular newsletters and an annual magazine. Its patron is Terry Waite.

The BBC radio programmes were all broadcast live, and only one recording survives – dated October 1943, just a month before his death. It was released on CD in 2006.
The Alex Fraser Bridge (also known as the Annacis Bridge) is a cable-stayed bridge over the Fraser River that connects Richmond and New Westminster with North Delta in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia. The bridge is named for Alex Fraser (1916 – 1989), a former British Columbia Minister of Transportation. The bridge was the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world when it opened on September 22, 1986, and was the longest in North America until the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, in the U.S. state of South Carolina opened in 2005.

Overview
The Alex Fraser Bridge is  long with a main span of . The towers are  tall. It consists of seven lanes, three in each direction with the middle lane acting as a reversible lane, and had a maximum speed limit of 90 km per hour until July 24, 2019 when the speed limit was lowered to 70 km/h to accommodate the additional reversible lane.  Upon opening in 1986, only four of the six available lanes were open. Cyclists and pedestrians share two narrow sidewalks one on each side. All six lanes opened in 1987 after traffic demand justified the need.

The bridge's southern end is in North Delta and its northern end is on Delta's Annacis Island.  Connections on its southern end lead to Blaine, Washington and to White Rock.  The connections on the northern end lead into the cities of New Westminster, Richmond, and Burnaby, and on into Vancouver itself.  It is a major artery in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia.

The bridge was constructed for the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and was designed by a joint venture of Klohn Crippen Berger and Buckland & Taylor (Now COWI North America). Its total cost was $58 million.

Recent history
In December 2016, the Alex Fraser Bridge along with the Port Mann Bridge dropped "ice bombs," also called "slush bombs" on vehicles causing damage to windshields.  The Alex Fraser has the cables along the sides of the driving lanes where as the Port Mann has them cross over-top of the driving lanes. In addition to 2016, this also happened on the Alex Fraser in 2005, 2008, and 2012. The Alex Fraser needed to be closed a few times during December 2016 due to the possibility of ice bombs; this caused major traffic problems in the region. To combat this issue, the BC Government announced that a heavy lift helicopter will be used to blow snow and ice off the cables to prevent it from accumulating and falling onto the cars below.

An announcement was made on January 19, 2017, that a new seventh travel lane will be added on the bridge by slightly narrowing the existing lanes and removing the shoulders. A reversible lane system with movable barrier was added to help ease traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours. The new seventh lane opened to traffic on September 14, 2019, with the moveable reversible zipper in operation on December 16, 2019.

Calvin Zabo, the alter ego of Marvel Comics character Mister HydeThe Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) is a professional association for journalists writing about Major League Baseball for daily newspapers, magazines and qualifying websites. The organization was founded in 1908, and is known for its annual awards and voting on membership in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Early years
The BBWAA was founded on October 14, 1908, to improve working conditions for sportswriters in the early part of the 20th century; It also sought to promote uniformity of scoring methods, and to professionalize the press box, such that access was limited only to working reporters, telegraphers, and others who had a reason to be there. 

The organization began with 43 founding members. They included Joe S. Jackson, who became the association's first president. At that time, Jackson was the sporting editor (today called sports editor) of the Detroit Free Press. Also selected as officers were Irving E. Sanborn of the Chicago Tribune, syndicated columnist Hugh Fullerton, and The Boston Globe baseball writer Tim Murnane. A second meeting was held in New York City in December; Sanborn decided he could not serve as an officer at that time, and he was replaced by William Weart of the Philadelphia Times. The slate of officers was ratified, and anyone who wrote about baseball in major league cities was eligible for membership. This policy changed, however, in December 1913, at which time it was decided that minor league baseball writers could also become members. Then, Jackson became a dominant force in the early years of the baseball writers, being elected as president of the association during nine consecutive terms. 

Jackson finally retired in 1919, while Sanborn returned to assume the position of president. After that, Jackson became a member of the BBWAA Board of Directors.

Mission
The organization's primary function is to work with Major League Baseball and individual teams to assure clubhouse and press-box access for BBWAA members. In addition, BBWAA members also elect players to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, which is the organization's most public function. All writers with 10 continuous years of membership in the BBWAA, plus active BBWAA membership at any time in the preceding 10 years, are eligible to vote for the Hall of Fame. The BBWAA also votes annually for the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Most Valuable Player Award, Cy Young Award, Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year Award, and Manager of the Year Award in each of the two major leagues. The Hall of Fame also empowers the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee, made up of 11 or 12 veteran BBWAA members, to formulate the annual ballot for the Veterans Committee.

Considering the ready availability of television broadcasts for the majority of baseball games, plus instant access to information through the Internet, some have called into question why the BBWAA has not broadened its membership rules to include broadcasters and researchers. (Similar arguments were made for the inclusion of Web-based journalists, before the BBWAA added Web writers to its ranks in December 2007.)

Others have openly questioned why the BBWAA is involved in the award and Hall of Fame voting processes at all, citing in some cases journalistic integrity and the need to remain unbiased in their coverage of newsworthy events.

Awards voting
The BBWAA's most public function is to annually vote on candidates for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The Out of the Park Baseball video game gives players the chance to participate in the BBWAA's election.

In addition, the BBWAA is responsible for voting on several annual awards in each major league, including:
Most Valuable Player Award
Cy Young Award
Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year Award
Manager of the Year Award

In or about 2000, the BBWAA took over the voting responsibility for the Edgar Martínez Award, given each year to the outstanding designated hitter in the American League.

From 1953 to 1962, the BBWAA presented a "Sophomore of the Year Award" in each league.

In 1997, a 36-member BBWAA panel selected the Major League Baseball All-Time Team.

Awards display
Replicas of various BBWAA awards and lists of past winners are displayed at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, in the Records Room, which also has other exhibits, including charts showing active and all-time leaders in various baseball statistical categories.

BBWAA Career Excellence Award

The annual BBWAA Career Excellence Award is the highest award given by the BBWAA. First awarded in 1962 to J. G. Taylor Spink, longtime publisher of The Sporting News, it was named the J. G. Taylor Spink Award until adopting its current name in February 2021. It has been awarded annually for "meritorious contributions to baseball writing", except for one year during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Recipients are not considered members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the Hall's library.

Web membership
In 2007, the BBWAA opened its membership to web-based writers employed on a full-time basis by "websites that are credentialed by MLB for post-season coverage."

During the 2012 World Series, the Association elected its first female president, Susan Slusser, of the San Francisco Chronicle.

List of members

Names of members are followed by the name of the organization for whom they write.

Through the 2000s, writers for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Baltimore Sun said that they were no longer permitted by their employers to vote for the organization's awards. The New York Times said in 2021 that their writers have been prohibited from participating in any awards-giving body since 1989, under the rationale that "journalists should report the news, not help make it". The Los Angeles Times has a similar policy, though it appears to be negotiable.

The acre-foot is a non-SI unit of volume equal to about  commonly used in the United States in reference to large-scale water resources, such as reservoirs, aqueducts, canals, sewer flow capacity, irrigation water, and river flows.

An acre-foot equals approximately an eight-lane swimming pool,  long,  wide and  deep.

Definitions

As the name suggests, an acre-foot is defined as the volume of one acre of surface area to a depth of one foot.

Since an acre is defined as a chain by a furlong (i.e.), an acre-foot is .

There are two definitions of an acre-foot (differing by about 0.0006%), depending on whether the "foot" used is an "international foot" or a "U.S. survey foot".

Application
As a rule of thumb in US water management, one acre-foot is taken to be the planned annual water usage of a suburban family household. In some areas of the desert Southwest, where water conservation is followed and often enforced, a typical family uses only about 0.25 acre-foot of water per year. One acre-foot/year is approximately .

The acre-foot per year has been used historically in the US in many water-management agreements, for example the Colorado River Compact, which divides  among seven western US states.

Water reservoir capacities in the US are commonly given in thousands of acre-feet, abbreviated TAF or KAF.

In most other countries except the US, the metric system is in common use and water volumes are normally expressed in liter, cubic meter or cubic kilometer. One acre-foot is approximately equivalent to 1.233 megaliters. Large bodies of water may be measured in cubic kilometers (1,000,000,000 m, or 1000 gigaliter), with 1 million acre-feet approximately equalling 1.233 km.
Te Pāti Māori, also known as the Māori Party, is a political party in New Zealand advocating indigenous rights. It contests the specially reserved Māori electorates, in which its main rival is the Labour Party. 

Under the current leadership of Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, it promotes the following policies: the upholding of tikanga Māori, the dismantling of systemic racism, and the strengthening of the rights and tino rangatiratanga promised in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The party is also committed to a mixture of socially progressive and green policy through a "Tiriti-centric" lens. This includes eradicating Goods and Services Tax on food, opposing deep sea drilling, organising and funding a Māori health authority, lifting the minimum wage to $25 an hour, returning Department of Conservation land to Māori kaitiaki, and reducing homelessness. Since Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer's leadership began, the party has been described as left-wing, progressive, and "unapologetically Māori". 

Tariana Turia founded the Māori Party in 2004 after resigning from the governing Labour Party, in which she served as a minister, over the foreshore and seabed ownership controversy. She and Pita Sharples, a high-profile academic, became the first co-leaders. The party won four Māori seats in the 2005 election and went into Opposition. After the 2008, 2011 and 2014 elections, where the party won five, three and two Māori seats respectively, it supported a government led by the centre-right National Party, with the Māori Party co-leaders serving as ministers outside cabinet. During this time, the party advocated more moderate politics.

The party won no seats in the 2017 election, which was analysed as being backlash for their support of National. Under new leadership they returned at the 2020 election, when Rawiri Waititi won the Waiariki electorate. Although the party's share of the country-wide party vote declined from 1.18% in 2017 to 1.17% in 2020, winning Waiariki gave the party the right to full proportional representation, giving it two MPs, with Debbie Ngarewa-Packer subsequently becoming a list MP. , the party's two MPs are also its co-leaders.

History

Formation

The origins of Te Pāti Māori can be traced back to the 2004 foreshore and seabed controversy, a debate about whether the Māori have legitimate claim to ownership of part or all of New Zealand's foreshore and seabed, that arose during the Fifth Labour Government. A court judgement stated that some Māori appeared to have the right to seek formal ownership of a specific portion of seabed in the Marlborough Sounds. This prospect alarmed many sectors of New Zealand society however, and the Labour Party foreshadowed legislation in favour of state ownership instead. This angered many Māori, including many of Labour's Māori MPs. Two MPs representing Māori electorates, Tariana Turia and Nanaia Mahuta, announced an intent to vote against the legislation.

Turia, a junior minister, after being informed that voting against the government would appear "incompatible" with holding ministerial rank, announced on 30 April 2004 her intention to resign from the Labour Party. Her resignation took effect on 17 May, and she left parliament until she won a by-election in her Te Tai Hauauru seat two months later. After leaving the Labour Party, Turia, later joined by Sharples, began organizing a new political party. They and their supporters agreed that the new organisation would simply use the name of "the Māori Party". They chose a logo of black and red – traditional Māori colours – incorporating a  design, also traditional. The leaders of the Māori Party indicated that they wished to unite "all Māori" into a single political movement. The party was formally established on 7 July 2004.

2005 election
In the 2005 election, the Māori Party won four out of seven Māori seats and 2.12% of the party vote. The latter entitled the party to only three list seats, so the fourth electorate seat caused an overhang seat. In the election night count, the party vote share was under 2% and the Māori Party would have got two overhang seats; when the overhang was reduced to one, National lost a list seat that they appeared to have won on election night. Tariana Turia held Te Tai Hauauru; Pita Sharples won the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate; Hone Harawira, son of Titewhai Harawira, won Te Tai Tokerau; and Te Ururoa Flavell won Waiariki.

First term, 2005–2008
In the post-election period the Māori Party convened a series of hui to decide whether to support Labour or National, though some party leaders indicated they preferred to deal with Labour. That day, however, Turia and Prime Minister Helen Clark met privately and ruled out a formal coalition. Coupled with the support of the New Zealand First, Greens and Progressives, Māori Party support would have given Clark just enough support to govern without the support of other parties. However, in the end, no deal was done and the Māori Party stayed in Opposition, citing that they were not prepared to compromise their positions.

Gerry Brownlee, Deputy Leader of the National Party, claimed after the election that Labour and National each could rely on "57 seats" out of the 62 required in the 2005 election to govern. This implied that National had received support from United Future (3), Act (2) and the Māori Party (4) in addition to National's own 49 seats. Brash himself later supported this statement and claimed he had witnesses to it. This came after the National Party tried to woo the Māori Party in attempts to both see if a coalition arrangement was feasible and to counter any attempts which may have been made by Helen Clark. Tariana Turia denied this claim.

On 24 January 2006 the Māori Party's four MPs were jointly welcomed to Rātana pā with the leader of the National Party, Don Brash, together with his delegation of eight MPs. They had been intended to be welcomed on half an hour apart but agreed to be welcomed and sit together. Turia disputed claims that this was pre-arranged, saying: "We're here for a birthday. We're not here for politics." However critics said this would have reminded onlookers of how the Māori Party and National were said to be in coalition or confidence and supply talks. This may also have served to reinforce the Labour Party's election campaign statement that a 'vote for the Māori Party is a vote for National'. One Rātana kaumatua (elder) said this was deliberate and deserved after the talks.

2008 election
In the 2008 general election the Māori Party retained all four of the seats it won in 2005, and won an additional seat, when Rahui Katene won Te Tai Tonga from Labour. Two seats were overhang seats. The party's share of the party vote rose slightly to 2.39%. The Labour Party won the party vote by a large majority in every Māori electorate, meaning that the typical Māori voter had split their vote, voting for a Māori Party candidate with their electorate vote and the Labour Party with their party vote.

The National Party won the most seats overall and formed a minority government with the support of the Māori Party, ACT New Zealand and United Future. Sharples was given the Minister of Māori Affairs portfolio and became an Associate Minister of Corrections and Associate Minister of Education. Turia became Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Associate Minister of Health and Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment. Hone Harawira was critical of the alliance with the National Party and was suspended from the Māori Party in February 2011. He left the party and formed the left-wing Mana Party in April 2011.

2011 election

In the 2011 general election the Māori Party was reduced from five seats to three, as the party vote split between it and Harawira's Mana Party. The Māori Party won three electorate seats. With 1.43% of the party vote, the party was entitled to two seats, resulting in an overhang of one seat. The three MPs were Pita Sharples in Tāmaki Makaurau, Tariana Turia in Te Tai Hauāuru and Te Ururoa Flavell in Waiāriki. Rahui Katene lost the Te Tai Tonga seat to Labour's Rino Tirikatene, and Hone Harawira won the Te Tai Tokerau seat for the Mana Party. The National Party again formed a minority government with the support of the Māori Party, ACT New Zealand and United Future. Pita Sharples again became Minister of Māori Affairs, and Sharples and Turia were ministers outside cabinet. With the retirement of Pita Sharples in 2014, Te Ururoa Flavell became the male co-leader of the party. Tariana Turia also retired in 2014.

2014 election

Final results from the 2014 general election gave the Māori Party two seats in Parliament. Te Ururoa Flavell won the Waiāriki electorate seat, and the party was entitled to one further list seat (to be occupied by the next person on the party list, Marama Fox) as they received 1.32% of the party vote.

2017 election
Prior to the 2017 general election, the Māori Party formed an electoral pact with the Mana Movement leader and former Māori Party MP Hone Harawira. The Māori Party agreed not to contest Te Tai Tokerau as part of a deal for the two parties to try to regain the Māori electorates from the Labour Party. In the election, they failed to take any seats, with Labour capturing all seven of the Māori electorates. Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell expressed sadness at the loss of seats and announced he would be resigning from politics. Fellow co-leader Marama Fox expressed bitterness at the party's defeat, remarking that New Zealand had chosen to return to the "age of colonization" and attacked the two major parties, National and Labour, for their alleged paternalism towards Māori. Fox commented that Māori have "gone back like a beaten wife to the abuser" in regards to Labour's sweep of the Māori seats. Metro Magazine described the Māori Party's poor results as being part of backlash against them for helping National form a government.  Within the following 12 months, the party’s senior figures resigned: Flavell and Fox stepped down from the co-leadership, as well as party president Tukoroirangi Morgan. This opened the field for a new generation of party leaders, namely Rāwiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer.

2020 election 
The party announced John Tamihere as its candidate for the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate in March 2020. Tamihere had held the electorate from 2002 to 2005, but for the Labour Party. He had also run for Mayor of Auckland in 2019 without success. Tamihere's mayoral campaign was more right-wing, and he said the Māori Party could happily work with the National Party. This contradicted Māori Party President Che Wilson, who had set out a clear preference to work with Labour and had said "if we ever do talk to National it will have to be a big deal for us to move that way again."

On 15 April 2020, the party announced that John Tamihere and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer were the new party co-leaders.

The party received a broadcasting allocation of $145,101 for the 2020 election.

At the 2020 general election, held in October, the Māori Party's Rawiri Waititi captured the Waiariki electorate, defeating Labour MP Tāmati Coffey by a margin of 836 votes. This allowed the Māori Party to enter Parliament, and with its party vote of 1.2%, it was entitled to two MPs. After Waititi, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer entered Parliament as the highest-ranked person on the party list.

Under the Māori Party's constitution, its co-leaders must be drawn from its MPs first, and one must be female and one male. As the only male Māori Party MP, Waititi replaced Tamihere as a co-leader.

On 11 November, former party co-leader Tamihere requested a vote recount in the Māori electorates of Tāmaki Makaurau and Te Tai Hauāuru, alleging Māori voters had encountered discrimination during the 2020 election. Tamihere claimed that the recount was intended to expose discriminatory laws such as the five-yearly Māori Electoral Option (which limited the ability of Māori to switch between the general and Māori rolls for a period five years). He also alleged longer wait times for Māori voters at election booths and some Māori not being allowed to vote on the Māori roll.

2020–2023 parliamentary term 
On 26 November 2020, Te Pāti Māori MPs Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer walked out of Parliament after the Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard did not allow them to speak due to parliamentary procedures limiting the speaking time by smaller parties. Waititi had attempted to pass a motion that their party leaders be allowed to give a 15-minute "address in reply" but Mallard had blocked the motion on the grounds that MPs from smaller parties were not scheduled to give their maiden speeches until the following week. Waititi described Mallard's decision as unfair while Ngarewa-Packer claimed that this was "another example of the Māori voice being silenced and ignored."

2020 election donations investigation 
On 12 April 2021, the Electoral Commission referred Te Pāti Māori to the Police for failing to disclose about NZ$320,000 worth of donations within the required timeframe. These donations came from several individuals and organisations including former party co-leader Tamihere (NZ$158,223.72), the Urban Māori Authority (NZ$48,879.85), and the Aotearoa Te Kahu Limited Partnership (NZ$120,000). Party President Che Wilson attributed the late disclosure to the fact that the party was staffed by volunteers and rookies who were unfamiliar with electoral finance laws. On 29 April, the Police referred the investigation into the Māori Party's undeclared donations to the Serious Fraud Office. By late September 2022, the Serious Fraud Office had closed the investigation and decided not to pursue prosecutions against the individuals and parties involved.

In late September 2022, Charities Services general manager Natasha Weight confirmed that the agency was investigating two charities headed by Party President Tamihere, the Te Whānau Waipareira Trust and the National Urban Māori Authority, for financing his 2020 election campaign. According to the Charities Register, Te Whānau o Waipareira Trust Group had loaned Tamihere NZ$385,307 to support his 2020 election campaign while the National Urban Māori Authority had paid NZ$82,695 to support his 2020 election campaign and Te Pāti Māori aspirations. Under existing legislation, charities are not allowed to donate and endorse political parties and candidates or allow them to use a charity's resources. In response, Tamihere accused the Charities Services of discriminating against Te Pāti Māori and Māori causes. Tamihere and Te Pāti Māori also confirmed that they would litigate against the Charities Service if the agency ruled against them. Tamihere also criticised The New Zealand Herald journalist Matt Nippert's coverage of the two charities' donations to his campaigns, accusing the newspaper of racism and announcing that Te Pāti Māori would boycott the Herald.

Hate Speech Task Force, 2021 
In June 2021, Te Pāti Māori called for a joint task force between the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and New Zealand Police targeting right-wing extremists and rising anti-Māori hate speech in response to a YouTube video featuring a masked man calling for the slaughter of Māori and for a civil war. The video was later removed by YouTube for a breach of its community guidelines. In a tweet, the party said that the video contained threats against its MPs, marae and Māori. Police arrested a man after receiving multiple complaints about the video and a day after Te Pāti Māori laid a complaint with the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA). A 44-year-old male was charged with making an objectionable publication.

In the complaint to the IPCA, the party accused the police of having double standards when dealing with death threats made against Pākehā and Māori. It compared the police's response to the video with the treatment of those who made death threats against National MP Simeon Brown. Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer stated, "Communication and response time was inadequate, the police have continued to minimise the nature of the threat against us and our people".

Whaitiri joins party
On 3 May 2023 sitting minister Meka Whaitiri announced that she had left the Labour Party to join Te Pāti Māori. Speaker of the House Adrian Rurawhe confirmed that Whaitiri would serve the remainder of her 2020–2023 term as an independent member of Parliament under standing order 35.5, which avoids invoking the "waka-jumping" provisions of the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act 2018. Whaitiri does not sit with her party in Parliament. She will recontest the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate as a Māori Party candidate.

On 10 May, Ngarewara-Packer and Waititi held a haka (dance) during Parliamentary proceedings to welcome Whaitiri to the Māori Party. In response, Rurawhe ordered Ngarewara-Packer and Waititi to leave Parliament since they had not obtained the permission of the Speaker or other parliamentary parties to hold the haka.

On 12 July, the party formally changed their name with the electoral commission from the Māori Party to Te Pāti Māori.

Principles and policy 
The party is committed to advancing what it sees as the rights and interests of the Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. Increasingly since the beginning of colonisation, Māori have been marginalised and the group is now a minority within New Zealand alongside Pacific Islanders. Te Pāti Māori policy focuses particularly on affordable housing, Māori recruitment into tertiary institutes and a living wage for all workers, based on the premise that Māori are among the low-socioeconomic communities in New Zealand who are the most economically disadvantaged. During the 2020s, Te Pāti Māori has been widely described as progressive, and further to the political left than Labour by Al Jazeera and Newshub. (Previously, during its years in alliance with National, the party had been described as centrist.)

The Māori Party was formed in response to the 2004 foreshore and seabed controversy, a debate about whether Māori have legitimate claim to ownership of part or all of New Zealand's foreshore and seabed. The founders of the party believed that:

Māori owned the foreshore and seabed before British colonisation;
 made no specific mention of foreshore or seabed;
No-one has subsequently purchased or otherwise acquired the foreshore or the seabed; and
Māori should therefore still own the seabed and the foreshore today.

The  (policy platform) of Te Pāti Māori is based on four principles or pillars:
  (includes policies regarding affordable housing, strengthening employment-support for Māori beneficiaries and te reo Māori)
 Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles (includes holding the Crown accountable to their obligations under , and policies on immigration)
  (includes policies on climate change in the Pacific and scholarships for Māori and Pasifika education to advance Māori and Pasifika as a collective)
  (includes policies on growing iwi economic resources and to protect freshwater as a)

These principles enable Te Pāti Māori to be held accountable for the maintenance and furthering of Māori concepts in the decision-making process. These concepts are not reflected in the traditional Westminster system and Māori customary law is excluded from the New Zealand general legal system.

Other Māori-rights-specific party policies have included the upholding of "indigenous values" and compulsory "heritage studies" in schools. In 2022 on Waitangi Day, the party called for Queen Elizabeth II to be removed as New Zealand's head of state and for the return of land to iwi and hapū.

The party is also committed to a mixture of socially progressive and environmentalist policy through a "Titiri-centric" Māori lens.  The party is committed to eradicating Goods and Services Tax on food, opposing deep sea drilling, organising and funding a Māori health authority and reducing homelessness in Māori communities.

Renaming New Zealand campaign 
In September 2021 the party launched an online petition to:
 change the country's official name to Aotearoa and
 officially restore Te Reo Māori names for all towns, cities and other place names.

In its statement is mentioned Article 3 of the Treaty of Waitangi which gave the Māori language equal status with English. By 17 September 2021, 51,000 had signed the petition.

By early June 2022, a petition from Te Pāti Māori to rename New Zealand as "Aotearoa" had received over 70,000 signatures. On 2 June, the petition was submitted before Parliament's petitions committee.  Waititi argued that the proposed name change would recognise New Zealand's indigenous heritage and strengthen its identity as a Pacific country. He opposed the idea of a referendum, claiming it would entrench the "tyranny of the majority".

Electoral results

Parliament

Leadership
, the constitution of Te Pāti Māori states that it must have two leaders, that its co-leaders must be drawn from its MPs first, and that one must be female and one male. These requirements have been in place since at least 2013.

The party's first leaders were Tariana Turia and Pita Sharples. In December 2012, Turia announced she would resign as party co-leader before the 2014 general election. Te Ururoa Flavell announced his interest in a leadership role, but as the Māori Party constitution required male and female co-leaders, he could not take Turia's place. Shortly after this, in July 2013, Sharples resigned as co-leader, saying he would quit politics altogether come the next general election in 2014. He went on to say that "Our supporters deserve a unified party" which indicated that the leadership tension influenced his decision to resign as party co-leader. Flavell replaced him as the party's male co-leader. In the 2014 general election, Marama Fox became the party's first list MP, and – as the party's only female MP – under the party rules automatically became female co-leader.

Following Rawiri Waititi's successful campaign for Waiariki at the 2020 New Zealand general election, he was confirmed as male co-leader, replacing John Tamihere, at a special general meeting of the Māori Party on 28 October.

The party also has a president:
Harvey Haddix, Jr. (September 18, 1925 – January 8, 1994) was an American professional baseball left-handed pitcher and pitching coach, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals (1952–1956), Philadelphia Phillies (1956–57), Cincinnati Redlegs (1958), Pittsburgh Pirates (1959–1963), and Baltimore Orioles (1964–65).

Haddix was born in Medway, Ohio, located just outside Springfield. He was nicknamed "The Kitten" in St. Louis for his resemblance to Harry "The Cat" Brecheen, a left-hander on the Cardinals during Haddix's rookie campaign.

Haddix is most notable for pitching 12 perfect innings in a game against the Milwaukee Braves on May 26, 1959; the Pirates lost the game in the 13th inning.

Haddix enjoyed his best season in 1953, pitching for the Cardinals. He compiled a 20-9 record with 163 strikeouts, a 3.06 earned run average (ERA), 19 complete games, and six shutouts. After five-plus seasons with the Cardinals, Haddix was traded to the Phillies. He also pitched for Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, and finished his pitching career as an effective reliever with the Orioles. Haddix was on the Pirate team that won the 1960 World Series, and was the winning pitcher of Game Seven, pitching in relief as the Pirates’ Bill Mazeroski clubbed a  walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth.

Near-perfect game

Haddix took a perfect game into the 13th inning against the Milwaukee Braves on May 26, 1959. He retired 36 consecutive batters in 12 innings, essentially relying on two pitches: fastball and slider. However, Braves pitcher Lew Burdette was also pitching a shutout, which was seriously jeopardized on only three occasions: the 3rd inning, when a base-running blunder negated three consecutive singles; the 9th, when Pittsburgh finally advanced a runner as far as third base; and the 10th, when pinch hitter Dick Stuart came within a few feet of ending Burdette's shutout bid with a two-run homer.

A fielding error by third baseman Don Hoak ended the perfect game in the bottom of the 13th, with the leadoff batter for Milwaukee, Félix Mantilla, reaching first base.  Mantilla then advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Eddie Mathews, which was followed by an intentional walk to Hank Aaron. Joe Adcock then hit an apparent home run, ending the no-hitter and the game. However, in the confusion, Aaron left the basepaths and was passed by Adcock for the second out and the Braves won 2-0.  Eventually the hit was changed from a home run to a double by a ruling from National League (NL) president Warren Giles; ultimately, only Mantilla's run counted, resulting in a final score of 1-0, but the Pirates and Haddix still lost.

Haddix's -inning, one-hit complete game, against the team that had just represented the NL in the previous two World Series, is considered by many to be the best pitching performance in MLB history. Mazeroski later said of Haddix's dominance in the game, "Usually you have one or two great or spectacular defensive plays in these no-hitters. Not that night. It was the easiest game I ever played in."

After the game, Haddix received many letters of congratulations and support, as well as one from a Texas A&M fraternity which read, in its entirety on university stationery, "Dear Harvey, Tough shit." "It made me mad", recounted Haddix, "until I realized they were right. That's exactly what it was."

In 1991, Major League Baseball changed the definition of a no-hitter to "a game in which a pitcher or pitchers complete a game of nine innings or more without allowing a hit." This retroactively disqualified Haddix, which some had considered to have thrown a perfect game because he retired the first 27 batters in order. Despite his having thrown more perfect innings than anyone in a single game, Haddix's game was taken off the lists of perfect games and no-hitters. Haddix's response was "It's O.K.  I know what I did."

In May 1989, Milwaukee's Bob Buhl revealed that the Braves pitchers had been stealing signs from Pittsburgh catcher Smokey Burgess, who was exposing his hand signals due to a high crouch. From their bullpen, Braves pitchers repeatedly repositioned a towel to signal for a fastball or a breaking ball, the only two pitches Haddix used in the game. Despite this assistance, the Milwaukee offense managed just one hit. All but one Milwaukee hitter, Aaron, took the signals.

Career
Over his 14-year career, Haddix had a 136-113 record with 1,575 strikeouts, a 3.63 ERA, 99 complete games, 21 shutouts, 21 saves, and 2,235 innings pitched in 453 games (285 as a starter). He was in the spotlight in the 1960 World Series against the Yankees. After winning Game 5 as a starter, Haddix relieved late in Game 7 and was credited with the win when Bill Mazeroski hit his Series-ending famous walk-off home run. Haddix went 2-0 in the 1960 Series, with a 2.45 ERA.

As a hitter, Haddix was better than average, posting a .212 batting average (169-for-798) with 95 runs, 37 doubles, 9 triples, 4 home runs, 64 RBI, 4 stolen bases and 46 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .957 fielding percentage which was the league average at his position.

Jim Palmer said he learned a lot about pitching from Haddix during the veteran's time with the Orioles.

Haddix later followed his namesake Brecheen into the ranks of major league pitching coaches, working with the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, and Pirates for 14 years spanning 1966 to 1984.

Death
He died from emphysema in 1994 in Springfield, Ohio, at the age of 68.

Tributes
Haddix's near-perfect game is memorialized by The Baseball Project, whose song, "Harvey Haddix", appears on their debut album, Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails (2008).

Haddix Field, the Little League baseball park in New Carlisle, Ohio, is named for Haddix.
The Will Rogers Follies is a musical with a book by Peter Stone, lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and music by Cy Coleman.

It focuses on the life and career of famed humorist and performer Will Rogers, using as a backdrop the Ziegfeld Follies, which he often headlined, and describes every episode in his life in the form of a big production number.  The Rogers character also performs rope tricks in between scenes.  The revue contains snippets of Rogers' famous homespun style of wisdom and common sense and tries to convey the personality of this quintessentially American figure whose most famous quote was "I never met a man I didn't like."

Productions
After thirty-three previews, the Broadway production opened on May 1, 1991, at the Palace Theatre, and closed on September 5, 1993 after 981 performances. Directed and choreographed by Tommy Tune, the original cast included Keith Carradine as Rogers, Dee Hoty as Betty Blake, Dick Latessa as Will's father Clem, and Cady Huffman as Ziegfeld's favorite chorus girl. Replacements later in the run included Mac Davis and Larry Gatlin as Rogers, Mickey Rooney as Clem, and Susan Anton and Marla Maples as Ziegfeld's favorite chorus girl. The recorded voice of Gregory Peck was heard as Ziegfeld.

The original choice of the authors to play Will Rogers was John Denver, but, due to a perceived insult from librettist Peter Stone, Denver bowed out of consideration for casting.

The show also enjoyed a number of national tours, with Carradine, Davis, and Gatlin in the first National tour in 1993 and 1994.  Pat Boone starred in the musical in Branson, Missouri in 1994.  The role of Betty (his wife) was played by Marylee Graffeo(Fairbanks). Variety noted that "Broadway Came To Branson with the bow of the 'Will Rogers Follies: A Life in Review' in the new Will Rogers Theater last Saturday...Pat Boone is a solid hit in Branson as Will Rogers in the 'Follies.'" The music was not live but digitalized.

Synopsis
Act I

Rogers frequently speaks directly to the audience and to Florenz Ziegfeld himself, who often interjects to question the progress of the show and to give some directorial advice.  After introducing the audience to his friends and family, Rogers discusses leaving home at 19 to become a cowboy in Argentina.  Ziegfeld tells Rogers that he must "meet the girl".  Although Rogers met Betty Blake at a train station, Ziegfeld creates a more "theatrical" meeting by having her lowered romantically from the moon.

Because Betty is eager to marry Rogers, the show moves forward several years to a time when Rogers is playing in a small Wild West revue.  The couple is about to be married, but Ziegfeld interrupts, saying that the wedding has to be delayed, because it must occur in the first act finale.  So, as Rogers' success continues to grow, he and Betty travel around the country performing and produce four children.  Rogers gets his big break when he is invited to join the Ziegfeld Follies and, by the early 1910s, he is a big vaudeville and radio star.  He is about to leave for Hollywood to start a career in film, when it is at last time for the finale and the wedding.

Act II

Rogers is at the zenith of his popularity, the country's biggest and highest paid star of every medium of his time– stage, screen, radio, newspapers, and public appearances– and is even asked to run for president.  This doesn't leave him much time for Betty, and she begins to feel neglected and starts singing the blues.  Rogers comes home with "a treasury of precious jewels," and all is forgiven.  The good mood doesn't last long, however, as bill collectors and creditors come knocking at the door.  Ziegfeld has lost his fortune, and the Great Depression is in full swing.  Herbert Hoover asks Rogers to give a speech to the nation, and everyone is inspired.  Rogers also reconciles with his estranged father.  The show ends with the tragic plane ride in Alaska that he shares with Wiley Post, a character whose cheerful invitation, "Let's go flyin' Will!" is heard throughout the show.

Awards and nominations

Original Broadway production
Moses Ilyich Schönfinkel (29 September 1888 – 1942) was a logician and mathematician, known for the invention of combinatory logic.

Life
Moses Schönfinkel was born in 1888 in Ekaterinoslav, Russian Empire (now Dnipro, Ukraine). Moses Schönfinkel was born to a Jewish family. His father was Ilya Girshevich Schönfinkel, a merchant of first guild, who was in а grocery store trade, and  his mother, Maria “Masha” Gertsovna Schönfinkel (née Lurie) came from a prominent Lurie family. Moses had siblings named Deborah, Natan, Israel and Grigoriy. Schönfinkel attended the Novorossiysk University of Odessa, studying mathematics under Samuil Osipovich Shatunovskii (1859–1929), who worked in geometry and the foundations of mathematics. From 1914 to 1924, Schönfinkel was a member of David Hilbert's group at the University of Göttingen in Germany. On 7 December 1920 he delivered a talk entitled Elemente der Logik ("Elements of Logic") to the group where he outlined the concept of combinatory logic. Heinrich Behmann, a member of Hilbert's group, later revised the text and published it in 1924. In 1928, Schönfinkel had one other paper published, on special cases of the decision problem (Entscheidungsproblem), that was prepared by Paul Bernays.

After he left Göttingen, Schönfinkel returned to Moscow. By 1927 he was reported to be mentally ill and in a sanatorium. His later life was spent in poverty, and he died in Moscow some time in 1942. His papers were burned by his neighbors for heating.

Work
Schönfinkel developed a formal system that avoided the use of bound variables. His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators B, C, I, K, S and a combinator for a universally quantified nand function which he called U. Schönfinkel stated that the system could be reduced to just K, S, and U (a colleague stated that U could be factored to the end of any expression and thus not always explicitly written) and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same power as predicate logic.

His paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument. This replacement mechanism simplifies work in both combinatory logic and lambda calculus and would later be called currying, after Haskell Curry. While Curry attributed the concept to Schönfinkel, it had already been used by Frege (an example of Stigler's law).

The complete known published output of Schönfinkel consists of just two papers: his 1924 On the Building Blocks of Mathematical Logic, and another, 31-page paper written in 1927 and published 1928, coauthored with Paul Bernays, entitled Zum Entscheidungsproblem der mathematischen Logik (On the Decision Problem of Mathematical Logic).

TIAA Bank Field is an American football stadium located in Jacksonville, Florida, that primarily serves as the home facility of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) and the headquarters of the professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW). 

The stadium opened in 1995 as Jacksonville Municipal Stadium on the site of the old Gator Bowl Stadium (erected 1927), and included some portions of the older stadium. Located on the St. Johns River, it sits on  of land in downtown Jacksonville. In addition to hosting the Jaguars, the stadium is regularly used for college football, concerts, and other events. It is the regular site of the annual Florida–Georgia game, a college football rivalry game between the University of Florida and the University of Georgia. The stadium is also the home of the annual Gator Bowl, a post-season college bowl game. Additionally, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005 and is one of the venues used by the United States men's national soccer team.

From 1997 to 2006, the stadium was named Alltel Stadium after communications company Alltel purchased naming rights. The facility was renamed EverBank Field in 2010, following the approval of a five-year, naming rights deal with the financial services company EverBank. The agreement was extended in 2014 for an additional 10 years. The Jaguars announced in February 2018 the stadium would be renamed TIAA Bank Field for the 2018 NFL season after EverBank was acquired by New York-based TIAA.

The stadium temporarily played host to the New Orleans Saints during the 2021 NFL season after the team was forced to relocate from Caesars Superdome, owing to the aftermath of Hurricane Ida.

Construction
TIAA Bank Field is located in the Stadium District of downtown Jacksonville, which has been home to football fields since the early 20th century. In 1928 the first permanent football stadium, Fairfield Stadium, was constructed. In 1948 this was expanded and renamed Gator Bowl Stadium, in honor of the annual Gator Bowl game first played two years earlier.

The current structure was built using a few portions of the historic Gator Bowl Stadium. However, all of the elements included from the older stadium — the pedestrian ramp system and the more recent West Upper Deck section of the complex — dated back only to 1982. Construction started January 3, 1994, and the new stadium opened on August 18, 1995, with an exhibition game with the St. Louis Rams. Total construction time was under 20 months and total cost was US$134 million – $60 million of which was provided by the city of Jacksonville.

Planning
In January 1993, representatives from the University of Florida and University of Georgia began negotiating with Jacksonville representatives to renew the contract to host the Florida–Georgia game, the annual rivalry game between the college football teams of the two universities. The universities' five-year contract with the Gator Bowl ended after the 1994 game, and the Citrus Bowl had offered Florida and Georgia a larger sum of money than the Gator Bowl for the right to host the game.

To counter the Citrus Bowl's larger monetary offer, Jacksonville mayor Ed Austin proposed a $25.5 million renovation plan to Jacksonville's aging Gator Bowl Stadium, which had been built in 1949. Both teams had expressed concerns about the condition of the aging stadium, and renovations were considered key to enticing the teams to keep returning to Jacksonville, bringing tens of millions of dollars in consumer spending with them. Despite the promise of renovations, Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley was unswayed, so Austin widened the scope of the renovations, increasing their price tag to $49 million, and traveled to Athens, Georgia, to talk with Dooley in person. Austin's campaigning was partially successful. On March 23, 1993, the two universities announced they had signed a five-year contract with the Gator Bowl, running from 1997 to 2002. The contract was contingent on Austin successfully passing the $49 million renovation bond issue through the Jacksonville City Council and the city completing the renovations by the 1996 game. On Tuesday, May 11, the Jacksonville City Council approved a $219.5 million bond issue, including the $49 million for the renovation of the Gator Bowl.

NFL expansion
Soon after the approval of the bond issue, investors interested in attracting a new National Football League team to Jacksonville requested that another $30 million be added to the $49 million renovations in order to make the stadium more attractive for a professional team. That number climbed higher throughout the summer, and eventually the city reached an agreement with the leading group of investors hoping to attract an NFL team to Jacksonville. On July 1, the city and investors reached a lease agreement contingent on the city investing $112.3 million for improving the Gator Bowl. The lease agreement later collapsed when the Jacksonville City Council voted to send the lease back to a committee for further study rather than approving it. One month after the proposed deal fell through, city officials and investors tried again and were successful in negotiating a deal that included a pledge to spend $121 million on renovations to the Gator Bowl. Due to the expanded renovations, it was announced that the 1994 Florida-Georgia game would have to be moved out of the Gator Bowl, as had the 1995 game, in order to provide time for the newly expanded renovation plan to be completed before 1996. In the end, the expanded bond issue and renovation program proved to be successful, as Jacksonville was awarded the 30th NFL franchise—the Jacksonville Jaguars—on November 30, 1993.

Almost as soon as the celebration surrounding Jacksonville's new NFL team died down, however, a renovation contractor's plan to give 8% of the stadium work to minority-owned businesses drew criticism. The NAACP and another group said African-American businesses should have been awarded twice that amount of work.

Current stadium

The stadium's re-opening day was also the home debut of the Jaguars during the 1995 NFL season. It was the first time that an expansion NFL team had played its first game in a new facility; they played the Houston Oilers in the opener and lost 10–3. The Gator Bowl returned as a New Year's Day bowl game on January 1, 1996, following the 1995 NCAA season.

The stadium contains 11,200 club seats, 88 luxury suites, and a "super suite".

In 1997, the stadium changed its name to Alltel Stadium after naming rights were acquired by Alltel, a telecommunications company best known as a wireless carrier. The name Alltel Stadium stopped being used by the city after January 2007 when the contract expired; by that point, most of Alltel's assets had been purchased by Verizon.

In 2005, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXIX in which the New England Patriots defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–21 in front of 78,125, the largest Super Bowl in attendance since 1994. Paul McCartney performed at halftime, performing Beatles classics "Drive My Car", "Get Back", and "Hey Jude", as well as a firework-filled "Live and Let Die". In 2003 and 2004, $47 million in improvements to the stadium were implemented to prepare for the Super Bowl. These improvements included the addition of a unique sports bar in the south end zone called the "Bud Zone", a larger and wider video and scoring display from Daktronics, escalators in the north and south end zone, and a new "terrace suite" called the "Sky Patio" right above the "Bud Zone" in the south end zone.

Before the 2005 season, mainly due to low attendance figures and looming blackouts, team officials installed a series of tarps to reduce the seating capacity for Jaguars games. The covers were placed to block out seven sections in the upper north end zone and four in each upper deck section, located on the corners of each. This puts 9,703 seats out of service, leaving the stadium with 66,851 seats for the regular season.  However, in the event the Jaguars make the AFC Championship Game, the stadium can easily be expanded to full capacity.  Some believed that this was a sign that the city couldn't support an NFL team; the city is the second-smallest market in the league.  However, the current capacity is actually very close to what Wayne Weaver included in his original proposal to bring the Gator Bowl up to NFL standards.  The city council turned this plan down, mainly out of concern for not having enough seats to accommodate the annual Florida-Georgia game.

Despite the changes, however, blackouts have still occurred, including two of their first three home games in 2007 and nine of ten games in 2009. It is believed that the 2008 US financial crisis played a major part in the 2009 season blackouts, leading to insufficient ticket sales, with only the final home engagement of the regular season, with the Indianapolis Colts, managing to sell out. However, the Jaguars' 2010 season saw a huge turnaround in ticket sales, with no games being blacked out that year. The Jaguars avoided blackouts in all games in 2011 and 2012.

For the Super Bowl, Florida–Georgia game, and occasionally the Gator Bowl, temporary bleachers are put up in the south end zone and the tarps are removed, raising capacity to over 84,000.

The attendance record was set on September 29, 2007, when 85,413 watched Florida State defeat Alabama in what was dubbed the River City Showdown. Each school received nearly 36,000 tickets, and the Gator Bowl Association added 5,800 seats.

On July 26, 2010, naming rights to the stadium were bought by EverBank, one of the nation's largest privately held bank holding companies with approximately $11.2 billion in assets. On August 10, the deal was officially approved by the Jacksonville City Council with a 14–3 vote.

In November 2013, Jacksonville's City Council approved $63 million in improvements to EverBank Field. Jaguars owner Shahid Khan helped finance $20 million of the cost. Renovations included two end zone video scoreboards  long that are the largest HD LED of their kind in the world, a platform area in the north end zone with two wading pools, unique food and beverage offerings, interactive activities, and  of HD video screens, which is a world record for a stadium. Construction of the platform resulted in the removal of approximately 7,000 seats, though temporary seating can be installed for major events that will require a larger stadium capacity. During the construction a live webcam was set up to view the progress of the new video scoreboards. The scoreboards were publicly unveiled on July 26, 2014.

In the middle of 2016, the Jaguars and the city of Jacksonville announced $90 million in improvements to the stadium. Phase 1 includes the improvements to club seating, sponsored by US Assure, new walkout patios at the 50-yard-line and the creation of a new south end zone tunnel that will be the new team entrance and create two new seating environments. Phase 2 includes the construction of an amphitheater (Daily's Place) and a covered flex field; both phases were completed in May 2017.

After the successful 2017 season which saw the Jaguars return to the playoffs for the first time since the 2007 season and host a playoff game for the first time since 1999, the Jaguars announced the removal of the last of the tarps on the upper levels. The removal adds 3,501 seats to the capacity of the stadium bringing total capacity to 67,814.

The stadium is planned to undergo wholesale renovations around 2025 and 2026 that would downsize capacity to below 60,000. This could force the Jaguars, the Gator Bowl, and the Florida–Georgia game to temporarily play elsewhere during the reconstruction.

Motorpsycho is a Norwegian rock band from Trondheim. Their music can generally be defined as progressive or psychedelic rock, but they also mix in elements from alternative, jazz, post-rock, pop, country and many other musical styles. The members of the band are Bent Sæther (born 18 February 1969, bass/vocals), Hans Magnus "Snah" Ryan (born 31 December 1969, guitar/vocals) and Tomas Järmyr (drums). Until March 2005, Håkon Gebhardt (born 21 June 1969) was the band's drummer. From December 2007 to May 2016 Kenneth Kapstad was the drummer of the band, being replaced by Tomas Järmyr, who joined in early 2017. Järmyr left the band in January 2023.

Biography 
Formed in the late 1980s as an alternative metal band (they picked their name after seeing the Russ Meyer film of the same name as part of a Russ Meyer triple bill – there was already a band named after Mudhoney and a band named after Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! – the other two films on the bill), Motorpsycho soon developed a unique blend of grunge, heavy metal and indie rock, as well as incorporating the sonic noise experiments of associated member Deathprod. The hugely ambitious, progressive double album Demon Box (1993) followed a series of low-profile EPs and albums, earning the band a nomination for a Norwegian Grammy, and secured a loyal following in Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as in Scandinavia.

The 1990s was an extremely productive era for the band, releasing new material almost every year, and enjoying critical acclaim for each album—if not the massive sales the music press kept predicting.

With the 2000 album Let Them Eat Cake, Motorpsycho suddenly took huge steps away from their noisy hard rock roots, opting instead for a smoother, jazz-tinged approach to the songwriting and recording process. They kept this technique for the subsequent releases, Phanerothyme and It's A Love Cult.

The double album Black Hole/Blank Canvas was released 17/20 March 2006 in Europe. The album received great reviews.

On 28 March 2008 Motorpsycho released an album entitled Little Lucid Moments, and on 16 March 2008 a DVD containing music videos, live footage and documentaries entitled Haircuts.

To celebrate their 20th anniversary, the band released a vinyl-only album, Child of the Future, recorded by Steve Albini at the beginning of August 2009.

In January 2010 Motorpsycho released the album Heavy Metal Fruit, their first album featuring an external producer, Kåre Vestrheim, and also their third album in under two years.

In October 2011 the Dutch venue Effenaar released a limited edition live album exclusively on vinyl entitled Strings Of Stroop – Motorpsycho Live At Effenaar. The album features four Motorpsycho tracks recorded during various Motorpsycho shows at Effenaar between 1999 and 2010. Only 500 copies were pressed and sold at the band's 14th show in the venue.

On 10 February 2012 Motorpsycho released the double CD/LP effort The Death Defying Unicorn in collaboration with keyboardist Ståle Storløkken from the free improv group Supersilent. The album is a reworking of an instrumental suite commissioned by and performed at Moldejazz 2010. During 2011, Sæther produced lyrics for a sweeping narrative, thus making the album version a concept album. As in its initial performance, the band and Storløkken are augmented by contributions from Trondheimssolistene, Trondheim Jazz Orchestra and violinist Ola Kvernberg. The core quartet performed the album in its entirety on every date during a March/April 2012 tour of Europe.

After the release and tour accompanying the Unicorn, the band felt the need to return to more traditional, guitar-based grounds and with Reine Fiske as second guitarist, recorded two albums, Still Life With Eggplant (released in spring 2013) and Behind the Sun (released in March 2014). To coincide with the release of Behind the Sun, Motorpsycho launched their first-ever official website, www.motorpsycho.no.

After years of institutionalising the band in Norway, Motorpsycho were inducted at Rockheim, Norway's rock music hall of fame, in a TV broadcast ceremony.

In 2016 the band released the studio album Here Be Monsters, which evolved from a piece of music they wrote for the Oslo Teknisk Museums birthday. The band played that special songs in the museum, with the help of Ståle Storløkken, and then decided to work on it in the studio.

In May 2016, after completing the European Here Be Monsters Tour, Kenneth Kapstad left Motorpsycho. Core members Sæther and Ryan spent the remainder of the year writing, rehearsing and performing a live score to the Carl Frode Tiller-written play Begynnnelser (eng. Beginnings) in a 38-date autumn run at Trøndelag Teater.

In a January 2, 2017, news update on their official home page, the band announced Swedish drummer Tomas Järmyr to be the third permanent member of Motorpsycho. Together, they have recorded The Tower in Los Angeles and Joshua Tree (at the famous recording studio, Rancho de la Luna), which was released on September 8 the same year.

On January 8, 2023, Järmyr left the band.

Kenneth Koch (27 February 1925 – 6 July 2002) was an American poet, playwright, and professor, active from the 1950s until his death at age 77.  He was a prominent poet of the New York School of poetry. This was a loose group of poets including Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery that eschewed contemporary introspective poetry in favor of an exuberant, cosmopolitan style that drew major inspiration from travel, painting, and music.

Life

Koch (pronounced coke) was born Jay Kenneth Koch in Cincinnati, Ohio.  He began writing poetry at an early age, discovering the work of Shelley and Keats in his teenage years. At the age of 18, he served in WWII as a U.S. Army infantryman in the Philippines.

After his service, he attended Harvard University, where he met future New York School poet John Ashbery. After graduating from Harvard in 1948 and moving to New York City, Koch studied for and received his Ph.D. from Columbia University.

In 1951, he met his first wife, Janice Elwood, at UC Berkeley; they married in 1954 and lived in France and Italy for over a year.  Their daughter, Katherine, was born in Rome in 1955 (In 1982, Katherine married poet Mark Statman, one of Koch's former students). In 1959, he joined the faculty in the Department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia and he taught classes at Columbia for over forty years.

His first wife died in 1981; Koch married his second wife, Karen Culler, in 1994. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1996.  Koch died from a year-long battle with leukemia in 2002.

Career
While a student at Harvard, Koch won the prestigious Glascock Prize in 1948. In 1962, Koch was writer in residence at the New York City Writer's Conference at Wagner College.

The 1960s saw his first published books of poetry, but his poetry did not garner wider popular acclaim until the 1970s with his book The Art of Love: Poems (1975). He continued writing poetry and releasing books of poetry up until his death. Koch won the Bollingen Prize for One Train (1994) and On The Great Atlantic Rainway: Selected Poems 1950-1988 (1994), followed closely by the Phi Beta Kappa Poetry Award winner New Addresses (2000).

In 1970, Koch released a pioneering book in poetry education, Wishes, Lies and Dreams: Teaching Children To Write Poetry.  Over the next 30 years, he followed this book with other books and anthologies on poetry education tailored to teaching poetry appreciation and composition to children, adults, and the elderly.

Koch wrote hundreds of avant-garde plays over the course of his 50-year career, highlighted by drama collections like 1000 Avant-Garde Plays (1988), which only contains 116 plays, many of them only one scene or a few minutes in length. His prose work is highlighted by The Red Robins (1975), a sprawling novel about a group of fighter pilots flying for personal freedom under the leadership of Santa Claus. He also published a book of short stories, Hotel Lambosa (1988), loosely based on and inspired by his world travels. He also produced at least one libretto, and several of his poems have been set to music by composers.

Koch taught poetry at Columbia University, where his classes were popular. His wild humor and intense teaching style, often punctuated by unusual physicality (standing on a table to shout lines by Walt Whitman) and outbursts of vocal performance often drawn from Italian opera, drew non-English majors and alumni. Some of the spirit of these lectures is contained in his final book on poetry education, Making Your Own Days (1998). His students included poets Ron Padgett, David Shapiro, Frank Lima, Alan Feldman, David Lehman, Jordan Davis, Jessy Randall, David Baratier, Loren Goodman, Carson Cistulli, and filmmaker Jim Jarmusch.

His poems were translated into German by the poet Nicolas Born in 1973 for the renowned "red-frame-series" of the Rowohlt Verlag.

Koch had a brush with the anarchist affinity group Up Against the Wall Motherfucker in early January 1968. During a poetry reading at St. Mark's Church, a member of the group walked in and pointed a handgun at the podium, shouting "Koch!" before firing one blank round. The poet regained his composure and said to the "shooter," "Grow up."

Poetry

Koch asked in his poem Fresh Air (1956) why poets were writing about dull subjects with dull forms.  Modern poetry was solemn, boring, and uneventful. Koch described poems  "Written by the men with their eyes on the myth/ And the missus and the midterms..." He attacked the idea that poetry should be in any way stale.

Koch wrote of how:

     The Waste Land gave the time's most accurate data,
     It seemed, and Eliot was the Great Dictator
     Of literature.  One hardly dared to wink
     Or fool around in any way in poems,
     And critics poured out awful jereboams
     To irony, ambiguity, and tension –
     And other things I do not wish to mention.
                    (Excerpt from ‘'Seasons on Earth',’ 1987)

Though not against T. S. Eliot, Koch opposed the idea that in order to write poetry one had to be depressed or think that the world is a terrible place. His ideas were developed with close friends Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery, along with painters Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers, among others. He once remarked that "Maybe you can almost characterize the poetry of the New York School as having as one of its main subjects the fullness and richness of life and the richness of possibility and excitement and happiness." In his poem The Art of Poetry (1975) Koch offered guidelines to writing good poetry. Among his 10 suggestions are "1) Is it astonishing?" and "10) Would I be happy to go to Heaven with this pinned on to my angelic jacket as an entrance show?  Oh would I?"

Koch once remarked that "Children have a natural talent for writing poetry and anyone who teaches them should know that."  In his poems:

He mixed word usage with various levels of imagery;
He set two contrasting tones next to each other, simplicity and silliness at the same time;
He spoke to everything, animate and inanimate objects;
He used parody of other poets to express his own views, both serious and comic.

Koch was labeled by some as just a comedic poet. He acknowledged this in an interview and offered his comments:

He gives a picture of this in "To Kidding Around," where the joys of being a joker are proclaimed:

     To be rid of troubles
     Of one person by turning into
     Someone else, moving and jolting
     As if nothing mattered but today
     In fact nothing
     But this precise moment...
               (Excerpt from To Kidding Around, 2000)

Theater

Koch collaborated with the composer Ned Rorem on an opera, Bertha, which received its premier in 1973.  His short play, George Washington Crossing the Delaware, was produced in 1962.  Numerous others of his plays have been produced.

Keeping up with the Joneses is an idiom in many parts of the English-speaking world referring to the comparison to one's neighbor as a benchmark for social class or the accumulation of material goods. To fail to "keep up with the Joneses" is perceived as demonstrating socio-economic or cultural inferiority. The phrase originated in a comic strip of the same name.

Origins

The phrase originates with the comic strip Keeping Up with the Joneses, created by Arthur R. "Pop" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in The New York World and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were unseen characters throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom keeping up with the Joneses has remained popular long after the strip's end.

The use of the name Jones to refer to metaphorical neighbors or friends in discussions of social comparison predates Momand's comic strip. In 1879, English writer E. J. Simmons wrote in Memoirs of a Station Master of the railroad station as a place for social exchange: "The Joneses, who don't associate with the Robinsons, meet there." American humorist Mark Twain made an allusion to Smith and Jones families with regard to social custom in the essay "Corn Pone Opinions", written in 1901 but first published in 1923. "The outside influences are always pouring in upon us, and we are always obeying their orders and accepting their verdicts. The Smiths like the new play; the Joneses go to see it, and they copy the Smith verdict." Starting in 1908, D.W. Griffith directed a series of comedy shorts starring The Biograph Girl, Florence Lawrence, featuring the people next door, The Joneses.

An alternative explanation is that the Joneses of the saying refer to the wealthy family of Edith Wharton's father, the Joneses. The Joneses were a prominent New York family with substantial interests in Chemical Bank as a result of marrying the daughters of the bank's founder, John Mason. The Joneses and other rich New Yorkers began to build country villas in the Hudson Valley around Rhinecliff and Rhinebeck, which had belonged to the Livingstons, another prominent New York family to whom the Joneses were related. The houses became grander and grander. In 1853, Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones built a 24-room gothic villa called Wyndcliffe described by Henry Winthrop Sargent in 1859 as being very fine in the style of a Scottish castle, but by Edith Wharton, Elizabeth's niece, as a gloomy monstrosity. The villa reportedly spurred more building, including a house by William B. Astor (married to a Jones cousin), a phenomenon later described as "keeping up with the Joneses". The phrase is also associated with another of Edith Wharton's aunts, Mary Mason Jones, who built a large mansion at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, then undeveloped. Wharton portrays her affectionately in The Age of Innocence as Mrs. Manson Mingott, "calmly waiting for fashion to flow north".

A slightly different version is that the phrase refers to the grand lifestyle of the Joneses who by the mid-century were numerous and wealthy, thanks to the Chemical Bank and Mason connection. It was their relation Mrs William Backhouse Astor, Jr who began the "patriarchs balls", the origin of "The Four Hundred", the list of the society elite who were invited. By then the Joneses were being eclipsed by the massive wealth of the Astors, Vanderbilts and others but the four hundred list published in 1892 contained many of the Joneses and their relations—old money still mattered.

Social effects
The philosophy of "keeping up with the Joneses" has widespread effects on some societies. According to this philosophy, conspicuous consumption occurs when people care about their standard of living and its appearance in relation to their peers.

According to Roger Mason, "the demand for status goods, fueled by conspicuous consumption, has diverted many resources away from investment in the manufacture of more material goods and services in order to satisfy consumer preoccupations with their relative social standing and prestige".

Social status once depended on one's family name; however,  social mobility in the United States and the rise of consumerism there both gave rise to change. With the increasing availability of goods, people became more inclined to define themselves by what they possessed and the quest for higher status accelerated. Conspicuous consumption and materialism have been an insatiable juggernaut ever since.

Inability to "keep up with the Joneses" might result in dissatisfaction, even for people whose status is high. This could possibly tie in to a concept/theory called the “hedonic treadmill.”

Economics and pursuing social status overlap for some where “keeping up with the Joneses“ results in "living above one's means".  One ostensible indicator of this is credit card debt - though that is a gross measure and does not take into account such factors as increasing individual incomes, declining interest rates, changes in laws and or credit policies, and attractive investment opportunities that may capture an individual‘s cash, who then relies on credit cards more heavily for basic living expenses.

In popular culture
In the 1936 book The Next 100 Years, Clifford C. Furnas writes that the phenomenon of Keeping up with the Joneses' ... is descended from the spreading of the peacock's tail."

In the United Kingdom, when Princess Margaret married the fashionable photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones in 1960, Wallis Simpson allegedly said: "At least we're keeping up with the Armstrong-Joneses".

Jones in the Fast Lane is a life simulation videogame developed and published by Sierra Entertainment in 1990. The game's name and goals are a play on the concept of keeping up with the Joneses.

The Temptations recorded the song "Don't Let The Joneses Get You Down" on their 1969 album Puzzle People. The phrase is also referenced in the 1977 song "Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)" by Waylon Jennings. The Canadian band Spirit of the West referenced the phrase in a song about disability in society with the title "(Putting Up With) The Joneses" on the 1990 album Save This House. The phrase is a line of the lyrics of the song "Life At The Top" by the band Bad English, included in their 1991 album Backlash. The phrase appears in the song "I Wanna Go Back" by Christian singer David Dunn on his 2017 album "Yellow Balloons".

The phrase is used as the title of a 2011–2014 Barbadian comedy-series and also a 2016 American film Keeping Up with the Joneses. The reality television show Keeping Up with the Kardashians takes it name from this phrase, replacing "Joneses" with "Kardashians".

The drum line of the Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps is referred to as "Jonz" with the same intent...that all other drums lines need to keep up with their performance and innovation.
In mathematics and theoretical physics, a tensor is antisymmetric on (or with respect to) an index subset if it alternates sign (+/−) when any two indices of the subset are interchanged. The index subset must generally either be all covariant or all contravariant.

For example,

holds when the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its first three indices.

If a tensor changes sign under exchange of each pair of its indices, then the tensor is completely (or totally) antisymmetric.  A completely antisymmetric covariant tensor field of order  may be referred to as a differential -form, and a completely antisymmetric contravariant tensor field may be referred to as a -vector field.

Antisymmetric and symmetric tensors

A tensor A that is antisymmetric on indices  and  has the property that the contraction with a tensor B that is symmetric on indices  and  is identically 0.

For a general tensor U with components  and a pair of indices  and  U has symmetric and antisymmetric parts defined as:

{|
|-
|  || || (symmetric part)
|-
|  || ||(antisymmetric part).
|}
 
Similar definitions can be given for other pairs of indices.  As the term "part" suggests, a tensor is the sum of its symmetric part and antisymmetric part for a given pair of indices, as in

Notation

A shorthand notation for anti-symmetrization is denoted by a pair of square brackets. For example, in arbitrary dimensions, for an order 2 covariant tensor M,

and for an order 3 covariant tensor T,

In any 2 and 3 dimensions, these can be written as

where  is the generalized Kronecker delta, and we use the Einstein notation to summation over like indices.

More generally, irrespective of the number of dimensions, antisymmetrization over  indices may be expressed as

In general, every tensor of rank 2 can be decomposed into a symmetric and anti-symmetric pair as:

This decomposition is not in general true for tensors of rank 3 or more, which have more complex symmetries.

Examples

Totally antisymmetric tensors include:

 Trivially, all scalars and vectors (tensors of order 0 and 1) are totally antisymmetric (as well as being totally symmetric).

Eskimo Joe are an Australian alternative rock band that was formed in 1997 by Stuart MacLeod, on lead guitar, Joel Quartermain, on drums and guitar, and Kavyen Temperley, on bass guitar and vocals, in East Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia.

The band has released five additional albums since their debut album Girl was released in 2001: A Song Is a City, released in 2004; Black Fingernails, Red Wine, released in 2006; Inshalla, released in May 2009; Ghosts of the Past, released on 12 August 2011; and Wastelands, released on 20 September 2013. Eskimo Joe have won eight ARIA Music Awards; in 2006, the band achieved four wins—from nine nominations—for work associated with Black Fingernails, Red Wine.

History

1995–1999: Early years
Eskimo Joe founders MacLeod and Temperley were school mates at John Curtin Senior High School. Temperley left school at sixteen to concentrate on writing music, moving into a share house with Simon Leach, who played bass guitar in a funk band called Carpet. The other members were his brother Stuart on drums and guitarist Joel Quartermain—all three were former students at Hollywood Senior High School. When Temperley joined Carpet they changed the name to Freud's Pillow. The band performed around Perth and Fremantle from 1995 to 1998, and released an EP Pleasure Puppy in 1997; MacLeod, although not a member, is credited with co-writing "Mr Hoek" on the EP. Despite their modest popularity, Quartermain and Temperley were unhappy with the band's musical style. While recording the EP, Temperley started jamming for a side project with MacLeod, writing several short and simple pop–punk songs. They auditioned a number of drummers and eventually settled on Quartermain, who they believed was more musical.

Formed as an alternative rock group in 1997 in East Fremantle, Eskimo Joe was initially a side project of Freud's Pillow, with MacLeod on guitar, Quartermain on drums and guitar, and Temperley on bass guitar and vocals. Eskimo Joe's first gig was in August 1997 at the University of Western Australia, in a local heat for the National Campus Band Competition—they proceeded to the state final in Perth and then the national final in Sydney. For winning the national final, they were awarded a place at the 1997 Livid Festival in Brisbane and a studio recording session in Sydney.

Freud's Pillow officially split within a few months of Eskimo Joes' win. Simon Leach eventually formed Little Birdy in 2002, while Stuart played drums for One Horse Town and later for The Bank Holidays. In April 1998, Eskimo Joe recorded their debut release the Sweater EP. Its title track, "Sweater", received significant airplay on national Australian radio station Triple J and reached No. 33 on the station's Hottest 100 of 1998.

After touring for numerous months, Eskimo Joe returned to the studio and, in 1999, issued a second EP, the self-titled Eskimo Joe. Two tracks, "Ruby Wednesday" and "Turn Up Your Stereo", were voted into the Triple J Hottest 100 of that year. The band were voted into the No. 2 position on the 'Brightest Hope' list by the readers of Rolling Stone (Australia).

1999–2001: Girl
Eskimo Joe signed with Universal Records' alternative offshoot Modular, in 1999. They recorded their debut album, Girl, with producer Ed Buller (Ben Lee, Pulp, Suede). It reached No. 29 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold. Tracks such as "Who Sold Her Out" and "Planet Earth" received airplay on Triple J, with the former reaching the top 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart and the latter listed at No. 31 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2001. Some tracks featured on TV series, The Secret Life of Us. Rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, compared the album to their earlier work, "The nonsensical songs about stereos, alcohol and farting were replaced by Beatlesque highly relatable songs about the ups and downs about the day-to-day life". The band's live shows began to incorporate keyboards and an extra guitar. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the band's single, "Wake Up", with a promotional clip by Ben Saunders, won the 'Best Video' category.

2002–2005: A Song Is a City
Despite Girl being a top 30 album and earning a gold record, Modular ended the band's contract. Eskimo Joe signed with Festival Mushroom Records in 2002. They recorded their second album, A Song Is a City, produced by Paul McKercher and mixed by Nick Launay, in 2003. Released in May 2004, it peaked at No. 2 and, by 2006, achieved double platinum status. For live shows, Quartermain switched to guitar and Paul Keenan – also from Fremantle – played drums, and Dan Bull played keyboards.  At the time of the album's release, Temperley explained: 

The lead single "From the Sea" reached the top 40 in March 2004, and was number-one on the Triple J Net 50. It was used as the backing track for a series of TV ads for the West Coast Eagles Football Club. "Smoke" was released as the second single and was listed in the top 5 on Triple J's Net 50 in May. The third single, "Older Than You", became their second top 50 ARIA Singles Chart hit after they performed it at the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 in October. At the ceremony, A Song Is a City won two awards for 'Producer of the Year' and 'Engineer of the Year' for both McKercher and Eskimo Joe.

DVD
In August 2005, the Eskimo Joe DVD was released with all the film clips for tracks from the Eskimo Joe EP and the first two albums, a feature-length documentary, a collection of live performances, and some rare tracks, including "Sweater". They won 'Best Group' at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for "Older Than You".

2006–2008: Black Fingernails, Red Wine
MacLeod arranged for the band to produce their third album, Black Fingernails, Red Wine, themselves, which "shifted the emphasis from the songs and their performance to an over-all sound". Its title track, "Black Fingernails, Red Wine", released in May 2006, which peaked at No. 6, became their first Top 10 single. The song also reached No. 1 on ARIA's digital track chart. The album followed in June and debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It spent 51 weeks in the Top 50 and achieved four times platinum status. Its second single, "Sarah", was issued in September and peaked at No. 12. The B-sides are live and acoustic versions of "Black Fingernails, Red Wine" and a cover of the Pixies' "Hey" recorded for Triple J's Like a Version collection. The third single "New York" was released early in 2007 and reached No. 26. The fourth single, "Breaking Up", in which the music video starred actress Teresa Palmer, attained the top 100.
 In August, "Black Fingernails, Red Wine", was issued as the band's debut United States single. The fifth Australian single, "London Bombs", was released in October as a digital only single. The song was awarded first place in the 'Performance Category' at the 2007 International Songwriting Competition. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006, Eskimo Joe were nominated for nine awards and won four. Black Fingernails, Red Wine won 'Producer of the Year' for Eskimo Joe and 'Engineer of the Year' for Matt Lovell, "Black Fingernails, Red Wine" won 'Single of the Year' and Eskimo Joe won Best Music DVD.

2009-2010: Inshalla
Their fourth studio album, Inshalla, was released in May 2009. The group had played tracks at gigs prior to its release, including the title track, "Inshalla". The term, insha'Allah is Arabic for 'God willing' which Temperley had heard during a visit to Egypt. According to Nimmervoll, "The album was put together in the same spirit, instead of the extremelely  focused record they had wanted with Black Fingernails, Red Wine with Inshalla Eskimo Joe let the songs and the music take them wherever they led". The lead single, "Foreign Land", was issued in April and peaked at No. 13. Inshalla became the band's second album to debut at No. 1, and remained in the charts for 17 weeks. It was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009 for 'Album of the Year'. The second single, "Losing Friends Over Love", released in June failed to chart. However, the third single, "Don't Let Me Down", which was released in September, reached No. 50.

2011: Ghosts of the Past
They recorded their fifth album, Ghosts of the Past, in February 2011 at The Grove Studios in Sydney and the new Wasteland Studios in O'Connor, which is owned by the band under their own label, Dirt Diamonds. In May, the group announced that Ghosts of the Past was due for release on 12 August. It has the band aiming for more honesty and less polish than "Inshalla". The album will contain 12 new songs. Some tracks include "Love Is a Drug", "Itch", "Running", "Speeding Car", "When We Were Kids" and "Gave It All Away". The first single from the album "Love Is a Drug" was first performed at 2011 Southbound Music Festival in Busselton and was released on iTunes on 24 June.

2012–2013: Wastelands
To record the band's sixth album, a fundraising campaign was launched in November 2012 through the Pozible website (a service also used by fellow Australian musician Clare Bowditch for her Big Hearted Business initiative)—Pozible is self described as "a crowdfunding platform and community-building tool for creative projects and ideas. It was developed to help people raise funds, realise their aspirations and make great things possible." As of 8 February 2013, the campaign had raised AUS$60,636 in pledges, with 12 hours to go, above the initial target of AUS$40,000. In its subscriber newsletter, the band revealed that:

The decision to crowd fund the new album has allowed the band to take a fresh approach with the new album and work unhindered to create the strongest possible new work. With all of the generosity and support the band has received, the campaign has been successful and the band are now looking forward to beginning work on the album in March.

The band also offered previews of the pre-production process for the sixth album on its official YouTube channel—the first preview was published on 17 December 2012, while subsequent video segments were published on 14 January 2013 and 28 January 2013.

Temperley revealed in a pre-album-release interview that the band felt "dusty" following the decreased popularity of Ghosts of the Past. He explained, "We needed a third party to come in so we could just be a band" and stated that the band was motivated to hire producer Burke Reid after he admitted that he was not a fan of their music. Temperley also provided insight into the album's musical influences, citing Leonard Cohen and stating, "I always refer back to the sounds I have always loved and for me Beck and LCD Soundsystem are where it's at." Two synthesizers that belonged to Temperley, a Jupiter 4 and a Roland Compurhythm 100, were used during the entire recording process.

The release of Wastelands on 20 September 2013 was accompanied by a livestreamed session (using the Soundrop app, part of the Spotify music website) consisting of a live chat and a performance of the new album.

2020–present: The World Repeats Itself Somehow
On 26 June 2020, Eskimo Joe released "Say Something", their first single in seven years.

In September 2021, the band announced their first greatest hits album, The World Repeats Itself Somehow, which was released on 10 December 2021.

Tours
In November 2006, Eskimo Joe played at the CMJ Music Festival in New York City, returning to Australia for Southbound in Western Australia and the Falls Festival in Victoria and Tasmania. They performed on all legs of the 2007 Big Day Out concerts. In July, they played at the Australian leg of Live Earth in Sydney. At the end of that month, they had a secret gig in Perth under a pseudonym, The Andy Callison Project, as a warm-up to their US tour. Joining Eskimo Joe's line-up for live shows were Lee Jones on keyboards and Shaun Sibbes on drums. In January 2008, Eskimo Joe performed in New York, Houston and Los Angeles as part of the annual G'day USA – Australia Week. Later that year, the group performed at both the East Coast and West Coast Blues & Roots Festivals (Byron Bay and Fremantle, respectively).

In March 2009, Eskimo Joe performed at the Sound Relief concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Sound Relief was a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland floods. Appearing with Eskimo Joe at the Sydney concert were, Coldplay, Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, Jet, Josh Pyke, Little Birdy, The Presets, Wolfmother, You Am I and additional artists. Prior to the benefit concert the band played in Perth as The Andy Callison Project.

On 22 August 2012, the band was announced as the opening act for the launch of the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival in Australia.

The 'Winter Warmer' tour was announced in late May 2013 and the band explained that they would be playing acoustically at intimate and unusual venues across Australia. The tour will consist of two-hour acoustic-based shows in which the band will reinterpret a selection of songs from every album in the band's history. Temperley stated: "We've got a few a new songs that we're going to try out acoustically with some re-working of old songs too.  We feel really lucky to have such a beautiful and unique venues to do this in."

To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Song Is A City album, described by Temperley as a "turning point for myself both personally and musically", Temperley announced a solo Australian tour in June 2014. Temperley explained, "I love it how the whole album works on just an acoustic guitar, and there are so many stories that now, from a safe distance, I’m ready to tell", in regard to the tour that will occur from July to September 2014. During the tour, Temperley will 
share the stories that influenced the songs and will also play cover versions of some songs that influenced the album.

Other activities
In April 2010, Eskimo Joe were announced as the 'number-one ticket-holder' for the Fremantle Football Club, replacing golfer Nick O'Hern. Quartermain joked that they may pen a club song: "We'll give it a crack. We're back here this winter writing our new record so, while we're at it, we may as well knock off a new theme song." The band held the honour until 2012, being replaced by Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith.

A National Office for Live Music was launched by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in July 2013; and, as of August 2013, Temperley is the state ambassador for Western Australia.

Kurt Alois Josef Johann von Schuschnigg (14 December 1897 – 18 November 1977) was an Austrian politician who was the Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 Anschluss with Nazi Germany. Although Schuschnigg accepted that Austria was a "German state" and that Austrians were Germans, he was strongly opposed to Adolf Hitler's goal to absorb Austria into the Third Reich and wished for it to remain independent.

When Schuschnigg's efforts to keep Austria independent had failed, he resigned his office. After the Anschluss he was arrested, kept in solitary confinement and eventually interned in various concentration camps. He was liberated in 1945 by the advancing United States Army and spent most of the rest of his life as part of the academia in the United States. Schuschnigg gained American citizenship in 1956.

Biography

Early life
Schuschnigg was born in Reiff am Gartsee in the Tyrolean crown land of Austria-Hungary (now in Trentino, Italy), the son of Anna Josefa Amalia (Wopfner) and Austrian General Artur von Schuschnigg, member of a long-established Austrian officers' family of Carinthian Slovene descent. The Slovene spelling of the family name is Šušnik.

He received his education at the Stella Matutina Jesuit College in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg. During World War I, he was taken prisoner at the Italian Front and held captive until September 1919. Subsequently, he studied law at the University of Freiburg and the University of Innsbruck, where he became a member of the Catholic fraternity A.V. Austria. After graduating in 1922, he practiced as a lawyer in Innsbruck.

Political career 
Schuschnigg first joined the right-wing Christian Social Party and in 1927 was elected to the Nationalrat, then the youngest parliamentary deputy. Suspicious of the paramilitary Heimwehr organisation, he established the Catholic Ostmärkische Sturmscharen forces in 1930. 

On 29 January 1932, the Christian Social chancellor Karl Buresch appointed Schuschnigg Minister of Justice, an office he retained in the cabinet of Buresch's successor Engelbert Dollfuss, and he also served as Minister of Education from 24 May 1933. As justice minister, he openly discussed the abolition of the parliamentary system and restored the death penalty. In March 1933, he and Chancellor Dollfuss took the occasion to dissolve the National Council parliament. After the socialist February Uprising of 1934, he pressed for the execution of several insurgents, earning him the reputation of an "assassin of the workers". He would later call his orders a "faux pas".

On 1 May 1934, Dollfuss had erected the authoritarian Federal State of Austria. After Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazi Otto Planetta during the July Putsch, Schuschnigg on 29 July was appointed Austrian chancellor. Like Dollfuss, Schuschnigg ruled mostly by decree. Although his rule was milder than that of Dollfuss, his Austrofascist policies were not much different from the policies of his predecessor. He had to manage the economy of a near-bankrupt state and to maintain law and order in a country which was forbidden, by the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, to maintain an army in excess of 30,000 men. At the same time, he had to also cope with armed paramilitary forces in Austria, which owed their allegiance not to the state but to various rival political parties. He also had to be mindful of the growing strength of the Austrian Nazis, who supported Adolf Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into Nazi Germany. His overriding political concern was to preserve Austria's independence within the borders imposed on it by the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which ultimately failed.

John Gunther wrote in 1936 of Schuschnigg: "It would not be too much to say that he is as much a prisoner of the Italians now [as he was during World War I]—if the Germans don't get him next week." His policy of counterbalancing the German threat by aligning himself with Austria's southern and eastern neighbours—the Kingdom of Italy under the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini and the Kingdom of Hungary—was doomed to failure after Mussolini had sought Hitler's support in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and left Austria under the increasing pressure of a massively rearmed Third Reich. Schuschnigg adopted a policy of appeasement towards Hitler and called Austria the "better German state", but struggled to keep Austria independent. In July 1936, he signed an Austro-German Agreement, which, among other concessions, allowed the release of imprisoned July Putsch insurgents and the inclusion of the Nazi contact men Edmund Glaise-Horstenau and Guido Schmidt in the Austrian cabinet. The Nazi Party remained banned; however, the Austrian Nazis gained ground and relations between the two countries deteriorated further. In reaction to Hitler's threats to exercise a controlling influence over Austrian politics, Schuschnigg publicly declared in January 1938:

There is no question of ever accepting Nazi representatives in the Austrian cabinet. An absolute abyss separates Austria from Nazism ... We reject uniformity and centralization. ... Christendom is anchored in our very soil, and we know but one God: and that is not the State, or the Nation, or that elusive thing, Race.Rumours concerning his involvement in the Von Trapp family’s rise to fame have also come to light. It’s rumoured that upon hearing the Von Trapp family sing over the radio, he invited them to perform in Vienna which greatly helped them in their rise to fame.

Anschluss

On 12 February 1938, Schuschnigg met Hitler in his Berghof residence in an attempt to smooth the worsening relations between their two countries. To Schuschnigg's surprise, Hitler presented him with a set of demands which, in manner and in terms, amounted to an ultimatum, effectively demanding the handing over of power to the Austrian Nazis. The terms of the agreement, presented to Schuschnigg for immediate endorsement, stipulated the appointment of Nazi sympathiser Arthur Seyss-Inquart as minister of security, which controlled the police. Another pro-Nazi, Dr Hans Fischböck, was to be named as minister of finance to prepare for economic union between Germany and Austria. A hundred officers were to be exchanged between the Austrian and the German armies. All imprisoned Nazis were to be amnestied and reinstated. In return, Hitler would publicly reaffirm the treaty of 11 July 1936 and Austria's national sovereignty. "The Fuhrer was abusive and threatening, and Schuschnigg was presented with far-reaching demands ..."<ref>Laurence Rees The Holocaust" - pp 111-112 -Penguin Viking 2017</ref>  According to Schuschnigg's memoirs, he was coerced into signing the "agreement" before leaving Berchtesgaden.

The president, Wilhelm Miklas, was reluctant to endorse the agreement but eventually did so. Then he, Schuschnigg and a few key Cabinet members considered a number of options:

1. The Chancellor resign and the President call on a new Chancellor to form a Cabinet, which would be under no obligation to the commitments of Berchtesgaden.
2. The Berchtesgaden agreement be carried out under a newly appointed Chancellor.
3. The agreement be carried out and the Chancellor remain at his post.

In the event, they decided to go with the third option.

On the following day, 14 February, Schuschnigg reorganised his cabinet on a broader basis and included representatives of all former and present political parties. Hitler immediately appointed a new Gauleiter for Austria, a Nazi Austrian army officer who had just been released from prison in accordance with the terms of the general amnesty stipulated by the Berchtesgaden agreement.

On 20 February, Hitler made a speech before the Reichstag which was broadcast live and which for the first time was relayed also by the Austrian radio network. A key phrase in the speech was: "The German Reich is no longer willing to tolerate the suppression of ten million Germans across its borders."

In Austria, the speech was met with concern and by demonstrations by both pro and anti-Nazi elements. On the evening of 24 February, the Austrian Federal Diet was called into session. In his speech to the Diet, Schuschnigg referred to the July 1936 agreement with Germany and stated: "Austria will go thus far and no further." He ended his speech with an emotional appeal to Austrian patriotism: "Red-White-Red (the colours of the Austrian flag) until we're dead!"  The speech was received with disapproval from the Austrian Nazis and they began mobilising their supporters. The headline in The Times of London was "Schuschnigg's Speech – Nazis Disturbed". The phrase "thus far and no further" was found "disturbing" by the German press.

To resolve the political uncertainty in the country and to convince Hitler and the rest of the world that the people of Austria wished to remain Austrian and independent of the Third Reich, Schuschnigg, with the full agreement of the President and other political leaders, decided to proclaim a plebiscite to be held on 13 March. But the wording of the referendum which had to be responded to with a "Yes" or a "No" turned out to be controversial. It read: "Are you for a free, German, independent and social, Christian and united Austria, for peace and work, for the equality of all those who affirm themselves for the people and Fatherland?"

There was another issue which drew the ire of the National Socialists. Although members of Schuschnigg's party (the Fatherland Front) could vote at any age, all other Austrians below the age of 24 were to be excluded under a clause to that effect in the Austrian Constitution. This would shut out from the polls most of the Nazi sympathisers in Austria, since the movement was strongest among the young.

Knowing he was in a bind, Schuschnigg held talks with the leaders of the Social Democrats, and agreed to legalise their party and their trade unions in return for their support of the referendum.

The German reaction to the announcement was swift. Hitler first insisted the plebiscite be cancelled. When Schuschnigg reluctantly agreed to scrap it, Hitler demanded his resignation, and insisted that Seyss-Inquart be appointed his successor. This demand President Miklas was reluctant to endorse but eventually, under the threat of immediate armed intervention, it was endorsed as well. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March, and Seyss-Inquart was appointed Chancellor, but it made no difference; German troops flooded into Austria and were received everywhere by enthusiastic and jubilant crowds.  On the morning after the invasion, the London Daily Mail's correspondent asked the new Chancellor, Seyss-Inquart, how these stirring events came about, he received the following reply: "The Plebiscite that had been fixed for tomorrow was a breach of the agreement which Dr. Schuschnigg made with Hitler at Berchtesgaden, by which he promised political liberty for National Socialists in Austria." 
On 12 March 1938, Schuschnigg was placed under house arrest.

 Prison and concentration camp 
After initial house arrest followed by solitary confinement at Gestapo headquarters, he spent the whole of World War II in Sachsenhausen, then Dachau. In late April 1945, Schuschnigg narrowly escaped an execution order by Adolf Hitler, with other prominent concentration camp inmates, by being transferred from Dachau to South Tyrol where SS-Totenkopfverbände guards abandoned the prisoners into the hands of some Wehrmacht officers, who freed them. They were then turned over to American troops on 4 May 1945. From there, Schuschnigg and his family were transported, along with many of the ex-prisoners, to the isle of Capri in Italy before being set free.

Later life
After World War II, Kurt Schuschnigg was forbidden from joining the ÖVP because the party wanted to distance itself from the Austrian dictatorship. Moreover, the ÖVP did not want to expect their social democratic coalition partner from this man, who after the civil war of 1934 had many social democrats killed as Minister of Justice. Schuschnigg emigrated to the United States, where he was sheltered at the chateau estate Vousier of the Desloge family in St. Louis and then became a professor of political science at Saint Louis University from 1948 to 1967. He became an American citizen in 1956.

In 1959, he lost his second wife, Vera Fugger von Babenhausen (née Countess Czernin), whom he married by proxy in Vienna on 1 June 1938. His first wife died in a car accident on 13 June 1935. 

Kurt Schuschnigg went back to Austria where he downplayed his time as chancellor dictator and tried to justify Austrofascism.

Schuschnigg died at Mutters, near Innsbruck, in 1977.

The Popular Movement is a royalist and traditionalist rural-focused political party in Morocco. It is a member of Liberal International. The party has a history of cooperating with two other parties with a liberal orientation, the National Rally of Independents and the Constitutional Union, since 1993.

History
The Popular Movement was founded in 1957 by the Berber tribal chief Mahjoubi Aherdane with help from Abdelkrim al-Khatib who founded later a splinter party (Mouvement populaire démocratique et constitutionnel) that became the Justice and Development Party. It was initially a rural party with conservative and tribal orientation, that unconditionally supported the monarchy and aimed at countering nationalist Istiqlal Party. Although the party has been dominated by Berber speakers, it has not developed a distinct Berber agenda.

The present party results from a 25 March 2006 merger between the main party which had kept the original name and two splinter parties, the National Popular Movement (Mouvement National Populaire) and the Democratic Union (Union démocratique).

The party is a full member of Liberal International, which it joined at the latter's Dakar Congress in 2003.

In the parliamentary election held on 27 September 2002, the party won 27 out of the total 325 seats. It improved its standing in the parliamentary election held on 7 September 2007, winning 41 out of 325 seats.

The party won 32 out of 325 seats in the parliamentary election held in November 2011, being the sixth party in the parliament.

Zuhayr bin Abī Sulmā, also romanized as Zuhair or Zoheir, was a pre-Islamic Arabian poet who lived in the 6th & 7th centuries AD. He is considered one of the greatest writers of Arabic poetry in pre-Islamic times. Zuhayr belonged to the Banu Muzaina. His father was a poet and his elder son Ka'b bin Zuhayr also became a poet, reading his works to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Zuhayr's poems can be found in Hammad Ar-Rawiya's anthology, the Mu'allaqat ("the Suspended"), a collection of pre-Islamic poetry. He was one of the seven poets featured in that collection who were reputed to have been honoured by hanging copies of their work in the Kaaba at Mecca. He was Umar ibn al-Khattab's favourite poet.

Zuhayr's poetry was written when two Arabic tribes ended a longstanding hostility. His poems deal with raids and other subjects of nomadic desert life. He also wrote satirical poems and poems about the glory of his tribe, but in his verses he was less satiric than most of his brother poets. He strove to express deep thoughts in simple words, to be clear and by his clear phrases to teach his people high and noble ideas. He was a man of rank and wealth, the foremost of a family noted for their poetic skill and religious earnestness.

Cultural reception 
Zuhayr's poetry inspired Saudi land artist Zahrah al Ghamdi's 2018 installation After Illusion which was shown as part of the Venice Biennale.
was a town located in Sanbu District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

Narutō Town was established on April 1, 1889 within Musha District. Musha District became part of Sanbu District from April 1, 1897. On October 1, 1954 Narutō expanded through the annexation of the neighboring villages of Ōtomi and Nangō, and the village of Midorimi on July 1, 1955.

On March 27, 2006, Narutō, along with the towns of Matsuo and Sanbu, and the village of Hasunuma (all from Sanbu District), was merged to create the city of Sanmu, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

As of November 1, 2005, (the last census data prior to the merger) the town had an estimated population of 24,677 and a population density of 525 persons per km2. The total area was 47.02 km2.
The  (from Portuguese: Golden Law), adopted on May 13, 1888, was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It was signed by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921), an opponent of slavery, who acted as regent to Emperor Pedro II, who was in Europe.

The Lei Áurea was preceded by the Rio Branco Law of September 28, 1871 ("the Law of Free Birth"), which freed all children born to slave parents, and by the Saraiva-Cotegipe Law (also known as "the Law of Sexagenarians"), of September 28, 1885, that freed slaves when they reached the age of 60. Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery.

Background 
Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves.

Text 
The text of the  was brief:

Analysis 

The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. However, it did not provide any support to either freed slaves or their former owners to adjust their lives to their new status: slave owners did not receive any state indemnification, and slaves did not receive any kind of compensation from owners or assistance from the state.

Before the abolition of slavery, slaves were prohibited from owning assets or receiving an education; but after being freed, former slaves were left to make their own way in the world. Without education or political representation, former slaves struggled to gain economic and social status in Brazilian society.

The  was authored by Rodrigo A. da Silva, then Minister of Agriculture (in the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira) and member of the Chamber of Deputies, and, after passing both houses of the National Assembly (Assembléia Geral), it was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921), who was Regent at the time, while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. 

The Golden Law was signed by the Princess Imperial and countersigned by Rodrigo A. da Silva, in his capacity as Minister of Agriculture. Princess Isabel (who was a staunch supporter of the abolitionist movement) was awarded the "Golden Rose" by Pope Leo XIII and Minister Rodrigo A. da Silva received honors from the Vatican, France and Portugal. In August 1888 Rodrigo A. da Silva went on to be chosen for a lifetime seat in the Senate of the Empire.

The  had other consequences besides the freeing of all slaves; without slaves and lacking workers, the plantation owners had to recruit workers elsewhere and thus organized, in the 1890s, the  ("Society for the Promotion of Immigration)". Another effect was an uproar among Brazilian slave owners and upper classes, resulting in the toppling of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic in 1889 – the  is often regarded as the most immediate (but not the only) cause of the fall of monarchy in Brazil.
The Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set (commonly abbreviated to HKSCS) is a set of Chinese characters – 4,702 in total in the initial release—used in Cantonese, as well as when writing the names of some places in Hong Kong (whether in written Cantonese or standard written Chinese sentences). It evolved from the preceding Government Chinese Character Set or GCCS. GCCS is a set of supplementary Chinese characters coded in the user-defined areas of the Big5 character set.  It was originally used within the Hong Kong Government and later used by the public.  It later evolved into Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set when the characters in the set were submitted to ISO-10646 for coding.

Development history 

Due to the inherent differences between standard written Chinese and written Cantonese, the Government of Hong Kong recognised the need for a standardised set of proprietary characters that would allow for the streamlining of electronic communication; at the time, the Big5 Chinese encoding scheme did not contain a vast majority of these characters (some were erroneously cross-listed with similar characters).

The Government Chinese Character Set or GCCS  was thus developed by the government.  The character set consists of Chinese characters commonly used in Hong Kong.  Some characters are Cantonese-specific, while some are alternative forms of characters.  The set is not well-organised and the characters are not closely examined.

Subsequently, the HKSCS-1999 (HKSCS 1999 specification) was developed. Following its acceptance, newer revisions were released in 2001 (adding 116 new characters) and in 2004 (adding 123 new characters), totalling 4,941 characters. 106 GCCS characters were removed in HKSCS-1999 as a result of unification, and their Big5 code points are reserved for compatibility. Retired "not verifiable" GCCS characters are found in UTC Sources (UTC-00877–UTC-00898), where they are sourced from Adobe-CNS1-1, an Adobe-CNS1 supplement implemented to support GCCS.

The HKSCS is encoded in Big5 (Big5-HKSCS, big5hk) and ISO 10646 (Unicode).  Starting from HKSCS-2004, all characters previously using the Private Use Area section of Unicode are remapped, with many of them reassigned to Extension B Block or Supplementary Ideographic Plane Compatibility Block.  However, to preserve compatibility with programs that generated PUA code points, the allocated code points are reserved, and no new characters will be mapped to PUA.

Version history
The HKSCS has gone through a few iterations.

The last edition of HKSCS to encode all of its characters in Big5 was HKSCS-2008, while the characters added in HKSCS-2016 are mapped to Unicode only (as a CJK Unified Ideographs horizontal glyph extension where appropriate).

Macao Supplementary Character Set
Similarly to Hong Kong's situation, there are also characters that are needed by Macao but included in neither Big5 nor HKSCS, hence, the Macao Supplementary Character Set was developed, building on HKSCS with additional Unicode-mapped characters. The first batch of 121 MSCS characters were submitted for addition to or horizontal extension in Unicode (as appropriate) in 2009, and the first final version of MSCS was established in 2020.

Compatibility

Operating systems

Microsoft Windows
In Microsoft Windows 98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, HKSCS support can be enabled using Microsoft's patch. In Microsoft's implementation, application using code page 950 automatically uses a hidden code page 951 table for the Big5 encoding of the HKSCS extensions. The table supports all code points in HKSCS-2001, except for the compatibility code points specified by the standard. In addition, the MingLiU font is altered using Microsoft's patch. This patch is known to create conflicts in applications such as Microsoft Office, or any application using fonts supporting simplified Chinese characters (e.g.: SimSun).  If the target environment contains custom font mapped to the code points affected by Microsoft's patch, the custom fonts can undo Microsoft's patch. Furthermore, the patch breaks EUDC Editor supplied with the affected versions of Windows.

Starting with Windows Vista, HKSCS-2004 characters are only supported as Unicode 4.1 or later. All characters are assigned standard, non-PUA codepoints. The characters are displayed with the MingLiU font, and these characters can be entered via the keyboard. The patch that provides Big5 encoding of HKSCS is unsupported in Windows Vista and later. A utility provided by Microsoft is available to convert HKSCS and Unicode PUA-encoded characters to Unicode 4.1 version.

In 2010, Microsoft published a HKSCS-2004 patch for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. It replaces Windows XP version of MingLiu, PMingLiu, and MingLiu_HKSCS (if HKSCS-2001 patch was applied) with Windows 7 version of MingLiu, PMingLiu and MingLiu_HKSCS. In addition, MingLiU-ExtB, MingLiU_HKSCS-ExtB and PMingLiU-ExtB fonts will be added onto target system. However, IME is not updated as it was in the case of HKSCS-2001 patch, and the fonts are from pre-release of Windows 7.

For earlier versions of the OS, HKSCS support requires the use of Microsoft's patch, or the Hong Kong government's Digital 21's utilities.

IBM
IBM assigns CCSID 5471 to the HKSCS-2001 Big5 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 5470 as the double byte component), CCSID 9567 to the HKSCS-2004 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 9566 as the double byte component), and CCSID 13663 to the HKSCS-2008 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 13662 as the double byte component), while CCSID 1375 (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 1374 as its double byte component) is assigned to a growing HKSCS code page, currently equivalent to CCSID 13663.

Linux
HKSCS support was added to glibc in 2000, but it has not been updated since then. HKSCS-2004 support is handled as Unicode 4.1 and later.

For freedesktop.org setup, AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni font fully supports HKSCS-2004 since 0.1-0.dot.1, with latest revision of HKSCS-2004 supported in version 0.1.20060903-1.

Modern desktop distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) include Arphic Technology's HKSCS-compliant UKai and UMing fonts out of the box when Traditional Chinese Language support is selected during installation. They can also be installed manually at a later time.

Mac OS
Mac OS X 10.0–10.2 supports HKSCS-1999. 10.3–10.4 supports HKSCS-2001. Some of the letters added to HKSCS-2004 is supported via Unicode PUA in OS X 10.4. Starting with OS X 10.5, all the HKSCS-2004 characters are supported via standard Unicode 4.1 code points.

Applications and the Web

Mozilla 1.5 and above supports HKSCS, with HKSCS-2004 support added into Gecko 1.8.1 code base. Unlike the above-mentioned patch, Mozilla uses its own code page table. However, the fix for bug 343129 does not support characters mapped to code points above Basic Multilingual Plane.

QT 3.x-based applications (e.g.: KDE) only support characters mapped to code points FFFF or lower. In QT4, characters outside BMP are supported via surrogates. Big5-HKSCS Text Codec supports HKSCS-1999 back in Qt-2.3.x, but it was too late in Qt development schedule to be officially included in the Qt-2.3.x series, so it was officially supported in Qt-3.0.1. HKSCS-2001 support was added in Qt-3.0.5.

GNOME supports HKSCS characters in Unicode ranges, except those mapped to the Basic Multilingual Plane compatibility block. Patches to support characters mapped to above Basic Multilingual Plane was introduced during Pango 1.1.

The WHATWG Encoding Standard (used by HTML5) includes HKSCS in its definition of Big5 (used even with the plain Big5 label). However, only its decoder uses all HKSCS extensions, while its encoder explicitly excludes those with lead bytes below 0xA1 (thus excluding most of the HKSCS extensions but including, for example, those inherited from Big5 ETEN). Newer browsers follow this standard, including Firefox.
, also known as Gate to Avalon,  is a 2001 Polish–Japanese science fiction drama film directed by Mamoru Oshii and written by Kazunori Itō. The film stars Małgorzata Foremniak as Ash, a player in an illegal virtual reality video game whose sense of reality is challenged as she attempts to unravel the true nature and purpose of the game. 

Avalon was filmed in Wrocław, Nowa Huta, the Modlin Fortress and Warsaw. The 2009 film Assault Girls that was written and directed by Oshii, is a stand-alone sequel set in the same fictional universe as Avalon.

Plot 

In a near future, many people are addicted to Avalon, a military-themed virtual reality shooter. In the game, solo players or parties raid levels populated with AI-controlled enemies and opposing players. Winners are rewarded with experience points and in-game money, which can be exchanged for cash, allowing skilled players to make a living. As their brains interact with the game directly, Avalon places significant mental strains on players, and has rendered players catatonic in many cases.

Ash is a famously skilled player, who only plays solo after her party Team Wizard was disbanded. After a Class A mission, the GM (Game Master) warns her of the next level's danger, and suggests she joins a party. The next day, Ash watches a Bishop-class character break her record time on the same mission. Intrigued, Ash tries but fails to learn about him or his avatar. As she leaves the game terminal, the Bishop player watches her.

Ash runs into a former teammate, Stunner, who mentions Murphy, her former team leader. As the two visit Murphy at a hospital, Stunner tells her Murphy went after a hidden NPC in Avalon, a young girl nicknamed "ghost". The girl is allegedly the only gateway into the rumored Special A, an extremely rewarding but incredibly challenging mission where players cannot "reset" (a mechanic allowing players to abort mission without their avatars being killed). Players who went after "ghost" never wake up from the game and became "Unreturned". As Ash walks through the corridor, a girl looking similar to "ghost" watches her. Ash looks at Murphy, who has now become comatose.

At home, Ash searches for words regarding Avalon, Unreturned, and the ghost. The search leads her to the "Nine Sisters", another Arthurian legend reference. Further researching and questioning the GM proves fruitless. Upon entering the game, Ash receives an invitation to a meeting, and is ambushed by a group of griefers, who lured her there to rob her equipment. After she overpowers a player, the group leader reveals that only the real Nine Sisters – Avalon's creators – know how to access Special A. They are interrupted by an attack helicopter which kills most of the players. Due to a lag, the helicopter's missiles teleport in front of Ash. She "resets" and leaves the game, narrowly avoiding losing her avatar. On the way home, Ash notices people around her are immobile, with the exception of a dog. At home, after she finishes preparing a meal for her dog, she realizes that it has disappeared. She hears the helicopter from the game flying pass.

The next day, Stunner meets Ash. He tells her of a high-level Bishop player who can make the ghost appear, and is sought out by parties seeking to enter Special A. Before becoming an Unreturned, Murphy himself was a Bishop player. At her house, Ash is visited by the Bishop player. He offers to form a party with her and she accepts. Ash arrives at the game terminal and tells the receptionist that she plans to enter Special A to look for Murphy. She enters the game, despite warnings from the receptionist and the GM.

In the game, Ash meets the Bishop player, whom she suspects is working for the Nine Sisters. Stunner arrives, revealing he has been helping Bishop recruit Ash all along. The party confronts the Citadel, an enormous boss. Stunner, Bishop and his summoned dummy players distract the giant, while Ash attacks its weak point. After the Citadel is destroyed, Stunner spots the ghost. He is then shot by an enemy. Before being forced out of the game, Stunner tells Ash of the only way to kill the ghost. Ash goes after the ghost and manages to kill it, turning it into a gateway. Ash steps into the gateway and disappears.

Ash "wakes up" from the game booth, which is put in her apartment, wearing civilian clothing and without equipment. Bishop contacts her and tells her she is in Class Real. The only way to exit the game is to complete the objective: defeat the Unreturned staying here. Ash takes the provided gun and proceeds to her destination, an Avalon-themed concert by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. On the way, she is stunned by the vibrant and bustling world, which is in stark contrast to the previous levels and to the world outside the game. At the concert hall, Ash sees Murphy, and they walk outside to talk. As she confronts Murphy about his decision to stay in the game, he states he prefers the "reality" within Avalon. Ash mortally wounds Murphy, who urges her to stay, then disappears. Ash enters the now empty concert hall, and sees the ghost on the stage. Ash trains her gun on the ghost, who flashes a smile. The text "Welcome to Avalon" is blended in.

Production 
Even though the film was produced and directed by a Japanese crew, it is a half European, half Asian work since Avalon was co-produced by a Polish film company, starred Polish actors and was filmed mostly in Warsaw and Modlin Fortress, Poland with Polish dialogue. A Japanese dub was created, however, for the film's original Japanese release and is available on the Japanese region 2 DVD.

"Shooting it in Japan was impossible," Oshii advised interviewer Andrez Bergen in a major article that appeared in Japan's Daily Yomiuri newspaper in 2004. "I didn't think of using a Japanese cast. I considered shooting in the UK or Ireland, but the towns and scenery in Poland matched my image for the movie."

According to Oshii, one of the advantages of shooting the film in Poland was that Polish Armed Forces were willing to lend their equipment (T-72 tanks and Mi-24 attack helicopters, among others) to the film makers without any additional fees.

In Europe, Avalon was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and won awards at other European festivals: in Spain, it was awarded "Best Cinematography" at the Catalan International Film Festival (2001), and in the United Kingdom, it won the "Best Film" award at Sci-Fi-London (2002).

However, the film received only limited release in North America (with most of its fanbase created via the circulation of bootleg DVDs imported from Asia) until Miramax released it on DVD in late 2003. The North American version has added narration to make it easier for the audience to understand the plot; although the option to view the film without the English overdubbing is provided, the subtitles still display the added dialogue. The British region-free DVD has literal English subtitles which explain the King Arthur connection better and does not display added dialogue.

Such viewer help was not used in European countries, like France, where local editions only feature optional subtitles about the Polish sung opera piece, in the Polish spoken original version only.

Video game 

In an unspecified era there is a forbidden online virtual reality video game. Players fight with modern, medieval and fantasy weapons in a world marked by war. In-game earned credits can be exchanged in real life for currency. Sometimes, usually with higher level players, a player's spirit may stay inside the game, and the body stays vegetating in hospitals in the real world.

Oshii describes his game as a "military RPG". However, it mixes elements of role-playing games (such as character classes and experience points) and first-person shooters (FPS) (utilizing real firearms such as semi-auto pistols (Walther PPK and Mauser C96), sniper rifle (Dragunov SVD) and rocket launcher (RPG-7)); and it also borrows from the Wizardry series Oshii played extensively during three years in which he was unemployed in the 1980s.

With these two genres, it shares the common principle of player hierarchy. In Avalon, players are ranked after three levels, Class C, Class B, Class A. Elite Class A players are rumored to be able to play a hidden extra mode featuring different rules and named Class SA (for "Special A").

To complete levels within the game, players must defeat powerful end-of-level bosses similar to those found in classic video games.

Players wear headsets which immerse their senses in the game world. The design of the headset and chair installation are influenced by the cult French science fiction short film La jetée. The headless statues also appear in this 1962 film.

As an interesting first, this film features the appearance of lag, a gameplay error due to network transfer slowdown often encountered in online games. Oshii displays lag as an ailment that causes physical convulsions in the player during these slowdowns.

The scene with Ash in the tramway is a live action recreation of a similar scene appearing in the 1999 anime feature film Jin-Roh, which Oshii wrote but did not direct. This scene is based on Oshii's own teenage experience, when he used to spend entire days spinning in loop in the Yamanote Line.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS or TNS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to reduce pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes which are typically conductive gel pads. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency, and intensity.  Generally, TENS is applied at high frequency (>50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (<10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction. More recently, many TENS units use a mixed frequency mode which alleviates tolerance to repeated use. Intensity of stimulation should be strong but comfortable with greater intensities, regardless of frequency, producing the greatest analgesia.  While the use of TENS has proved effective in clinical studies, there is controversy over which conditions the device should be used to treat.

Medical uses

Pain
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is a commonly used treatment approach to alleviate acute and chronic pain by reducing the sensitization of dorsal horn neurons, elevating levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine, and inhibiting glial activation. However, many systematic reviews and meta analyses assessing clinical trials looking at the effectiveness of using TENS to reduce different sources of pain have been inconclusive due to a lack of high quality and unbiased evidence. Potential benefits of TENS treatment include the safety, relative low cost, the ability to self-administer, and availability over the counter without a prescription. In principle, an adequate intensity of stimulation is necessary to achieve pain relief with TENS. An analysis of treatment fidelity (meaning that the delivery of TENS in a trial was in accordance with current clinical advice, such as using "a strong but comfortable sensation" and suitable, frequent treatment durations) showed that higher fidelity trials tended to have a positive outcome.

Acute pain 
For people with recent onset pain (less than three months) such as pain associated with surgery, trauma, and/or medical procedures, TENS may be better than placebo in some cases, however the evidence of benefit is very weak.

Musculoskeletal and neck/back pain 
There is some evidence to support a benefit of using TENS in chronic musculoskeletal pain. Results from a task force on neck pain in 2008, found no clinically significant benefit to TENS for the treatment of neck pain when compared to a placebo treatment. A 2010 review did not find evidence to support the use of TENS for chronic low back pain.

Another study examining Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) patients supported that TENS demonstrated a better efficacy and safety profile than Weak Opiates. Given the age and comorbidities of the KOA population being generally older, often prone to polypharmacy and sensitive to adverse reactions, TENS could be a relevant non-pharmacological therapeutic alternative to pharmacological analgesics for the management of Knee Osteoarthritis pain.

Neuropathy and phantom limb pain 
There is tentative evidence that it may be useful for painful diabetic neuropathy. As of 2015, the efficacy of TENS therapy for phantom limb pain is not known as no randomized controlled trials have been performed.

A few studies have shown objective evidence that TENS may modulate or suppress pain signals in the brain. One used evoked cortical potentials to show that electric stimulation of peripheral A-beta sensory fibers reliably suppressed A-delta fiber nociceptive (pain perception) processing. Two other studies used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): one showed that high-frequency TENS produced a decrease in pain-related cortical activations in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, while the other showed that low-frequency TENS decreased shoulder impingement pain and modulated pain-induced activation in the brain.

Labor and menstrual pain
Earlier studies have stated that TENS "has been shown not to be effective in postoperative and labour pain." These studies also had questionable ability to truly blind the patients. However, more recent studies have shown that TENS was "effective for relieving labour pain, and they are well considered by pregnant participants." One study also showed that there was a significant change in how soon the laboring mothers took to request pharmacologic pain management, like the epidural. The group with the TENS waited five additional hours. Both groups were satisfied with the pain relief that they had from their choices. No maternal, infant, or labor problems were noted. There is tentative evidence that TENS may be helpful for treating pain from dysmenorrhoea, however further research is required.

Cancer pain 
Non-pharmacological treatment options for people experiencing pain caused by cancer are much needed, however, it is not clear from the weak studies that have been published if TENS is an effective approach.

Bladder Function 
Percutaneous and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the tibial nerve have been used in the treatment of overactive bladder and urinary retention. Sometimes it is also done in the sacrum.
Systematic review studies have shown limited evidence on the effectiveness, and more quality research is needed. A major trial found that in a care home context transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation did not improve urinary incontinence.

Dentistry 
TENS has been extensively used in non-odontogenic orofacial pain relief. In addition, TENS and ultra low frequency-TENS (ULF-TENS) are commonly employed in diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). Further clinical studies are required to determine its efficacy.

Tremor 
A wearable neuromodulation device that delivers electrical stimulation to nerves in the wrist is now available by prescription. Worn around the wrist, it acts as a non-invasive treatment for those living with essential tremor. The stimulator has electrodes that are placed circumferentially around a patient's wrist. Positioning the electrodes on generally opposing sides of the target nerve can result in improved stimulation of the nerve. In clinical trials reductions in hand tremors were reported following noninvasive median and radial nerve stimulation.

Transcutaneous Afferent Patterned Stimulation (TAPS) is a tremor-customized therapy, based on the patient's measured tremor frequency, and is delivered transcutaneously to the median and radial nerves of a patient's wrist. The patient specific TAPS stimulation is determined through a calibration process performed by the accelerometer and microprocessor on the device.

The Cala ONE delivers TAPS in a wrist-worn device that is calibrated to treat tremor symptoms. Cala ONE received de novo FDA clearance in April 2018 for the transient relief of hand tremors in adults with essential tremor and is currently marketed as Cala Trio.

Contraindications 
People who have implanted electronic medical devices including pacemakers and cardiodefibrillators are not suggested to use TENS. In addition, caution should be taken before using TENS in those who are pregnant, have epilepsy, have an active malignancy, have deep vein thrombosis, have skin that is damaged, or are frail.

Side effects 
Overall, TENS has been found to be safe compared with pharmaceutical medications for treating pain. Potential side effects include skin itching near the electrodes and mild redness of the skin (erythema). Some people also report that they dislike the sensation associated with TENS.

TENS device types 
The TENS device acts to stimulate the sensory nerves and a small portion of the peripheral motor nerves; the stimulation causes multiple mechanisms to trigger and manage the sense of pain in a patient. TENS operates by two main mechanisms: it stimulates competing sensory neurons at the pain perception gate, and it stimulates the opiate response. The mechanism that will be used varies with the type of device.

The table below lists the types of devices:

History
Electrical stimulation for pain control was used in ancient Rome, in AD 63. It was reported by Scribonius Largus that pain was relieved by standing on an electrical fish at the seashore. In the 16th through the 18th centuries various electrostatic devices were used for headache and other pains. Benjamin Franklin was a proponent of this method for pain relief. In the 19th century a device called the electreat, along with numerous other devices were used for pain control and cancer cures. Only the electreat survived into the 20th century, but was not portable, and had limited control of the stimulus. Development of the modern TENS unit is generally credited to C. Norman Shealy.

Modern
The first modern, patient-wearable TENS was patented in the United States in 1974. It was initially used for testing the tolerance of chronic pain patients to electrical stimulation before implantation of electrodes in the spinal cord dorsal column. The electrodes were attached to an implanted receiver, which received its power from an antenna worn on the surface of the skin. Although intended only for testing tolerance to electrical stimulation, many of the patients said they received so much relief from the TENS itself that they never returned for the implant.

A number of companies began manufacturing TENS units after the commercial success of the Medtronic device became known. The neurological division of Medtronic, founded by Don Maurer, Ed Schuck and Charles Ray, developed a number of applications for implanted electrical stimulation devices for treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the nervous system.

Today many people confuse TENS with electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). EMS and TENS devices look similar, with both using long electric lead wires and electrodes. TENS is for blocking pain, where EMS is for stimulating muscles.

Research 
As reported, TENS has different effects on the brain. A randomized controlled trial in 2017 shown that sensory ULF-TENS applied on the skin proximally to trigeminal nerve, reduced the effect of acute mental stress assessed by heart rate variability (HRV). Further high quality studies are required to determine the effectiveness of TENS for treating dementia.

A head-mounted TENS device called Cefaly was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in March 2014, for the prevention of migraines. The Cefaly device was found effective in preventing migraine attacks in a randomized sham-controlled trial. This was the first TENS device the FDA approved for pain prevention, as opposed to pain suppression.

A study performed on healthy human subjects demonstrates that repeated application of TENS can generate analgesic tolerance within five days, reducing its efficacy. The study noted that TENS causes the release of endogenous opioids, and that the analgesia is likely due to opioid tolerance mechanisms.

The pain reduction ability of TENS is unconfirmed by sufficient randomized controlled trials so far. One meta-analysis of several hundred TENS studies concluded that there was a significant overall reduction of pain intensity due to TENS, but there were too few participants and controls to be entirely certain of their validity. Therefore, the authors downgraded their confidence in the results by two levels, to low-certainty.

Safety
There are several anatomical locations where TENS electrodes are contraindicated:
 Over the eyes due to the risk of increasing intraocular pressure
 Transcerebrally
 On the front of the neck due to the risk of an acute hypotension (through a vasovagal response) or even a laryngospasm
 Through the chest using anterior and posterior electrode positions, or other transthoracic applications understood as "across a thoracic diameter"; this does not preclude coplanar applications
 Internally, except for specific applications of dental, vaginal, and anal stimulation that employ specialized TENS units
 On broken skin areas or wounds, although it can be placed around wounds
 Over a tumor/malignancy (based on in vitro experiments where electricity promotes cell growth)
 Directly over the spinal column

TENS used across an artificial cardiac pacemaker (or other indwelling stimulator, including across its leads) may cause interference and failure of the implanted device. Serious accidents have been recorded in cases when this principle was not observed. A 2009 review in this area suggests that electrotherapy, including TENS, is "best avoided" in patients with pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). They add that "there is no consensus and it may be possible to safely deliver these modalities in a proper setting with device and patient monitoring", and recommend further research. The review found several reports of ICDs administering inappropriate treatment due to interference with TENS devices, but notes that the reports on pacemakers are mixed: some non-programmable pacemakers were inhibited by TENS, but others were unaffected or auto-reprogrammed.

The use of TENS is likely to be less effective on areas of numb skin or decreased sensation due to nerve damage. It may also cause skin irritation due to the inability to feel currents until they are too high. There is an unknown level of risk when placing electrodes over an infection (possible spreading due to muscle contractions), but cross contamination with the electrodes themselves is of greater concern. TENS should also be used with caution in people with epilepsy or pregnant women; do not use over area of the uterus as the effects of electrical stimulation over the developing fetus are not known.
The Indefatigable class were the second class built of British battlecruisers which served in the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy during World War I. The design represented a modest reworking of the preceding , featuring increased endurance and an improved cross-deck arc of fire for their midships wing turrets achieved by a lengthening of the hull. Like its predecessor, the design resembled the contemporary dreadnought of the Royal Navy, but sacrificed armour protection and one turret from the main battery for a  speed advantage.

Originally  was the only ship of the class, but  and  were later built as part of a scheme to improve the defence of the Dominions by having each Dominion purchase a 'fleet unit' of one battlecruiser, three light cruisers and six destroyers. Only Australia fully acceded to the idea, forming the Royal Australian Navy, but New Zealand agreed to fund one battlecruiser. A modified Indefatigable design was chosen rather than the  then building for the Royal Navy.

They spent most of the war patrolling the North Sea, and participated in most of the battles there, although only New Zealand was in the United Kingdom when the war began. Indefatigable was in the Mediterranean where she pursued the German warships  and  as they fled towards Turkey and Australia was flagship of the Royal Australian Navy in Australian waters where she helped to secure the German Pacific colonies and searched, unsuccessfully, for the German East Asia Squadron before sailing for the United Kingdom in December 1914. New Zealand participated in a number of the early actions in the North Sea including the Battle of Heligoland Bight and the inconclusive Scarborough Raid. Australia was still under repair after a collision with New Zealand before the Battle of Jutland so only Indefatigable and New Zealand were present when the former was destroyed by a magazine explosion. Both Australia and New Zealand spent much uneventful time at sea after Jutland waiting for the next appearance of the High Seas Fleet, but that had been forbidden by the Kaiser. New Zealand conducted Admiral Jellicoe on his tour of India and the Dominions after the war while Australia returned home where she again became the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy. New Zealand was sold for scrap in 1922 while Australia only lasted two years more before being scuttled to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

Background
Indefatigable was the successor to the Invincible-class battlecruisers. A number of options for large cruisers were considered for the 1906 Naval Programme, including the X4 design of  with  armour and  speed, but in the end this programme consisted only of three ships of the  type. A number of options were considered for the 1907–08 programme, ranging from  to , but in the end battleships were again favoured and no battlecruisers were ordered until the subsequent programme year.

At the time the final design of Indefatigable was approved, the Admiralty was already moving on, Fisher writing in September 1908 "I've got Sir Philip Watts into a new Indomitable that will make your mouth water when you see it", a design that was to eventually emerge as . In August 1909 the self-governing dominions met at the 1909 Imperial Conference, and in discussion of Imperial defence, the Admiralty proposed the creation of indigenous fleet units, each to consist of one Invincible-class battlecruiser, three light cruisers of the Bristol class, and six destroyers. These were to be based in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa in attempt to secure the naval defence of the Dominions while the Royal Navy concentrated in home waters to meet the German threat. While the scheme was rejected by Canada and South Africa, Australia and New Zealand subscribed, each ordering a modified version of the Indefatigable, rather than the originally proposed Invincible class. Australia became a ship of the newly formed Royal Australian Navy, while New Zealand was retained in European waters as a wholly RN unit. Eventually, only one fleet unit was formed, the Australian squadron in 1913.

Design

The  was ordered as the lone battlecruiser of the 1908–9 programme. Her outline design was prepared in March 1908, and the final design was approved in November 1908. This design was essentially an enlarged  with revised arrangements of protection and main armament.

General characteristics
The Indefatigables were slightly larger than their predecessors of the . They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of  at deep load. They displaced  at load and  at deep load, over  more than the earlier ships. They had a metacentric height of  at deep load.

Propulsion
Each paired set of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines was housed in a separate engine-room and drove two shafts. The wing shaft was coupled to the high-pressure ahead and astern turbines and the low-pressure turbines to the inner shafts. Each wing shaft drove a propeller  in diameter and the propellers on the inner shafts were  in diameter. The turbines were powered by thirty-one Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers in five boiler rooms. Indefatigables turbines were designed to produce a total of , but reached over  on forced draught during trials in 1911. The turbines of Australia and New Zealand were slightly more powerful at . They were designed for , but all three bettered  during trials.

The ships carried approximately  of coal, and an additional  of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, the ships could steam for  at a speed of .

Armament
Each ship carried eight BL  Mk X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. Two wing turrets were mounted amidships en echelon between the funnels, identified as 'P' and 'Q'. 'P' turret was mounted on the port side and normally faced forward, 'Q' turret was mounted on the starboard side and normally faced aft (rearwards). 'P' and 'Q' turrets were staggered—'P' was forward of 'Q', enabling 'P' to fire in a 70° arc to the starboard side and 'Q' to likewise fire towards the port side. These were the same guns as those mounted in , the  and .

The guns could initially be depressed to −3° and elevated to 13.5°, although the turrets were modified to allow 16° of elevation during World War I. They fired  projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 13.5°, this provided a maximum range of  with armour-piercing (AP) 2 crh shells. At 16° elevation, the range was extended to  using the more aerodynamic, but slightly heavier 4 crh AP shells. The rate of fire of these guns was 1–2 rounds per minute. The ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.

The secondary armament consisted of sixteen  BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure. All of the guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during refits in 1914 and 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two guns were removed at the same time. The guns on their PII* mounts had a maximum depression of 7° and a maximum elevation of 15°. They fired  projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this gave a maximum range of . Their rate of fire was 6–8 rounds per minute. They were provided with 100 rounds per gun.

An additional 4-inch gun was fitted in the surviving ships during 1917 as an anti-aircraft (AA) gun. It was mounted on a Mark II high-angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60°. It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only . Earlier anti-aircraft guns included a single QF  20 cwt AA gun on a high-angle Mark II mount that was added during refits in 1914–15. This had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. It fired a  shell at a muzzle velocity of  at a rate of fire of 12–14 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of . It was provided with 500 rounds. New Zealand carried a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss AA gun on a HA MkIc mounting from October 1914 to the end of 1915. This had a maximum depression of 8° and a maximum elevation of 60°. It fired a  shell at a muzzle velocity of  at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. It had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of only .

They mounted two 17.7-inch (450-mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each side aft of 'X' barbette, for which twelve torpedoes were carried.

Fire control

The spotting tops, a modern equivalent of the sailing ship's fighting top, at the head of the tripod fore and main masts controlled the fire of the Indefatigables main guns. Data from a  Barr and Stroud rangefinder was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station (TS) located beneath each spotting top where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. Each gun turret had its own transmission equipment and the turrets, Transmitting Stations, and spotting tops could be connected in almost any combination. Firing trials against  in 1907 revealed this system's vulnerability to gunfire as the spotting top was hit twice and a large splinter severed the voice pipe and all wiring running along the mast. To guard against this possibility 'A' turret of Indefatigable was fitted with a 9-foot rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof and it was equipped to control the entire main armament during a refit between 1911 and 1914.

Australia and New Zealand were built with a different arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and direct access to the primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.

Fire control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Indefatigables during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically transmitted training and elevation angles to the gun turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen had only to follow. The director layer's trigger fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. A gun within the 'Y' turret was also equipped with transmitters so that, as a backup, it could function as a "directing gun", but there was no provision for the gun battery to be split between the main director and this directing gun.  The Indefatigables received their director equipment between mid-1915 and May 1916.

Armour
In some ways the armour protection given to the Indefatigables was weaker than that of their predecessors as the armour was reduced in thickness in a number of places, but it was spread out to a greater extent. The main belt ran from stem to stern; it was  thick for the middle  of the ship, but was reduced to  abreast the end 12-inch gun barbettes and magazines and thinned still further to  at the ends of the ship. A  bulkhead met the barbette of X turret while the forward bulkhead was  in thickness. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by  of armour, except for the turret roofs which used  of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The supporting beams for the turret roofs were reinforced over those of the Invincibles based on lessons learned in firing trials conducted during 1907. The thickness of the main deck was generally  of nickel steel, but increased to  around the base of the barbettes. The lower deck armour of nickel steel was  on the flat and 2 inches thick on the slope, but increased to two inches at the ship's ends. The sides of the forward conning tower were  thick while the spotting tower had four inches. The roof and floor of both towers were KNC armour 3 inches thick while the conning tower's communication tube was four inches of KNC. The torpedo director tower is 1 inch of nickel steel all around. Nickel steel torpedo bulkheads of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. The funnel uptakes were protected with 1.5 inches of nickel steel on the sides and 1 inch on the ends. Krupp cemented armour was used throughout, unless otherwise mentioned.

Australia and New Zealand were built with a different arrangement. The waterline belt did not extend to the ends, but terminated  short of the bow and  short of the stern. The sections abreast the barbettes were thickened to  and the sections at each end were increased to four inches. The main deck armour was increased to 2.5 inches around the barbettes and was extended 55 feet past the rear barbette. The lower deck armour was decreased from 1.5–2 inches to one inch, both on the flat and slope, except at the ends where it was thickened to 2.5 inches. After Jutland one inch of armour was added to the magazine crowns and the turret roofs with a total weight of .

Construction
The following table gives the build details and purchase cost of the members of the Indefatigable class. Whilst standard British practice at that time was for these costs to exclude armament and stores, for some reason the cost quoted in The Naval Annual for Indefatigable includes the armament.

* = estimated cost, including guns

Service history
Indefatigable was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet upon her commissioning in 1911. She was transferred to the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet in December 1913. New Zealand was only briefly assigned to the Home Fleet before she sailed for New Zealand in February 1912. She returned to Portsmouth the following December and was assigned again to the Home Fleet. She made a number of port visits to France and Russia before the war began. Australia set sail for Australia almost immediately after she was commissioned in June 1913 to assume her duties as the first flagship of the Royal Australian Navy.

Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau

Indefatigable, accompanied by , under the command of Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne, encountered the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville, but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to recoal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but Goeben and Breslau were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time war had been declared, after the German invasion of Belgium, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six-mile (10 km) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the Strait of Messina where they could observe the port directly. Milne therefore stationed  and Indefatigable at the northern exit of the Straits of Messina, still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports; he stationed the light cruiser  at the southern exit and sent Indomitable to recoal at Bizerte, where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean.

The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards Constantinople, trailed by Gloucester. Milne, still expecting Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August, when he set sail for Cape Matapan, where Goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier, at a leisurely . At 14:30 he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria — war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian breakout attempt, rather than seek Goeben. Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to "chase Goeben which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east." Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean, unaware that the Goeben did not intend to come out.

On 3 November Churchill ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia. The attack was carried out by Indomitable and Indefatigable, as well as the French pre-dreadnought battleships  and . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which did not happen until 6 November. Indefatigable remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by Inflexible on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta to refit. Having completed her refit she sailed to England on 14 February where she joined the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) upon her arrival.

Australia in the Pacific

Following the declaration of war, Australia was assigned to find the German East Asia Squadron, the only Central Powers naval force of note in the Pacific. During this hunt, she was attached to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and provided support during the Force's invasion of Rabaul, in case the German squadron was present. The squadron's commander, Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, was wary of Australia, which he described as being superior to his squadron.

Following von Spee's withdrawal from the Pacific, Australia was belatedly ordered on 8 November 1914 to join with several Japanese cruisers off Mexico to resume the hunt for the German cruisers. By this time, the German squadron had made its way to the South Atlantic, and in early December was destroyed by a British squadron in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Australia was sent to join the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron at Rosyth, Scotland, and was made flagship of the squadron after a short refit.

Battle of Heligoland Bight

New Zealands first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight operation on 28 August 1914. Beatty's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 AM when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade estuary. The brand-new light cruiser  had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the light cruisers  and  when Beatty's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. Strassburg was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but Cöln remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. But Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser  directly to his front. He turned in pursuit, but reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at a range under . At 13:10 Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Shortly after turning north, Beatty's main body encountered the crippled Cöln and she was sunk by two salvos from .

Raid on Scarborough

The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would actually conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, now reduced to four ships, including New Zealand, as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.

Admiral Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5:15 and fought an inconclusive action with them. Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender, commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron, had received a signal at 05:40 that  was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not. The destroyer  spotted the German armoured cruiser  and her escorts at about 07:00, but could not transmit the message until 7:25. Admiral Warrender received the signal, as did New Zealand, but Beatty did not, despite the fact that New Zealand had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty. Warrender attempted to pass on Shark's message to Beatty at 07:36, but did not manage to make contact until 07:55. Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched New Zealand to search for Roon. She was being overhauled by New Zealand when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty ordered New Zealand to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.

The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty's ships passed to the north while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a  gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper.  spotted the light cruiser  and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however, those were some 50 km (31 mi) behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.

Battle of Dogger Bank

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. But the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty, which included New Zealand. Contact was initiated at 07:20 on the 24th when the British light cruiser Arethusa spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35 the Germans had spotted Beatty's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increased speed to 's maximum speed of  if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. New Zealand and Indomitable were the slowest of Beatty's ships and gradually fell behind the newer and faster battlecruisers, but New Zealand was able to open fire on Blücher by 09:35. She continued to engage Blücher after the other, faster, battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers. After about an hour New Zealand had knocked out Blüchers forward turret and Indomitable began to fire on her as well at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells pierced her armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room at 10:35. This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port  turrets and the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed had dropped to  and her steering gear jammed. At 10:48 Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her. But due to a combination of a mistake by Beatty's flag lieutenant in signalling and heavy damage to Beatty's flagship , which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards so that Beatty could not communicate with his ships that caused the rest of the battlecruisers, temporarily under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in New Zealand, to believe that that signal applied to them. So they turned away from Hipper's main body and engaged Blücher. New Zealand fired 147 shells at Blücher before she capsized and sank at 12:07 after being torpedoed.

Battle of Jutland

On 31 May 1916 the 2nd BCS consisted of New Zealand (Flagship of Rear Admiral William Christopher Pakenham) and Indefatigable as Australia was still under repair following her collision with New Zealand on 22 April. It was assigned to Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 14:30. Almost immediately afterwards, at 15:32, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to  to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about  behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still far too north to cut off Hipper.

This began what was to be called the 'Run to the South' as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed almost immediately afterwards by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships,  and  had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with Indefatigable in the rear and the furthest to the west, and New Zealand ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. Indefatigable aimed at  while New Zealand aimed at  while remaining unengaged herself. By 15:54 the range was down to  and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57. Around 16:00 Indefatigable was hit by two or three shells from Von der Tann around the rear turret and almost immediately fell off to starboard and was down by the stern and listing to port. She was hit twice more on the next volley, once on forecastle and on the forward turret, and blew up at about 16:03 when her magazines exploded. The most likely cause of her loss was a low-order explosion in 'X' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the control shafts between the steering engines and the steering gear, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. Von der Tann fired only 52  shells at Indefatigable before she exploded, taking 1017 men with her. The only two survivors were rescued by the German torpedo boat .

After Indefatigables loss New Zealand shifted her fire to Von der Tann in accordance with Beatty's standing instructions. The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 16:12 and 16:15. By this time the 5th Battle Squadron of four s had close up and was engaging Von der Tann and Moltke. At 16:23 a  shell from  hit near Von der Tanns rear turret and started a fire among the practice targets stowed there that completely enveloped the ship and caused New Zealand to shift fire to Moltke. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer's battleships, but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen-point turn to starboard in succession. New Zealand, last ship in the fleet, turned prematurely to stay outside the range of the oncoming battleships. During the entire 'Run to the South' she was hit only once, in 'Y' turret by a 28 cm shell with little effect.

New Zealand was engaged by the battleship  beginning at 17:08 during what came to be called the 'Run to the North', but she was not hit, although she was straddled several times. Beatty's ships maintained full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet. At 17:40 they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 17:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 18:35 Beatty was following Indomitable and  of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Twenty minutes later Scheer ordered another 180° turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 19:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap in which he had sent them.

This was successful and the British lost sight of the Germans until 20:05 when  spotted smoke bearing west-northwest. Ten minutes later she had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only  away. Inflexible opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty's battlecruisers. New Zealand and Indomitable concentrated their fire on  and hit her five times before she turned west to disengage. Shortly after 20:30 the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans only were able to fire a few rounds at them due to the poor visibility and turned away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 20:40. After this Beatty changed course to south-southeast and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 02:55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course.

Post-Jutland careers

Australia rejoined the 2nd BCS on 9 June 1916 as the squadron flagship, but there was little significant naval activity for the Indefatigables, other than routine patrolling, thanks to the Kaiser's order that his ships should not be allowed to go to sea unless assured of victory. Australia collided with  on 12 December 1917 and was under repair through the following month. She was present at the internment of the High Seas fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918. New Zealand was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for Admiral Jellicoe's year-long tour of India and the Dominions and she was paid off upon her return on 15 March 1920 into reserve. She was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922. Australia sailed for Australia on 23 April 1921 and became flagship of the Royal Australian Navy upon her arrival. Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty she was scuttled east of Sydney on 12 April 1924.
Roman Urdu is the name used for the Urdu language written with the Latin script, also known as the Roman script.

According to the Urdu scholar Habib R. Sulemani: "Roman Urdu is strongly opposed by the traditional Arabic script lovers. Despite this opposition it is still used by most on the internet and computers due to limitations of most technologies as they do not have the Urdu script. Although, this script is under development and thus the net users are using the Roman script in their own ways. Popular websites like Jang Group have devised their own schemes for Roman Urdu. This is of great advantage for those who are not able to read the Arabic script. MSN, Yahoo and some desi-chat-rooms are working as laboratories for the evolving new script and language (Roman Urdu)."

Romanized Urdu is mutually intelligible with Romanized Hindi in informal contexts, unlike Urdu written in the Urdu alphabet and Hindi in Devanagari. Multinational corporations often use it as a cost effective method for printing and advertising in order to market their products in both Pakistan and India.

Although the idea of romanising Urdu had been suggested several times, it was General Ayub Khan who most seriously suggested adopting the Latin alphabet for Urdu and all Pakistani languages during his rule of the country. The suggestion was inspired to an extent by Atatürk's adoption of the Latin alphabet for Turkish in Turkey.

In India, where the Devanagari script is used, Roman Urdu was widely used in the Indian Army, as well as in Christian mission schools, especially for translations of the Bible.

The Hunterian transliteration system mostly avoids diacritics and non-standard characters.

Usage

Christian community in the Indian subcontinent 

Urdu was the dominant native language among Christians of Karachi, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan in the 20th century and is still used today by some people in these states. Pakistani and Indian Christians often used the Roman script for writing Urdu. The Bible Society of India publishes Roman Urdu Bibles, which enjoyed sale late into the 1960s (though they are still published today). Church songbooks are also common in Roman Urdu. However, its usage in Christian contexts is declining in India with the wider use of Hindi and English in the states.

Film industry 
Bollywood, India's major film industry, uses a version of Roman script as the main script for its film titles. This is because Bollywood films have an appeal for viewers across South Asia and even in the Middle East. The Devanāgarī script is used mostly by Hindi speakers while the Perso-Arabic script is used primarily by Urdu speakers. The language used in Bollywood films is often called Hindi, but most dialogues are actually written in Hindustani—they can be understood by Urdu and Hindi speakers alike. Because the film industry wants to reach the largest possible audience, just using the Devanāgarī or Perso-Arabic script would be unfavorable for the Bollywood industry as few individuals are literate in both scripts. For this reason, the neutral Roman script is used for Bollywood film titles, though some films include the Hindi and Urdu scripts as well.

The similar circumstances are also applied with Pakistan's Lollywood filming industry, where, along with the Urdu name or title of the movie, a Roman Urdu title is always provided for viewers.

Internet 
Roman Urdu used on the Internet is non standard and has irregular spelling. Users who use Roman Urdu on the Internet try to imitate English orthography. In most cases they are unaware of the fact that English spelling is not always phonetic.

Romanization schemes 
There are several Romanization standards for writing Urdu among them the most prominent are Uddin and Begum Urdu-Hindustani Romanization, ALA-LC romanization and ArabTeX.

There are two main problems with existing Roman Urdu schemes. Either they are not reversible to Urdu script or they do not allow pronouncing the Urdu words properly. Another shortcoming is that a lot of Roman Urdu schemes confuse the Urdu letter 'Choti He' which has the sound of voiceless glottal fricative with 'Do Chasham He' which is used as a digraph for aspirated consonants in Urdu script. The digraphs "Sh" for letter Shin and "Zh" for letter Zhe also cause problems as they could be interpreted as the letter Sin and 'Choti He' or letter Ze and 'Choti He' respectively. Most Roman Urdu schemes also do not take much consideration of Urdu orthography and the spelling system.

Informal Roman Urdu 

The system of Romanisation used most often by native speakers differs from the formal systems presented in most English language sources. It contains no diacritics or special characters, usually just the 26 letters of the core English alphabet. Informal Romanised Urdu is mutually intelligible with Romanised Hindi and the distinction between the languages can be controversial.

While the Urdu alphabet is derived from the Arabic alphabet informal Romanised Urdu is less eccentric than informal Romanised Arabic. Informal Romanised Urdu does not use numerals, and rarely uses mixed case, because the Arabic letters that lack a clear equivalent in the English Latin alphabet (e.g.) are often silent in Urdu or pronounced identically to other letters (e.g.). So, this system of Urdu Romanisation is used in some slightly more formal contexts than informal Romanised Arabic.

One example is the word  "aurat". Formal transliterations often include a punctuation mark (') or special character for the ayn  but this is omitted by Urdu speakers such as in the context of the Aurat March  on International Women's Day. Adding the special characters makes it harder to type and would cause things such as twitter hashtags to break. The discussion on social media about these events is often in informal Romanised Urdu, with frequent code-switching between Urdu and English, but the handwritten or expertly typeset signs at the events are mostly in either English, Urdu in the traditional script, or local languages.

Radical Routes is a UK-based network of housing co-ops. The organisation supports new and established co-ops through loan finance, training workshops, practical support, and national gatherings.

History
Radical Routes emerged in 1986 from a network of people in London and Hull who wanted to develop workers' co-operatives. The network agreed its common aims and adopted the name Radical Routes in 1988, and became incorporated as Radical Routes Limited in 1992. In 1998 Rootstock Limited was incorporated as an investment scheme supporting Radical Routes co-operatives. The original house in Hockley was set up as the 'New Education Housing Co-op'.

According to Rootstock, between 1991 and 2012 Radical Routes made over sixty loans to member co-ops – totaling over £1m – with no co-operatives defaulting on loan payments. These loans have typically been used by member housing co-ops, in addition to finance from traditional lenders, to buy property.

Work
Radical Routes provides small loans (up to about £50,000) to member co-operatives. Decisions on making loans are made collectively by other member co-operatives, this has been described as "peer-group loan appraisal".

Radical Routes publishes booklets on subjects such as How to set up a Housing Co-operative and How to set up a Worker Co-operative.

With Cooperatives UK they launched proposals for an independent co-operative regulator after the government announced that it would be abolishing the FSA. Previously the FSA had regulated co-operatives, which were registered as industrial and provident societies.

Radical Routes is developing a ‘co-op cluster’ model for co-op housing with groups of housing co-ops combining their assets to buy new properties outright, eliminating mortgage interest.

Membership
Member co-operatives are expected to commit to a share of Radical Routes' workload as volunteers, and work toward radical social change.

The organisation has 36 members: 32 housing co-ops and 4 worker co-ops.

Limitations 
A 2014 round table report by Radical Routes and Friends Provident Foundation identified carpet bagging, among other things, as a systemic weakness within the existing housing co-op framework. 'Carpet bagging' refers to established co-ops significantly reducing their rents or, rarely, selling their property for private gain. The report explores ways in which the systematic weaknesses might be addressed, mentioning the Mietshäuser Syndikat model as having provably solved the carpet bagging issue.
Hugh Kingsmill Lunn (21 November 1889 – 15 May 1949), who dropped his surname for professional purposes, was a versatile British writer and journalist. The writers Arnold Lunn and Brian Lunn were his brothers.

Life
Hugh Kingsmill Lunn was born at Torrington Square, Bloomsbury, London, second son and second child of the three sons and one daughter of Sir Henry Simpson Lunn, founder of the travel agency Lunn Poly, and Mary Ethel, née Moore, daughter of a canon. He was educated at Harrow School and the University of Oxford. After graduating he worked for a brief period for Frank Harris, who edited the publication Hearth and Home in 1911/2, alongside Enid Bagnold; Kingsmill later wrote a debunking biography of Harris. He began fighting in the British Army in World War I in 1916, and was captured in France the next year. He was held as a prisoner of war at Mainz Citadel with, among others, J. Milton Hayes and Alec Waugh.

After the war he began to write, initially both science fiction and crime fiction. In the 1930s he was a contributor to the English Review; later he wrote a good deal of non-fiction for that periodical's successor, the English Review Magazine. His large output includes criticism, essays and biographies, parodies and humour, as well as novels, and he edited a number of anthologies. He is remembered for saying 'friends are God's apology for relations', with a notable flavour of Ambrose Bierce. The dictum was subsequently used by Richard Ingrams for the title of his memoir of Kingsmill's friendships with Hesketh Pearson and Malcolm Muggeridge, two intimate friends whom he influenced greatly.

Kingmill was literary editor of Punch from 1942 to 1944 and of the New English Review from 1945 to 1949. He married Eileen FitzGerald in 1915 and there was one daughter. The marriage broke up in 1927. Kingsmill married a second time in 1934 to Dorothy Vernon, and there were two daughters and a son. (She also had one son of her own). He died of cancer in Brighton in 1949.

Satire
Muggeridge drew a darker attitude from Kingsmill's sardonic wit. Dawnist was Kingsmill's word for those infected with unrealistic or utopian idealism – the enemy as far as he was concerned.

Kingsmill's parody of A. E. Housman's poetry has been recognised as definitive:
What still alive at twenty-two,
A clean, upstanding chap like you?
Sure, if your throat 'tis hard to slit,
Slit your girl's, and swing for it.

Like enough, you won't be glad,
When they come to hang you, lad:
But bacon's not the only thing
That's cured by hanging from a string.

So, when the spilt ink of the night
Spreads o'er the blotting-pad of light,
Lads whose job is still to do
Shall whet their knives, and think of you. 

Housman himself said of this parody: "It's the best I have seen, and indeed, the only good one."

Anthologist
Despite his wide range as a novelist, biographer, essayist, and literary critic, Kingsmill is best known today as an anthologist. He compiled at least eight of his humorous and original anthologies (depending on how they are classified) between 1929 and 1955. The first, An Anthology of Invective and Abuse, was by far the most successful and remains the best known. Oswald Mosley was so enthusiastic about it that he forwarded a copy to Adolf Hitler. According to Hesketh Pearson in his preface to High Hill of the Muses (the last of the anthologies) "Kingsmill himself became a little restless when people praised his volume of vituperation." 

Michael Holroyd judges The Worst of Love (1931), a collection of insincere writing, to be the funniest. It resembles the better known anthology The Stuffed Owl, compiled by D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles Lee, which was published the year before. Owing to his wide reading and good memory, Kingsmill could put together an anthology inside a month, which helped him meet pressing financial commitments. Two other works, The English Genius (1938) and Johnson Without Boswell (1940), take on aspects of the anthology form but include more original content.

Annotated list of works
The Will To Love (1919). Novel written under the name "Hugh Lunn". The character Ralph Parker is based on Frank Harris and Barbara on Enid Bagnold.
The Dawn's Delay (1924). Includes three short novels: 'W.J', 'The End of the World' and 'The Disintegration of a Politician'. Published at his own expense.
Blondel (1927). Novel, begun in 1925. Set in the period of Richard Coeur de Lion but not a historical novel: it's based on a love affair Kingsmill had with an Irish cousin in his teens.

William Collins (12 October 1789 – 2 January 1853) was a Scottish schoolmaster, editor and publisher who founded William Collins, Sons, now part of HarperCollins. William Collins was born at Eastwood, Renfrewshire,  on 12 October 1789.  He was a millworker who established a company in 1819 for printing and publishing. The business eventually published pamphlets, sermons, hymn books and prayer books as well as a wide range of office products. By 1824 he had produced the company's first dictionary, the Greek and English Lexicon. He was instrumental in bringing Thomas Chalmers from Kilmany to Glasgow. He also obtained a licence to publish the Bible in the 1840s. He was promoter of Scotland's first temperance movement. He founded the Glasgow Church Building Society which created 20 new churches. He died on 2 January 1853 at Rothesay, Buteshire.

Church elder
At the age of twenty-five Mr Collins was ordained an elder in the congregation of the Tron Church,  Glasgow,  then under the pastoral care of Dr M'Gill.  In the course of his reading he happened to peruse the article on the Evidences of Christianity in the Encydopcedia Britannica. The freshness of its intellectual power,  and the glow of its moral and evangelical enthusiasm,  impressed and delighted him.  Accordingly,  when Dr M'Gill died,  Mr Collins turned his eyes to the author of the article which had so fascinated him,  the Rev. Thomas Chalmers,  as a  suitable successor to Dr M'Gill,  and greatly aided in the movement which resulted in the appointment by the Town Council of the young minister of Kilmany  to the church and parish of the Tron.  From no one did Dr Chalmers receive a  heartier welcome on his induction in 1815 than from the youngest member of his session,  Mr Collins.

Work with Thomas Chalmers
When Dr Chalmers originated the idea of local Sabbath Schools,  Mr Collins opened the first school.  Chalmers was next transferred to the new parish of St John's.  Mr Collins accompanied his minister to his new charge,  and still kept his place by his side. To Dr Chalmers,  with his keen political and social insight,  it belonged to originate methods of civic and Christian economy,  and to expound and recommend them.  But his elder,  quiet and unobtrusive,  came after him,  testing the ideas of his chief,  and giving them practical realization in the hovels of the poor.

Collins and the slave trade
Collins advocated for the abolition of African slavery,  at a  time when that cause was not so popular as it came to be at a  later date.  This brought him into contact and co-operation with William Wilberforce, Zachary Macaulay,  and other champions of the emancipation of the slave.  The fact that he took openly the side of the slaves,  and that petitions for emancipation lay in his book shop,  alienated some of his business customers,  many of whom were largely interested in the West India trade.

Publishing of religious works
Mr Collins,  published religious literature by reprinting,  in a  more accessible form many of the writings of the divines of the sixteenth and seventeenth century.  To these volumes suitable introductions were prefixed,  written by the more eminent clergymen and laymen of the day,  of all denominations.

Involvement in the temperance movement
When the temperance cause found its way to Scotland from the United States in 1829,  Mr Collins hailed it,  as  "throwing a  ray of light," to use his own words,  upon a  dark problem.  He was the earliest member of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Temperance Society,  and he laboured to promote its object.  He visited,  on this errand,  many of the towns of Scotland,  and even extended his tours to Manchester,  Liverpool,  and London,  in all which places he delivered addresses to large audiences.  He visited the metropolis three times,  and succeeded,  on his third visit,  in forming the British and Foreign Temperance Society.  At one of its early meetings in Exeter Hall he delivered his famous lecture on the  "Harmony of the Gospel and Temperance Societies".  From 1829 to 1834 a  large portion of his time and means were devoted to the maintenance of a  cause which he regarded as very important.

Glaswegian church building scheme

After talking with his daughter Collins conceived of his grand enterprise of aiming to provide twenty additional parish churches for Glasgow.  Many pronounced his scheme a  "devout imagination;"  but the very greatness of the enterprise contributed largely to its 
success.  Christian philanthropy in those days found vent in contributions of one guinea,  five guineas,  and,  on very extraordinary occasions,  ten guineas.  Here was an appeal to Christian men to unite in achieving a  great object of an evangelical kind by contributions of  ;£200 each,  payable in five instalments.  This was a  novelty ;  but a  novelty that first 
astounded and next attracted men.  The originator,  they saw,  was in earnest.  He had given proof of this by subscribing at once his own quota,  from,  as was known,  very slender means.  His example stimulated the liberality of those whose incomes were five,  ten,  twenty fold that of the propounder of the scheme,  and the result was that in a  few months Mr Collins had obtained,  mainly by his own exertions,  the sum of; £22,000; and only eight years after he had first mooted his proposal before an incredulous public,  he had the happiness of consummating his enterprise by laying the foundation stone of the twentieth church erected under the auspices of the Glasgow Church Building Society.  Of these churches,  not fewer than thirteen or fourteen had the name of William Collins graven on their foundation stone.

National church building scheme
The work was taken up by Dr Chalmers,  who resolved on doing for Scotland what Collins had done for Glasgow.  A Government Commission was appointed to inquire into the matter.  Elaborate statistics of the spiritual destitution of Glasgow were given in 
by Mr Collins to that Commission.  These were not without important results.  Copies were sent to all the dignitaries of the Church of England,  and the result of their circulation among the English bishops and clergy,  was the formation of church building societies in at least two of the dioceses of the sister kingdom.  The metropolis of England did not deem it beneath it to follow in the wake of Presbyterian Glasgow,  nor its metropolitan pastor to copy the example of the elder of the Tron.

Post Disruption church building
In the labours of the busy years following the Disruption  to provide churches,  manses,  and schools for the 
congregations of the Free Church,  he took part,  according to the measure of his strength.  He laid the foundation stone of the new Church erected for the congregation of Free St John's,  then under the pastoral care of Dr Thomas Brown.  He also laid the foundation stone of the Free Tron,  of which Dr Robert Buchanan  was minister ;  and now he connected himself once more with the session of that congregation.  He had left it twenty-one years before;  he now returned and acted as an elder in it till he died.

Last days
In 1848,  with failing health he relocated to Rothesay.  There he took an active part in the establishing of a  missionary station in the most destitute part of that town.  On Sabbath,  2 January 1853,   Mr Collins died.

Family

His son Sir William Collins served as Lord Provost of Glasgow.

The Pragati Legislature Party(Also called Pragati Dal) was a political grouping in the Legislative Assembly of the Indian state Orissa. PLP was formed in 1973 by the Utkal Congress, Swatantra Party and others. The PLP leader Biju Patnaik, was elected as the Leader of the Opposition of the Assembly on February 9, 1973. His tenure as Leader of Opposition lasted until March 3 the same year. On that date President's Rule was introduced in the state.

PLP and its member organizations later merged into Bharatiya Lok Dal in the end of 1974.

Background

Politics in early 70's Orissa was very fluid. The election of 1971 threw a hung assembly. A coalition government was formed by Utkala Congress, Swatantra Party, Jharkhand Party and others. This government under leadership of Bishwanath Das lasted about a year. There were defections and it lost majority. A Congress government headed by Nandini Satpathy came into power by inducting the defectors from Utkal Congress. However the Satpathy government lost majority in six months when the ex-Utkal Congress Members decided to revive Utkal Congress. Satpathy Decided to call an election. On the eve of election  Swatantra Party, Utkal Congress and Swadhin Congress decided to form Pragati Legislature Party. PLP staked claim to form government, but the Governor B.D Jatti dissolved the assembly and called for election.

Organisation
PLP was not a political party in a conventional sense. Its different constituents fought elections under different symbols and campaigned under different flags. It was led by 3 stalwarts of Orissa politics, Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo , Biju Patnaik, and Harekrushna Mahatab.

Electoral Performance 
PLP won 56 seats in the 1974 mid-term elections. Biju Patnaik was elected as leader of opposition.

Sfântu Gheorghe (or Szentgyörgy ; ; English lit.: Saint George) is the capital city of Covasna County, Romania. Located in the central part of the country and in the historical region of Transylvania, it lies on the Olt River in a valley between the Baraolt Mountains and the . The city administers two villages, Chilieni (Kilyén) and Coșeni (Szotyor).

History
Sfântu Gheorghe is one of the oldest cities in Transylvania, the settlement first having been documented in 1332. The city takes its name from Saint George, the patron of the local church. Historically it was also known in German as Sankt Georgen. The "sepsi" prefix (sebesi → sepsi, meaning "of Sebes") refers to the area which the ancestors of the local Székely population had inhabited before settling to the area of the town. The previous area of their settlement was around the town of "Sebes" (now: Sebeș) which later became populated mainly by Transylvanian Saxons.

While part of the Kingdom of Hungary, the city was the economic and administrative center of the Hungarian county of Háromszék, which spanned the present-day Covasna County and parts of Brașov County. In the second half of the 19th century, Sepsiszentgyörgy witnessed the development of light industry, namely a textile and a cigarette factory was built. It became part of the Kingdom of Romania following the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, after the end of World War I. After the Second Vienna Award in 1940 the city returned to Hungary. Near the end of that period, the Sfântu Gheorghe ghetto briefly existed in the city. At the end of the Second World War the Paris Peace Treaties reaffirmed the city and the entirety of Transylvania as a Romanian occupied territory. Between 1952 and 1960 it was the southernmost town of the Magyar Autonomous Region, and between 1960 and 1968 was part of the Brașov Region, abolished in 1968 when Romania was reorganised based on counties rather than regions.

Sfântu Gheorghe is one of the centres for the Székely people in the region known to them as Székelyföld in Hungarian – which means "Székely Land", and is home to the Székely National Museum. The city hosts two market fairs each year.

Demographics

The majority of the city's inhabitants are Hungarians. In the census of 2011, 41,233 (74%) of the city's 56,006 inhabitants classed themselves as ethnic Hungarians, 11,807 (21%) as Romanians, 398 (0.7%) as Roma, and 2,562 as other ethnicities or no information. 74% had Hungarian as first language, and 21% Romanian.

The priestly breastplate or breastpiece of judgment (ḥōšen) was a sacred breastplate worn by the High Priest of the Israelites, according to the Book of Exodus. In the biblical account, the breastplate is termed the breastplate of judgment (ḥōšen mišpāṭ -), because the Urim and Thummim (hāʾūrīm wəhattummīm) were placed upon it.. These elements of the breastplate are said in the Exodus verse to carry the judgement (mišpāṭ) of God concerning the Israelites at all times.

Hebrew Bible 

According to the description in Exodus, this breastplate was attached to the tunic-like garment known as an ephod by gold chains/cords tied to the gold rings on the ephod's shoulder straps, and by blue ribbon tied to the gold rings at the belt of the ephod. The biblical description states that the breastplate was also to be made from the same material as the Ephod—embroidery of 3 colors of dyed wool and linen—and was to be  of a cubit squared, two layers thick, and with four rows of three engraved gems embedded in gold settings upon it, one setting for each stone. The description states that the square breastplate was to be formed from one rectangular piece of cloth— of a cubit by  of a cubit, folded so that it formed a pouch to contain the Urim and Thummim.

The Hebrew term for the breastplate,  (ḥōšen), appears to be named from its appearance, The 19th-century German biblical scholar August Dillmann thought that it was likely to be derived from the Hebrew word  (ḥōṣen), meaning "fold", relating to its function.

According to the Talmud, the wearing of the Hoshen atoned for the sin of errors in judgment on the part of the Children of Israel.

The jewels 

The twelve jewels in the breastplate were each, according to the Biblical description, to be made from specific minerals, none of them the same as another, and each of them representative of a specific tribe, whose name was to be inscribed on the stone. According to a rabbinic tradition, the names of the twelve tribes were engraved upon the stones with what is called in Hebrew: שמיר = shamir, which, according to Rashi, was a small, rare creature which could cut through the toughest surfaces, but according to Rabbi David Kimhi and Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah, was a stone stronger than iron (possibly Naxian stone). The word has its equivalent in the Greek, σμήρις (smeris).

There are different views in classical rabbinical literature as to the order of the names; the Jerusalem Targum, for example, argued that the names appeared in the order according to which they were born. Maimonides describes the jewel stones arranged in four rows, saying that on the first stone belonging to Reuben were also engraved the names of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, while on the last stone belonging to Benjamin were also engraved the words "the tribes of God"; kabbalistic writers such as Hezekiah ben Manoah and Bahya ben Asher argued that only six letters from each name were present on each stone, together with a few letters from the names of Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, or from the phrase "[these are] the tribes of Jeshurun", so that there were 72 letters in total (72 being a very significant number in Kabbalistic thought). Other researchers, such as Paul Phelps, believe that the order of gemstones that are displayed on the chestpiece correlates to the order that Ezekiel viewed the gates of Zion, as each gate represents one of the twelve tribes, with the gates themselves being studded with gemstones.

There was also a different order for the names inscribed on the two "onyx"  stones, carried on the High Priest's shoulders. One opinion suggests that the names of the twelve tribes were arranged in groups after their mothers: Leah's six sons aligned one after the other on one stone, with Judah heading this list, followed by Rachel's sons with the names of the concubines' sons interposed between the two sons of Rachel. 

Unfortunately, the meanings of the Hebrew names for the minerals, given by the masoretic text, are not clear, and though the Greek names for them in the Septuagint are more clear, some scholars believe that they cannot be completely relied on for this matter because the breastplate had gone out of use by the time the Septuagint was created, and several Greek names for various gems have changed meaning between the classical era and modern times. However, although classical rabbinical literature argues that the names were inscribed using a Shamir worm because neither chisels nor paint nor ink were allowed to mark them out, a more naturalistic approach suggests that the jewels must have had comparatively low hardness in order to be engraved upon, and therefore this gives an additional clue to the identity of the minerals. Others suggest that they were engraved with emery, having the similar property of a diamond used in cutting other stones and which was called in Greek σμήρις (smeris).

Explanation of the symbolic meaning of the jewels generated a great deal of both Jewish and Christian writing, and was a staple component of the tradition of lapidaries or books on gemology.

The jewel stones are as follows (the first item in each row is probably the right hand side, as Hebrew is a right to left script):

First row 

Odem (in the masoretic text) / Sardios (in the Septuagint) – both names mean red (Odem is cognate with Adam), and probably refers to sard, a very common stone in classical cultures. All authors agree that this stone was of a red colour. With due respect to the Septuagint, Odem might also refer to carnelian, which was flesh-coloured, or to jasper, which was usually a deep blood-red, was valued as a charm against bleeding, and was common in the surrounding nations of Egypt, Babylonia, and Assyria. The Chinese Union Version refers to this stone as being a ruby.
Pit'dah (פִּטְדָה in the masoretic text) / Topazios (in the Septuagint) – despite the suggestion of the Septuagint that it was topaz, topaz was scarcely known at the time the Book of Exodus was written (according to both the traditional dating of the book and that by critical scholars); in the classical era, topazios referred to Topazos Island, on which a particular yellow mineral was mined (topazios means to seek, in reference to the difficulty in finding the island). Others suggest that topaz was merely peridot, a light green semi-precious stone, and which stone in the ancient world was found primarily on Topazos Island as well as on St. John's Island (Zabargad) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The word pit'dah is thought by scholars to be connected with the Assyrian word hipindu, which refers to something that flashed (presumably meaning shimmered), and thus the jewel in question would fit the description of chrysolite, a translucent greenish yellow mineral, common throughout the Levant, and particularly found on Zabargad in the Red Sea, under the control of the Egyptian Pharaoh.
Bareḳet (בָּרֶקֶת in the masoretic text, cf. בָּרְקַת) / Smaragdos (in the Septuagint) – Bareketh etymologically means 'lightning flash', whence shimmering or shiny. Smaragdos is cognate with emerald, but is somewhat of a false friend as the Greek term could apply to a number of different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. Smaragdos was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the stricter modern sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty, 1900s BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are heliodor (taking into account the implication of Smaragdos that it was green) and rock crystal (ignoring the literal meaning of Smaragdos, since the masoretic text does not appear to specify colour); there is much to be said for Smaragdos being either of those. Although "emerald" is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, bareḳet, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezekiel 28:13), the word bareḳet is rendered as "onyx". Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes בָרקָן = barḳan, for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), the stone called bareḳet had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as "agate". In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, baḳarani (believed to be a corruption of barḳan) was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen's Hexapla, has also written κεραύνιος, literally meaning ‘of a thunderbolt’, and a more direct translation of the stone known in Hebrew as bareḳet relating to baraḳ ‘lightning’ in Exodus 28:17. Jerome, however, understood the Greek word to mean "onyx".

Second row 

Nofekh (נֹפֶךְ = in the masoretic text) / Anthrax (in the Septuagint) – while Anthrax simply means coal (presumably here referring to the colour of burning coal), the Vulgate here has Carbunculus, referring to the carbuncle, which was red. Philo of Alexandria, when writing about this stone, says that it was red. He seems to be in agreement with Josephus, the LXX, and the Jerusalem Targum, the latter saying that it is כדכדנא, explained by Saadia Gaon as meaning karkand, a red variety of precious stone. Nofekh appears to be a loan word; it may derive from the Egyptian term mfkꜣt, referring to malachite or turquoise, both of which are a greenish blue; it may instead derive from lupakku, a term appearing in the Amarna letters, referring to a mineral of unknown colour which was sent in tribute to Akhnaten from Ashkalon. In classical rabbinical literature there is some debate between whether Nofekh was red or greenish blue; Exodus Rabbah and the second Jerusalem Targum favour it being red, while the Babylonian Targum and first Jerusalem Targum favour it being green.
Sapir (סַפִּיר = in the masoretic text) / Sapphiros (in the Septuagint) – despite appearing to refer to sapphire, sapphire was essentially unknown before the era of the Roman Empire and its use in Greek texts is believed to be a mere transliteration of the Hebrew. Once it became more known, it was treated as merely being a form of hyacinth or of jacinth. It is more likely that the term Sapir referred to a mineral of similar colour to sapphires, and that the name gradually came to refer to the latter mineral, on account of its colour; scholars think the most likely candidate is lapis lazuli, a stone with a deep, ocean-blue colour which was frequently sent as a gift to Akhenaten from Babylon. Theophrastus mentions the stone sapphirus as being "dark" and having the "colour of verdigris", as well as being "speckled as of with gold". By all accounts, his description fits the lapis-lazuli.
Yahalom (יָהֲלֹם = in the masoretic text) / Iaspis ἴασπις (in the Septuagint) – in some other places the Septuagint instead has Beryllios where the masoretic reads Yahalom. The word Yahalom appears to be connected with the Hebrew meaning strike hard, and possibly with the word hallamish meaning flint; hallamish is connected to the Assyrian word elmeshu, referring to a precious stone which was hard, and possibly white, or at least with an insignificant colour, and from which whole rings were sometimes made. A few scholars have suggested that Yahalom may refer to diamonds, owing to their hardness, though the skill of cutting diamonds had not been discovered before the classical era. Although the Septuagint's Onychion is the Greek term for onyx, onyx was not mined prior to the era of classical Greece. "Onyx" is derived from the Greek for fingernail, due to the pink-white veining.{{#tag:ref|The Oxford English Dictionary, Webster's New International Dictionary (Second Edition), and The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (College Edition) state that "onyx" derives from the Greek term, "onux", meaning "(finger-)nail", "claw" or onyx-stone. The connection between "nail" or "claw" and the stone is that the onyx stone is usually found with a vein of white on pink background like the lunula of a fingernail. There is no indication in these or other desk dictionaries that the word "onyx" could be derived from a word meaning "ring".|group=Note}} In the Syriac Peshitta of the sixth or seventh century (MS. B.21, Inferiore of the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy), the word used to describe this stone is ܢܩܥܬܐ = naq'atha, a word which is sometimes transliterated into Arabic as it is pronounced in Aramaic, mainly by Arabic-speaking Christians. Bar-Ali, a 9th-century Arab author, brings down two opinions about this stone, the naq'atha, saying, by one opinion, that it is "honey-coloured", and by the other opinion that it is "turquoise, a blue-coloured stone". In some versions of the Peshitta, the Aramaic word rendered for the same stone is shabzez, translated as "diamond". This may account for today's understanding of this word, although in ancient times yahalom may have meant something else. Of the well-known honey-coloured gemstones, we find citrine and hessonite garnet (both from Sri Lanka), while in Africa (Tanzania) we find imperial zircon, a honey-coloured stone with extreme brilliance. Spanish Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra says the yahalom was a white stone.

 Third row Lešem (לֶשֶׁם = in the masoretic text) / Ligurios (in the Septuagint) – the names here seem to refer to places: Leshem and Liguria, respectively. Theophrastus mentions the fossilized pine resin, amber, called in Greek liggourrion or lyngurium, as does Dioscorides and Aëtius. In Greek antiquity, this stone was believed to have been the solidified urine of lynxes, and its name a mere corruption of lykos ouron, meaning white urine, presumably in reference to its colour. Pliny (who did not believe the stone existed) described the ligurios as having certain electrical properties, which a number of scholars have taken to imply that it referred to amber. Amber was one of the first items to have been discovered to have electrical properties (see Thales); the English stem electric- derives from the Latin word for amber (elektrum). In the Latin Vulgate the name was given as ligure, a Latinization apparently invented by Flavius Josephus, and equated with lyngurium, but Luther used hyacinth (jacinth), and during the Renaissance belief in lyngurium died away. Modern scholars are inclined to think that the stone must have been similar to the pale colour of natural gold (as opposed to the colour known as gold); The Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7) states that the mineral had a black colour, and is there named כוחלין, meaning the antimony known as stibium. Rabbi Saadia Gaon, and other medieval rabbinical commentators, argued that the gem itself was an onyx (Judeo-Arabic: גזע = جَزَع), although Abraham ibn Ezra casts doubt on the accuracy of Rabbi Saadia's tradition. Modern English translations use either amber or jacinth.Ševo (שְׁבוֹ = in the masoretic text) / Achates (in the Septuagint) – achates definitely refers to agate, and ševo may be cognate with the Assyrian term subu, meaning agate. Agates were common in Egypt and Assyria, and were regarded as a potent talismans. Isidore of Seville lists agate as being among the black gems. The Midrash Rabba (Numbers 2:7) appears to argue for the jewel in question having been a grey variety. Conversely, in Rabbi Saadia Gaon's (882–942 CE) Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, as well as in the medieval Samaritan Arabic translation, the stone is rendered as سبج, meaning obsidian.Aḥlamah (אַחְלָמָה = in the masoretic text) / Amethystos (in the Septuagint) – amethystos refers to amethyst, a purple mineral which was believed to protect against getting drunk from alcohol (amethyst's name refers to this belief, and literally translates as "not intoxicating"), and was commonly used in Egypt. Aḥlamah appears to be derived from a term meaning strong, though it may equally be derived from Ahlamu, a place where amethysts were found; in the Babylonian Targum, aḥlamah is translated into a term meaning strong drinking, which appears to reference beliefs about amethyst, but in the Jerusalem Targum, it is translated into a term meaning calf's eye. The Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), while describing the stone's colour, says: "[It is] similar to clear wine whose redness is not too strong."

 Fourth row Taršīš (תַּרְשִׁישִׁ = in the masoretic text) / Chrysolithos (in the Septuagint) – in some other places the Septuagint instead has anthrax (meaning coal) where the masoretic reads tarshish. taršīš is thought by scholars to refer to tarshish, in reference to the main source of the mineral being tarshish. Chrysolithos does not refer specifically to chrysolite, which was named much later, but is an adjective which translates as "gold-stone", meaning either that it was golden, as in the Libyan desert glass, or that it contained flecks of gold. With golden flecks it could refer to lapis lazuli, which would fit the Targums' description of the gem being "the colour of the sea". As a golden material if translucent, it could refer to topaz or to amber, and since chrysolithos came to mean topaz in particular by the classical era, some scholars favour this as being the most likely use, though it would be jarring for there to be two different translucent yellow gemstones so close to one another on the breastplate. If an opaque golden material, it could refer to a yellow form of jasper or of serpentine, which were commonly used in Egypt and Babylon. The 2nd century Jewish translator, Symmachus, renders the word as yakinthos, meaning "jacinth", or "hyacinth". There is little certainty among scholars in regard to which of these is the most likely to be the jewel in question.Šoham (שֹׁהַם = in the masoretic text) / Beryllios (in the Septuagint) – in some other places the Septuagint instead has onychion, or smaragdos, or the phrase leek-green stone, where the masoretic reads šoham; beryllios refers to beryl but earlier to the blue-green colour of the sea, onychion refers to onyx, and smaragdos literally means green stone and refers to a bright columnar crystal (either beryl or rock crystal). Onyx is an opaque and banded stone, while smaragdos is translucent, and beryl is cloudy, and all these come in several colours. Šoham could be derived from the Assyrian word samtu, meaning dark or cloudy; it could be derived from the Arabic word meaning pale, in which case it fits more with onyx and certain forms of beryl, excluding the emerald, with Heliodor being the form of beryl fitting the leek green description; it could be derived from the Arabic word musahham, meaning striped garment, and therefore very definitely describing something like onyx; or it could be a place name, for example there is a place in Yemen named Soheim. Jewish tradition generally favours leek-green beryl (heliodor) as the likely meaning of šoham, though scholars think it is more likely to be malachite, which can be green enough to be compared to smaragdos and the blue-green colour of the sea (the original meaning of beryllios), is cloudy enough to be compared to a cloudy form of beryl, and is striped and opaque enough to be confused with a form of onyx. According to Epiphanius’ Treatise on the Twelve Stones (Epiphanius de Gemmis), the beryl was "white like a cloud". Scholars point out that the Syriac form of the word is berūlā and/or belūra, the latter evidently going back to a Pahlevi form (the old Persian tongue), and all in turn to the Sanskrit वैडूर्य = vaiḍūrya (Pali: veḷuriyaṁ), the gemstone which is called in English, "cat's eye, beryl", a variety of chalcedonic quartz that has a chatoyant lustre resembling the eye of a cat when cut.Yāšǝfêh (יָשְׁפֵה = in the masoretic text) / Iaspis (in the Septuagint and Josephus). Although yāšǝfêh and iaspis are cognate to jasper, they do not quite have the same meaning; while jasper is usually red, the mineral which the Greeks called iaspis was generally a richly green one (the most prized form of jasper), and scholars think this is most likely to be the colour referred to by yāšǝfêh; the ambiguity of the term is present in the Targums, where the jewel is variously identified as a ruby (which is red), as a hyacinth (which is yellow), or as an emerald (which is green). In the Babylonian Talmud, one opinion states that the gemstone was the same as kadkhod, a stone described by Bar-Ali as being al-karkahan = الكركھن (the Baghdadi onyx), "a kind of gemstone from which they cut [smaller] stones for setting in ouches". Rabbi Saadia Gaon, however, in his Judeo-Arabic translation of Isaiah, translates kadkhod as karkand, a red variety of precious stone. Josephus, quoting from one version of the Septuagint, says that it was a beryl. Numbers Rabba 2:7 says that the stone was varicolored, meaning, all of the colors combined were to be found in the yāšǝfêh.

 12 jewels in the New Testament 
In the New Testament Book of Revelation is the description of a city wall, with each layer of stones in the wall being from a different material; in the original Koine Greek, the layers are given as iaspis, sapphiros, chalcedon, smaragdos, sardonyx, sardion, chrysolithos, beryllos, topazion, chrysoprason, yacinthos, amethystos. This list appears to be based on the Septuagint's version of the list of jewels in the Breastplate – if the top half of the breastplate was rotated by 180 degrees, and the bottom half turned upside down, with Onchion additionally swapping places with Topazion, the lists become extremely similar; there are only four differences:
 Onchion (literally onyx) has become sardonyx (red onyx)
 Anthrax has become chalcedon (literally meaning chalcedony, of which the red variety is the most common). Anthrax literally means coal, presumably meaning the red colour of burning coal.
 Ligurios has become chrysoprason. Scholars suspect that ligurios was a pale yellowish mineral, and although chrysoprase now refers to a specific gemstone which is generally apple-green in colour, in earlier times it referred to gems of a yellowish leek-green, such as peridot; chrysoprase literally means golden leek.
 Achates (agate) has been replaced by yacinthos (jacinth). According to classical rabbinical literature, the specific agate was of a sky-blue colour, and though jacinth now refers to a red-tinted clear gem, this was not the case at the time the Book of Revelation was written, and at that time jacinth appears to have referred to a bluish gem; Pliny describes jacinth as a dull and blueish amethyst, while Solinus describes it as a clear blue tinted gem – the modern sapphire.

Pattern
Whether there is any pattern to the choice of gemstones depends on their identity. Taking the majority view of scholars in regard to the identity of the gems, and including the implication from the Book of Revelation that the onyx at the end of the fourth row was a sardonyx'', there are four colours – red, green, yellow, and blue – each represented by a clear gem (red – carbuncle, green – heliodor, yellow – chrysolite, blue – amethyst), an opaque gem (red – carnelian/red jasper, green – green jasper, yellow – yellow jasper/yellow serpentine, blue – lapis lazuli), and a striped gem (red – sardonyx, green – malachite, yellow – pale golden agate, blue – sky-blue agate). The four colours of red, green, yellow, and blue, are the first four colours (apart from black and white) distinguished by languages, and are distinguished in all cultures with at least six colour distinctions (the other two being black and white). These colours roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells. (The retinal ganglia process colour by positioning it within a blue to yellow range, and separately positioning it within a red to green range.)
Digital Performer is a digital audio workstation and music sequencer software package published by Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU) of Cambridge, Massachusetts for the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms.

Ancestry
In 1984, Mark of the Unicorn released Professional Composer, one of the first application programs for the Apple Macintosh. The program used the Macintosh's high-resolution graphics and printing to allow the user to print professional quality music scores.

In 1985, the company released a music sequencer named Performer, also based on the Macintosh platform, for arranging and performing with synthesizers and other devices which recognized the then-newly developed MIDI standard. Sending a series of numerical values, such a sequencer could direct many instruments, commanding which notes to play, at what loudness, and for how long to sustain them. There are many deep features in the MIDI protocol; MOTU developed extended capabilities in Digital Performer for handling these controllers and other actions (including remote operation of the software itself) through user-customizable graphical consoles, allowing the operator direct access to deeper features of instruments, stage lighting and various types of machines, all via MIDI interfaces and custom graphic buttons and sliders.

Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) 
In 1990, MOTU added the ability to synchronise audio (digital audio) to Performer and released it as "Digital Performer," months after Opcode added this capability to Vision. Digital Performer was originally designed as a front-end to Digidesign's Audiomedia hard disk recording system, which later became Pro Tools. Digital Performer's specific appeal was its MIDI environment, which was fitted into the same transport system as the audio environment. This enabled users to record their MIDI instruments and mix the results with other live audio recorded in the studio (or vice versa). Personal computers of this time were too slow to handle high quality recording via their own CPU, so the addition of Digital signal processing co-processor cards was necessary to create a functioning audio recording studio. As the Mac's CPU became powerful enough to record the digitized audio directly to hard disk, the DSP cards were gradually rendered unnecessary. Foreseeing this, MOTU created its own Motu Audio System (MAS) which helped Digital Performer to tap the Macintosh's native power to record music directly to its own hard drive without the need for external co-processing and dedicated drives. By 2000, Digital Performer allowed users to record, mix, and master audio for commercial releases.

Version history
Version 3 of Digital Performer was the last to run on Mac OS 9, the Classic Macintosh operating system. After a complete rewrite, MOTU released Digital Performer 4.0 in May 2003, which ran exclusively on Mac OS X.

Beginning with version 4.5, MOTU introduced a number of important new features to Digital Performer. The two most important of these are built in pitch correction capability, and the professional Masterworks EQ plugin. Beginning with version 5.0, MOTU also introduced a set of virtual instruments. The software was updated to version 5.13 on 19 November 2007 to provide compatibility with Mac OS X v10.5. and available in Universal Binary.

Version 7.2 was introduced in 2010. Digital Performer remains one of the popular audio workstations on the Macintosh. Faster Apple CPUs continue to increase its capacity and performance. Chief among its competition on the Macintosh platform are Pro Tools and Apple's Logic.

In October 2012, MOTU released Digital Performer 8 for OSX. Digital Performer 8 is available on Windows as well.

Version 9 of Digital Performer was released in June 2015 for Mac OS X and Windows. This version contains workflow enhancements, some new effect plugins, including emulations of the 1176 Peak Limiter and Craig Anderton's MultiFuzz. MOTU also included a 64-bit version of its software synth (synthesizer) MX4 which used to be sold as a stand-alone product.

Version 10 of Digital Performer was released in February 2019 for Mac OS X and Windows. This version includes a new 5 GB instruments soundbank, a time/pitch audio stretching feature, and a real time loop triggering function.

AudioDesk
AudioDesk is a more basic version of MOTU's Digital Performer for mac only. It is a multi-track recording, editing, and mixing application, with both offline file-based processing and realtime effects. Much of the graphical user interface (GUI) and its operation are similar to Digital Performer, although it lacks some of Digital Performer's features.  Most notably, it does not include MIDI sequencing capabilities, and thus does not include some of Digital Performer's MIDI-specific editing windows. Also, AudioDesk is only available as a bundled application with MOTU audio interfaces; this also means that AudioDesk requires a MOTU audio interface to be used as its soundcard.

AudioDesk version 1 was first released in 1998, as bundled software with the MOTU 2408 PCI-based audio interface. Version 1 is compatible with the Classic Mac OS. Version 2 for Mac OS X was released in 2003, with numerous updates (many of which corresponded to updates from Digital Performer 3 for the Classic Mac OS to Digital Performer 4 for Mac OS X).

The Leizhou Peninsula, alternately romanized as the Luichow Peninsula, is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Guangdong province in South China.

History
Qing naval forces were stationed at the Leizhou Peninsula. During the 19th century, the area was a hotbed of piracy, many pirates, such as Zheng Yi and Wu Shi Er, were based in the area.

Geography
The Leizhou Peninsula is the third largest peninsula in China with an area of c.  located on the southwestern end of Zhanjiang, Guangdong with the Gulf of Tonkin to the west and the 30 km wide Qiongzhou Strait to the south, separating the peninsula from Hainan Island.

Geologically, basalt terraces account for 43% of the peninsula's area. The rest is divided up between marine terraces (27%) and alluvial plains (17%). Leizhou Peninsula is dotted with a few dormant volcanoes, beaches, and low-lying diluvial plains.

Leizhou has two separate volcanic fields: a Pleistocene–Holocene field at the northern end of the peninsula west of Zhanjiang  Leibei Huoshanqun) and the northern end of the Qionglei or Leiqiong volcanic field, which extends across the strait into northern Hainan   Leinan Huoshanqun). The volcanoes derive from the east-to-west tectonic extension and thinning of the lithosphere connected with the creation of the South China Sea's basin. Two Pleistocene-era basaltic stratovolcanoes are Yingfengling  and Tianyang   apart in the center of the peninsula. There is also a third volcanic field responsible for some of the islands offshore  Huoshanyan Daoyu).

Wildlife
Hepu National Sanctuary of Dugongs was created west of the peninsula to protect endangered wildlife especially marine mammals. Vicinity to the peninsula, such as the Leizhou Bay has declared to be parts of the Chinese white dolphin sanctuary holding the second largest population in the nation. Dugongs still occur in small number. Some Bryde's whales, minke whales, and whale sharks still occur in the adjacent waters including Hainan Island and Gulf of Tonkin waters such as off Tieshangang District, Islands of Weizhou and Xieyang.

Critically endangered whales such as North Pacific right whales and western gray whales, humpback whales, and blue whales were once known to occur around the peninsula in the winter and spring to calve. Waters such as Wailuo Harbor were ideal habitats for these giants. These whales were heavily hunted and were wiped out by Japanese whalers in this regions. (Japanese whalers established whaling stations at various sites along the Chinese and Korean coasts including on the island of Hainan and at Daya Bay).

Climate
The peninsula lies in tropical South China. The region is under the influence of continental northeastern monsoons and maritime southeastern and southwestern monsoons. Typhoons occasionally occur, both from the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Annual precipitation is .

Towns
 Kouang Tchéou Wan, former French colony on the north-eastern coast of the peninsula
 Zhanjiang, a port city on the north-eastern coast
Pennies from Heaven is a 1978 BBC musical drama serial written by Dennis Potter. The title is taken from the song "Pennies from Heaven" written by Johnny Burke and Arthur Johnston. It was one of several Potter serials (another being The Singing Detective) to mix the reality of the drama with a dark fantasy content, and the earliest of his works where the characters burst into extended performances of popular songs.

Overview
Hoskins became an established actor in the United Kingdom following his role in this serial. The serial was directed by Piers Haggard and produced by Potter collaborator Kenith Trodd. The series also featured Nigel Havers as Conrad Baker (the suave salesman), Jenny Logan as Irene (Joan's friend), Freddie Jones as Mr. Warner (Eileen's headmaster), Michael Bilton as Eileen's dad, Will Stamp as the Barman, Tudor Davies as the cafe customer (Davies was also choreographer for the series), and Peter Bowles as the Prosecuting Counsel.

Pennies was the last of Potter's television dramas to be filmed in the 'hybrid' format of studio videotape and location 16 mm film. The production involved six weeks of filming on location, most of it in Oxfordshire, with selected shooting in the Forest of Dean (in Potter's home county of Gloucestershire, between the River Severn and the River Wye). The school where Eileen teaches is the Forest school Potter attended in Berry Hill and the children who populate the school scenes were local children cast as extras. In temporary remission from his chronic condition of psoriatic arthropathy, a rare skin and joints disease that first afflicted him at the age of 24, Potter and his wife Margaret were able to visit the location shoot in Dean.

Pennies... was transmitted in six episodes of approximately 75 minutes each from 7 March to 11 April 1978, on BBC1 and first repeated later that year. In spring of the following year, Pennies won the British Academy Television Award for Most Original Programme (Hoskins & Campbell were also nominated for BAFTA acting awards). In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, Pennies from Heaven was placed at number 21.

Legacy
The original television version was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2004. The first and sixth episodes have an audio commentary from Haggard and Trodd.

Potter's memorial service in November 1994 at St James's Church in Piccadilly began with those in attendance singing "Roll Along Prairie Moon" to the accompaniment of a jazz quintet. Cheryl Campbell and Freddie Jones read their scene in the schoolroom from Pennies: "As Jones stifled his tears, Campbell said: 'Nobody ever ever stops yearning' . . . In a comic interlude Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Alan Yentob, controller of BBC1, and Kenith Trodd, Potter's producer, read a scene from Pennies. [And Trodd] told of their last meeting before the playwright's death from cancer: 'Dennis slugging Courvoisier, fortified by liquid heroin and morphine . . . after an hour he seemed to crumple and he said, 'I do have one very real fear of death. It is that you might get asked to speak at my memorial service'."

Episodes

Film adaptation

In 1981, the series was adapted as a film, starring Steve Martin. Potter adapted his own screenplay, and Herbert Ross directed. Potter was nominated for the 1981 Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay – according to The Times, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had him rewrite the script thirteen times. The movie was not successful at the box office, despite featuring Bernadette Peters (as Eileen), Christopher Walken (as Tom) and Vernel Bagneris (as 'the accordion man').

MGM required Potter to buy back his copyright from the BBC (according to the same 1990 Times article, Potter paid the BBC "something over $100,000" for the script), and prohibited broadcast of the BBC production of Pennies for approximately ten years. In 1989, Trodd was able to buy back the rights from MGM. The BBC promptly rebroadcast Pennies in February 1990.

The ΛCDM (Lambda cold dark matter) or Lambda-CDM model is a parameterization of the Big Bang cosmological model in which the universe contains three major components: first, a cosmological constant denoted by Lambda (Greek Λ) associated with dark energy; second, the postulated cold dark matter (abbreviated CDM); and third, ordinary matter. It is frequently referred to as the standard model of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:

 the existence and structure of the cosmic microwave background
 the large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies
 the observed abundances of hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium
 the accelerating expansion of the universe observed in the light from distant galaxies and supernovae

The model assumes that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.   It emerged in the late 1990s as a concordance cosmology, after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding cosmological inflation, quintessence, and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are modified Newtonian dynamics, entropic gravity, modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, bimetric gravity, scale invariance of empty space, and decaying dark matter (DDM).

Overview

The ΛCDM model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the red shift of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a Doppler shift in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter Λ (lambda) represents the cosmological constant, which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or dark energy in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, , which contributes to the stress–energy tensor that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, , is estimated to be 0.669 ± 0.038 based on the 2018 Dark Energy Survey results using Type Ia Supernovae or  0.6847 ± 0.0073 based on the 2018 release of Planck satellite data, or more than 68.3% (2018 estimate) of the mass–energy density of the universe.

Dark matter is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" rotation curves of galaxies; the gravitational lensing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter.

Cold dark matter as currently hypothesized is:
non-baryonic It consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons).
cold Its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation–matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold).
dissipationless It cannot cool by radiating photons.
collisionless The dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force.

Dark matter constitutes about 26.5% of the mass–energy density of the universe. The remaining 4.9% comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass–energy density of the universe.

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in relic neutrinos. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift > 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding spacetime containing radiation at temperatures of around 1015 K. This was immediately (within 10−29 seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 1027 or more, known as cosmic inflation. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual cosmic microwave background, or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of lighter elements in the universe (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities (anisotropies) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "horizon problem" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable particle horizon.

The model uses the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, the Friedmann equations and the cosmological equations of state to describe the observable universe from right after the inflationary epoch to present and future.

Cosmic expansion history
The expansion of the universe is parameterized by a dimensionless scale factor  (with time  counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so ; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so  is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed redshift  of the light emitted at time  by

The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent Hubble parameter, , defined as

where  is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first Friedmann equation gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density  the curvature  and the cosmological constant 

where as usual  is the speed of light and  is the gravitational constant. 
A critical density  is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature , assuming the cosmological constant  is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

where  is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a Big Crunch, or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the dark energy is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day density parameter  for various species as the dimensionless ratio

where the subscript  is one of  for baryons,  for cold dark matter,   for radiation (photons plus relativistic neutrinos), and  for dark energy.

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of , e.g.  for matter etc.,
the Friedmann equation can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as

where  is the equation of state parameter of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various  parameters add up to  by construction. In the general case this is integrated by computer to give the expansion history  and also observable distance–redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature  is zero and , so this simplifies to

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, ; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution

where 
this is fairly accurate for  or  million years.
Solving for  gives the present age of the universe  in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative  crossing zero) occurred when

which evaluates to  or  for the best-fit parameters estimated from the Planck spacecraft.

Historical development
The discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the Big Bang cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density.

During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of cosmic inflation motivated models with critical density.

During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988–1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted.

These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by the Cosmic Background Explorer in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of accelerating expansion in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the BOOMERanG microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the 2dFGRS galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or dark energy. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from WMAP in 2003–2010 and Planck in 2013–2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and to resolve the tensions between recent observations and the ΛCDM model, such as the Hubble tension and the CMB dipole. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination.

Historically, a large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but recent observations that contradict the ΛCDM model have recently led some astronomers and astrophysicists to search for alternatives to the ΛCDM model, which include dropping the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric or modifying dark energy. On the other hand, Milgrom, McGaugh, and Kroupa have long been leading critics of the ΛCDM model, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of galaxy formation models and supporting the alternative modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory, which requires a modification of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations as seen in proposals such as modified gravity theory (MOG theory) or tensor–vector–scalar gravity theory (TeVeS theory). Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include f(R) gravity, scalar–tensor theories such as galileon theories, brane cosmologies, the DGP model, and massive gravity and its extensions such as bimetric gravity.

Successes
In addition to explaining many pre-2000 observations, the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak gravitational lensing, first observed in 2000 by several teams. The polarization of the CMB, discovered in 2002 by DASI, has been successfully predicted by the model: in the 2015 Planck data release, there are seven observed peaks in the temperature (TT) power spectrum, six peaks in the temperature–polarization (TE) cross spectrum, and five peaks in the polarization (EE) spectrum. The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed.

Challenges
Over the years, numerous simulations of ΛCDM and observations of our universe have been made that challenge the validity of the ΛCDM model, to the point where some cosmologists now believe that the ΛCDM model may be superseded by another standard cosmological model.

Lack of detection
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection, while dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is unnaturally small compared to vacuum energy theoretical predictions.

Violations of the cosmological principle

The ΛCDM model has been shown to satisfy the cosmological principle, which states that, on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions (isotropy) and from every location (homogeneity); "the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are." The cosmological principle exists because when the predecessors of the ΛCDM model were first being developed, there was not sufficient data available to distinguish between more complex anisotropic or inhomogeneous models, so homogeneity and isotropy were assumed to simplify the models, and the assumptions were carried over into the ΛCDM model. However, recent findings have suggested that violations of the cosmological principle, especially of isotropy, exist. These violations have called the ΛCDM model into question, with some authors suggesting that the cosmological principle is now obsolete or that the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric breaks down in the late universe. This has additional implications for the validity of the cosmological constant in the ΛCDM model, as dark energy is implied by observations only if the cosmological principle is true.

Violations of isotropy
Evidence from galaxy clusters, quasars, and type Ia supernovae suggest that isotropy is violated on large scales.

Data from the Planck Mission shows hemispheric bias in the cosmic microwave background in two respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities). The European Space Agency (the governing body of the Planck Mission) has concluded that these anisotropies in the CMB are, in fact, statistically significant and can no longer be ignored.

Already in 1967, Dennis Sciama predicted that the cosmic microwave background has a significant dipole anisotropy. In recent years, the CMB dipole has been tested, and current results suggest our motion with respect to distant radio galaxies and quasars differs from our motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background. The same conclusion has been reached in recent studies of the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae and quasars. This contradicts the cosmological principle.

The CMB dipole is hinted at through a number of other observations. First, even within the cosmic microwave background, there are curious directional alignments and an anomalous parity asymmetry that may have an origin in the CMB dipole. Separately, the CMB dipole direction has emerged as a preferred direction in studies of alignments in quasar polarizations, scaling relations in galaxy clusters, strong lensing time delay, Type Ia supernovae, and quasars and gamma-ray bursts as standard candles. The fact that all these independent observables, based on different physics, are tracking the CMB dipole direction suggests that the Universe is anisotropic in the direction of the CMB dipole.

Nevertheless, some authors have stated that the universe around Earth is isotropic at high significance by studies of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps.

Violations of homogeneity
Based on N-body simulations in ΛCDM, Yadav and his colleagues showed that the spatial distribution of galaxies is statistically homogeneous if averaged over scales 260/h Mpc or more. However, many large-scale structures have been discovered, and some authors have reported some of the structures to be in conflict with the predicted scale of homogeneity for ΛCDM, including
 The Clowes–Campusano LQG, discovered in 1991, which has a length of 580 Mpc
 The Sloan Great Wall, discovered in 2003, which has a length of 423 Mpc, 
 U1.11, a large quasar group discovered in 2011, which has a length of 780 Mpc
 The Huge-LQG, discovered in 2012, which is three times longer than and twice as wide as is predicted possible according to ΛCDM
 The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall, discovered in November 2013, which has a length of 2000–3000 Mpc (more than seven times that of the SGW)
The Giant Arc, discovered in June 2021, which has a length of 1000 Mpc

Other authors claim that the existence of structures larger than the scale of homogeneity in the ΛCDM model does not necessarily violate the cosmological principle in the ΛCDM model.

El Gordo galaxy cluster collision

El Gordo is an interacting galaxy cluster in the early Universe. The extreme properties of El Gordo in terms of its redshift, mass, and the collision velocity leads to strong tension with the ΛCDM model. The properties of El Gordo are however consistent with cosmological simulations in the framework of MOND due to more rapid structure formation.

KBC void

The KBC void is an immense, comparatively empty region of space containing the Milky Way approximately 2 billion light-years (600 megaparsecs, Mpc) in diameter. Some authors have said the existence of the KBC void violates the assumption that the CMB reflects baryonic density fluctuations at  or Einstein's theory of general relativity, either of which would violate the ΛCDM model, while other authors have claimed that supervoids as large as the KBC void are consistent with the ΛCDM model.

Hubble tension

The Hubble tension in cosmology is widely acknowledged to be a major problem for the ΛCDM model. In December 2021, National Geographic reported that the cause of the Hubble tension discrepancy is not known. However, if the cosmological principle fails (see Violations of the cosmological principle), then the existing interpretations of the Hubble constant and the Hubble tension have to be revised, which might resolve the Hubble tension.

Some authors postulate that the Hubble tension can be explained entirely by the KBC void, as measuring galactic supernovae inside a void is predicted by the authors to yield a larger local value for the Hubble constant than cosmological measures of the Hubble constant. However, other work has found no evidence for this in observations, finding the scale of the claimed underdensity to be incompatible with observations which extend beyond its radius. Important deficiencies were subsequently pointed out in this analysis, leaving open the possibility that the Hubble tension is indeed caused by outflow from the KBC void.

As a result of the Hubble tension, other researchers have called for new physics beyond the ΛCDM model. Moritz Haslbauer et al. proposed that MOND would resolve the Hubble tension. Another group of researchers led by Marc Kamionkowski proposed a cosmological model with early dark energy to replace ΛCDM.

S8 tension
The  tension in cosmology is another major problem for the ΛCDM model. The  parameter in the ΛCDM model quantifies the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the late universe and is defined as

Early- (e.g. from CMB data collected using the Planck observatory) and late-time (e.g. measuring weak gravitational lensing events) facilitate increasingly precise values of . However, these two categories of measurement differ by more standard deviations than their uncertainties. This discrepancy is called the  tension. The name "tension" reflects that the disagreement is not merely between two data sets: the many sets of early- and late-time measurements agree well within their own categories, but there is an unexplained difference between values obtained from different points in the evolution of the universe. Such a tension indicates that the ΛCDM model may be incomplete or in need of correction.

Axis of evil

The ΛCDM model assumes that the data of the cosmic microwave background and our interpretation of the CMB are correct. However, there exists an apparent correlation between the plane of the Solar System, the rotation of galaxies, and certain aspects of the CMB. This may indicate that there is something wrong with the data or the interpretation of the cosmic microwave background used as evidence for the ΛCDM model, or that the Copernican principle and cosmological principle are violated.

Cosmological lithium problem

The actual observable amount of lithium in the universe is less than the calculated amount from the ΛCDM model by a factor of 3–4. If every calculation is correct, then solutions beyond the existing ΛCDM model might be needed.

Shape of the universe

The ΛCDM model assumes that the shape of the universe is flat (zero curvature). However, recent Planck data have hinted that the shape of the universe might in fact be closed (positive curvature), which would contradict the ΛCDM model. Some authors have suggested that the Planck data detecting a positive curvature could be evidence of a local inhomogeneity in the curvature of the universe rather than the universe actually being closed.

Violations of the strong equivalence principle

The ΛCDM model assumes that the strong equivalence principle is true. However, in 2020 a group of astronomers analyzed data from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) sample, together with estimates of the large-scale external gravitational field from an all-sky galaxy catalog. They concluded that there was highly statistically significant evidence of violations of the strong equivalence principle in weak gravitational fields in the vicinity of rotationally supported galaxies. They observed an effect inconsistent with tidal effects in the ΛCDM model.

Cold dark matter discrepancies

Several discrepancies between the predictions of cold dark matter in the ΛCDM model and observations of galaxies and their clustering have arisen. Some of these problems have proposed solutions, but it remains unclear whether they can be solved without abandoning the ΛCDM model.

Cuspy halo problem

The density distributions of dark matter halos in cold dark matter simulations (at least those that do not include the impact of baryonic feedback) are much more peaked than what is observed in galaxies by investigating their rotation curves.

Dwarf galaxy problem
 
Cold dark matter simulations predict large numbers of small dark matter halos, more numerous than the number of small dwarf galaxies that are observed around galaxies like the Milky Way.

Satellite disk problem
Dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are observed to be orbiting in thin, planar structures whereas the simulations predict that they should be distributed randomly about their parent galaxies. However, latest research suggests this seemingly bizarre alignment is just a quirk which will dissolve over time.

High-velocity galaxy problem
Galaxies in the NGC 3109 association are moving away too rapidly to be consistent with expectations in the ΛCDM model. In this framework, NGC 3109 is too massive and distant from the Local Group for it to have been flung out in a three-body interaction involving the Milky Way or Andromeda Galaxy.

Galaxy morphology problem
If galaxies grew hierarchically, then massive galaxies required many mergers. Major mergers inevitably create a classical bulge. On the contrary, about 80% of observed galaxies give evidence of no such bulges, and giant pure-disc galaxies are commonplace. The tension can be quantified by comparing the observed distribution of galaxy shapes today with predictions from high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulations in the ΛCDM framework, revealing a highly significant problem that is unlikely to be solved by improving the resolution of the simulations. The high bulgeless fraction was nearly constant for 8 billion years.

Fast galaxy bar problem
If galaxies were embedded within massive halos of cold dark matter, then the bars that often develop in their central regions would be slowed down by dynamical friction with the halo. This is in serious tension with the fact that observed galaxy bars are typically fast.

Small scale crisis
Comparison of the model with observations may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting too many dwarf galaxies and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".  These small scales are harder to resolve in computer simulations, so it is not yet clear whether the problem is the simulations, non-standard properties of dark matter, or a more radical error in the model.

High redshift galaxies
Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have resulted in various galaxies confirmed by spectroscopy at high redshift, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 at cosmological redshift of 13.2. Other candidate galaxies which have not been confirmed by spectroscopy include CEERS-93316 at cosmological redshift of 16.4. 

Existence of surprisingly massive galaxies in the early universe challenges the currently preferred models describing how dark matter halos drive galaxy formation. It remains to be seen whether a revision of the Lambda-CDM model with parameters given by Planck Collaboration is necessary to resolve this issue. The discrepancies could also be explained by particular properties (stellar masses or effective volume) of the candidate galaxies, yet unknown force or particle outside of the Standard Model through which dark matter interacts, more efficient baryonic matter accumulation by the dark matter halos, early dark energy models, or the hypothesized long-sought Population III stars.

Missing baryon problem

Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci first estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following), weighted with the luminosity function  over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects:

The result was:

where .

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis , so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

The missing baryon problem is claimed to be resolved. Using observations of the kinematic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect spanning more than 90% of the lifetime of the Universe, in 2021 astrophysicists found that approximately 50% of all baryonic matter is outside dark matter haloes, filling the space between galaxies. Together with the amount of baryons inside galaxies and surrounding these, the total amount of baryons in the late time Universe is now compatible with early Universe measurements.

Unfalsifiability
It has been argued that the ΛCDM model is built upon a foundation of conventionalist stratagems, rendering it unfalsifiable in the sense defined by Karl Popper.

Parameters
 

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six parameters: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth. In accordance with Occam's razor, six is the smallest number of parameters needed to give an acceptable fit to current observations; other possible parameters are fixed at "natural" values, e.g. total density parameter = 1.00, dark energy equation of state = −1. (See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "Theory of Everything"), except that most versions of cosmic inflation predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

Parameter values listed below are from the Planck Collaboration Cosmological parameters 68% confidence limits for the base ΛCDM model from Planck CMB power spectra, in combination with lensing reconstruction and external data (BAO + JLA + H0). See also Planck (spacecraft).

Extended models

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (may be different from 1); or quintessence rather than a cosmological constant where the equation of state of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow hot dark matter in the form of neutrinos more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally increase the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio  should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.
Keetmanshoop is a town in the ǁKaras Region of southern Namibia, lying on the Trans-Namib Railway from Windhoek to Upington in South Africa. It is named after Johann Keetman, a German industrialist and benefactor of the city.

History 

Before the colonial era, the settlement was known as ǂNuǂgoaes or Swartmodder, both meaning "Black Marsh" and indicating the presence of a spring in the area. The first white settler, Guilliam Visagie, arrived here in 1785. When in February 1850 the Kharoǃoan clan (Keetmanshoop Nama) split from the Red Nation, the main subtribe of the Nama people, they settled permanently in the area. In 1860 the Rhenish Missionary Society founded a mission there to christianise the local Nama people. The first missionary, Johann Georg Schröder, arrived in Keetmanshoop on April 14, 1866, which is now marked as the founding date of Keetmanshoop. The mission station was named after the German trader and director of the Rhenish Missionary Society, , who supported the mission financially, although he never actually visited the place himself.

Notable buildings and structures

The Rhenish Missionary Church was erected in 1895 and now also contains a museum. It was declared a historic monument in 1978 and is a well-known landmark. Its unique combination of Gothic architecture cast in African stone makes it one of the architectural masterpieces in the country and a popular tourist attraction. Other notable buildings are the Schützenhaus (marksmen's club house, 1905–07), the railway station building (1908) and the Imperial Post Office (now the Keetmanshoop tourist information, erected in 1910).

The town is situated near two quiver tree forests, one of them being a national monument and a major tourist attraction of Namibia. Also close to Keetmanshoop is the Naute Dam and the Neckertal Dam - largest dam in the country.

The J. Stephanus Stadium is located in Keetmanshoop and is home to Fedics United F.C., a football team in the Namibia Premier League.

Keetmanshoop is an important center for the Karakul sheep farming community.

Politics
Keetmanshoop is governed by a municipality council that  has seven seats.

In the 2010 local authority election, a total of 3,156 votes were cast in the city. SWAPO won with approximately 48% of the vote. Of the three other parties seeking votes in the election, Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) received approximately 35% of the vote, followed by the Democratic Party of Namibia (DPN, 10%) and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 7%).

The 2015 local authority election was won by SWAPO by a much larger margin. SWAPO accumulated 2,337 votes and won five seats in the municipal council. DTA (538 votes) and RDP (186 votes) gained one seat each.

The 2020 Namibian local authority election was won by LPM. LPM accumulated 3,619 votes and won five seats in the municipal council. SWAPO (1648 votes) gained two seats.

Geography

Climate 
Keetmanshoop has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with long, very hot summers and cold winters. The annual average rainfall is only . Keetmanshoop is one of the sunniest places year-round on the planet with a mean sunshine duration over 3,870 hours yearly or 10.7 sunny hours daily - well above 87% of the time. The annual mean temperature is 21.1 °C (70.0 °F) with a mean annual high of 28.8 °C (83.8 °F) and a low of 13.3 °C (55.9 °F). The climate is characterized by sunshine and dryness as well as moderate heat all year long.

The Boys from Syracuse is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart, based on William Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors, as adapted by librettist George Abbott.  The score includes swing and other contemporary rhythms of the 1930s.  The show was the first musical based on a Shakespeare play. The Comedy of Errors was itself loosely based on a Roman play, The Menaechmi, or the Twin Brothers, by Plautus.

The show premiered on Broadway in 1938 and Off-Broadway in 1963, with later productions including a West End run in 1963 and in a Broadway revival in 2002.  A film adaptation was released in 1940.  Well-known songs from the score include "Falling in Love with Love", "This Can't Be Love" and "Sing for Your Supper".

Production history
Abbott directed and George Balanchine choreographed the original production, which opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theater on November 23, 1938, after tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut and Boston.

Plot
Identical twins Antipholus of Ephesus and Antipholus of Syracuse were separated from each other  in a shipwreck as young children.  Their servants, both named Dromio, are also long-separated identical twins.  When the pair from Syracuse come to Ephesus, a comedy of errors and mistaken identities ensues when the wives of the Ephesians, Adriana and her servant Luce, mistake the two strangers for their husbands.  Adriana's sister Luciana and the Syracuse Antipholus fall in love.  But all ends happily.

ABC NewsRadio, since 2017 broadcast under the ABC News brand and for a short time known as ABC News on Radio, is a  24-hour news radio service broadcast by the Australian public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). ABC NewsRadio is available via a number of platforms around Australia, including AM/FM radio, online via web or the ABC Listen app, DAB+ radio, free-to-air digital TV, and some pay-TV platforms.

The origins of the radio station lie in the statutory obligation of the ABC to live-broadcast all Australian Parliamentary sessions, which were originally (from 1946) broadcast on its national radio network. In 1988, the Parliamentary Broadcasting Network (PBN) was established as a dedicated parliamentary radio station; in August 1994 this station's frequencies were used to provide news broadcasting when Parliament was not in session, and Parliamentary and News Network (PNN), the forerunner of ABC NewsRadio, was born.

History

Background
Legislation passed in 1946 (the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946) requiring the ABC to broadcast Parliament live when in session. The legislation does not determine the name of the network. Parliamentary broadcasting was commenced under Ben Chifley's government on 10 July 1946, of Question Time. The broadcasts were put onto the single nationally broadcast radio network; however, the Commission frequently commented on the disruption this caused to its programming in its annual reports.

1988: PBN
In August 1988, the Parliamentary Broadcast Network (PBN) was established under the National Metropolitan Radio Plan, as a dedicated network to carry the ABC's mandatory Parliamentary broadcasts on AM transmitters in each state capital as well as Newcastle and Canberra.

1994: PNN
In May 1994 the Interim Report of the Inquiry into the Radio and Television Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings was published, supporting the ABC's proposal to provide news on the PBN. The expanded service would be called the Parliamentary and News Network (PNN). 

On 15 August 1994 PNN was launched to provide a continuous news network broadcast on the same frequencies used by the PBN, when Parliament was not sitting, with the service expanding the service to Darwin, Northern Territory in March 1997 to complete its coverage to all capital cities. in the 1996–7 financial year,  "ABC NewsRadio on the Parliamentary and News Network" showed the strongest growth of any ABC network, increasing its weekly reach to 397,000 listeners nationally, up 44.9%. (The news service was known for some time as ABC NewsRadio on the Parliamentary and News Network, with the last six words from in parentheses for a few years before being dropped completely in 2010.)

Despite the use of the network by ABC NewsRadio, the PNN exists independent of it. The PNN falls under the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946. Parliamentary proceedings must be broadcast on the network defined by the Act.

21st century: other platforms
From September 2001, the 24-hour rolling news format began with live audio streaming on the Internet.

ABC NewsRadio began to continue its news programming online while its radio network broadcast parliament in 2002. The service also expanded into the Gold Coast – the first new coverage area for the network in five years.

From 2009, the service was extended to digital radio, first in the capital cities and then rolled out to regional Australia. and subscription TV services. FM transmission was expanded greatly during a 2006-2009 program. It planned to increase the AM/FM coverage from 78% of the population to 95%. In 2009, separate standard and parliamentary feeds were launched on digital terrestrial (DAB+) radio in the state capitals.

In November 2016, the ABC announced that ABC NewsRadio and ABC News 24 rebranded as ABC News on 10 April 2017. The ABC announced on that day that ABC News 24 and ABC NewsRadio were both called ABC NEWS, with a new logo and visual branding. They would be distinguished by context or by descriptors, such as "the ABC News channel" for TV and "ABC News on radio" for radio. Social media accounts would be merged.

Content and format
ABC NewsRadio broadcasts every session live from the House of Representatives and the Senate, and a delayed broadcast of parliamentary question time in the evening, on the AM/FM radio network, and is not streamed online or broadcast on digital radio.

ABC NewsRadio has a 24-hour news format, drawing from all of the ABC News resources, and broadcasts live across Australia, with no delayed broadcasting to accommodate Australian time zones. Schedules may change if there is breaking news. Live parliamentary coverage takes precedence over the station's regular schedule, but while this coverage takes place (whenever Parliament is in session), regular news programming continues online, via digital radio (DAB+) in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. and on the ABC Listen app.

ABC News also broadcasts Australian Football League matches on weekends in some states.

As of 2017, there were around 700 transmitters across Australia.
An integrator in measurement and control applications is an element whose output signal is the time integral of its input signal. It accumulates the input quantity over a defined time to produce a representative output.

Integration is an important part of many engineering and scientific applications. Mechanical integrators are the oldest type and are still used for metering water flow or electrical power. Electronic analogue integrators are the basis of analog computers and charge amplifiers. Integration can also be performed by algorithms in digital computers.

In signal processing circuits

See also Integrator at op amp applications and op amp integrator

An electronic integrator is a form of first-order low-pass filter, which can be performed in the continuous-time (analog) domain or approximated (simulated) in the discrete-time (digital) domain. An integrator will have a low pass filtering effect but when given an offset it will accumulate a value building it until it reaches a limit of the system or overflows.

A voltage integrator is an electronic device performing a time integration of an electric voltage, thus measuring the total volt-second product. A simple resistor–capacitor circuit acts as an integrator at high frequencies. An op amp integrator (e.g. Figure 1) works over all frequencies and provides gain (though limited by the op amp's gain–bandwidth product).

A current integrator is an electronic device performing a time integration of an electric current, thus measuring a total electric charge. A charge amplifier is an example of current integrator. A current integrator is also used to measure the electric charge on a Faraday cup in a residual gas analyzer to measure partial pressures of gasses in a vacuum. Another application of current integration is in ion beam deposition, where the measured charge directly corresponds to the number of ions deposited on a substrate, assuming the charge state of the ions is known. The two current-carrying electrical leads must to be connected to the ion source and the substrate, closing the electric circuit which in part is given by the ion beam.

Drawbacks of ideal op amp integrator 
 For DC input (f = 0), the capacitive reactance X is infinite. Because of this, the op amp gets effectively in an open loop configuration, which has infinite open-loop gain (for an ideal op amp, or simply very large for real op amps). Hence, any small input offset voltages are also amplified and appears at output as a large error. This is referred as false triggering and must be avoided.
Thus, an ideal integrator needs to be modified with additional components to reduce the effect of an error voltage in practice. This modified integrator is referred as practical integrator.

Practical op amp integrator (lossy integrator) 
Main description at: The gain of an integrator at low frequency can be limited to avoid the saturation problem, by shunting the feedback capacitor with a resistor Rf. The parallel combination of Rf and C behaves like a practical capacitor which dissipates power, unlike an ideal capacitor. For this reason this circuit is also called a lossy integrator. The resistor Rf limits the low frequency gain to  (generally with Rf=10*R1) and thus provides DC stabilization.

This practical integrator acts as a low pass filter with constant gain in its low frequency pass band. It only performs integration in high frequencies, but can't in low frequencies, so bandwidth for integrating is limited.

Applications 
Integrating circuits are most commonly used in analog-to-digital converters, ramp generators, and also in wave shaping applications.
 Op-amp integrating amplifiers are used to perform calculus operations in analog computers.
 A totalizer in the industrial instrumentation trade integrates a signal representing water flow, producing a signal representing the total quantity of water that has passed by the flow meter.

In software

 Integrators may also be software components.
 In some computational physics computer simulations, such as numerical weather prediction, molecular dynamics, flight simulators, reservoir simulation, noise barrier design, architectural acoustics, and electronic circuit simulation, an integrator is a numerical method for integrating trajectories from forces (and thereby accelerations) that are only calculated at discrete time steps.

Mechanical integrators

Mechanical integrators were key elements in the mechanical differential analyser, used to solve practical physical problems.  Mechanical integration mechanisms were also used in control systems such as regulating flows or temperature in industrial processes. Mechanisms such as the ball-and-disk integrator were used both for computation in differential analysers and as components of instruments such as naval gun directors, flow totalizers and others. A planimeter is a mechanical device used for calculating the definite integral of a curve given in graphical form, or more generally finding the area of a closed curve.  An integraph is used to plot the indefinite integral of a function given in graphical form.

The Damascus Affair of 1840 marks the real beginning of the diplomatic or international phase in the history of American Jews (though a reference to the services which Mordecai M. Noah rendered his country as consul at Tunis (1813–16) should not be omitted). The persecutions and tortures to which some of the most prominent Jews of Damascus had been subjected were reported to the Department of State at Washington, D.C. by the United States consul at Damascus. Immediate instructions, under date of 14 August 1840, were thereupon issued to John Gliddon, the United States consul at Alexandria, Egypt, by Secretary of State John Forsyth, in which he directed that all good offices and efforts be employed to display the active sympathy of the United States in the attempts that the governments of Europe were making to mitigate the horrors of these persecutions. Three days later David Porter, the United States minister to the Ottoman Empire, was instructed by Forsyth to do everything in his power at the Porte to alleviate the condition of the unfortunates. In both these communications the reasons for the intervention of the United States are based upon sentiments of justice and humanity, no American citizens being involved; in the communication to Minister Porter stress was laid upon the peculiar propriety and right of the intervention of the United States, because its political and civil institutions make no distinction in favor of individuals by reason of race or creed, but treat all with absolute equality.

Damascus Affair

Though it would appear that this action of the United States was taken without the solicitation of any Jews of the US, measures were already on foot to display the feeling of the Jews at this time. Public meetings were held in August and September 1840, in New York City, Philadelphia, and Richmond, participated in by both Christians and Jews, at which resolutions were passed asking the United States to intervene to procure justice for the accused and the mitigation of their hardships. Among the leaders who were instrumental in calling these meetings were Jacob Ezekiel of Richmond, J. B. Kurscheedt and Theodore J. Seixas of New York, and Isaac Leeser and John Moss of Philadelphia. Considerable correspondence passed between these leaders and the Department of State, in which the humanitarian attitude of the government and the nature of its intervention are fully disclosed.

Ten years later the Jews of the US were concerned in the diplomatic relations with Switzerland. Almost simultaneously the negotiations assumed two phases: (a) respecting the ratification of a treaty in which lurked the possibility that American citizens who were not Christians might be discriminated against, and (b) concerning the actual discrimination in Switzerland against American citizens, on the ground that they belonged to the Jewish faith.

Swiss disabilities

In November 1850, A. Dudley Mann, the American representative, negotiated a treaty with the Swiss Confederation, which was transmitted to the United States Senate on 13 February 1851, by President Millard Fillmore. At the same time the president sent a message in which he took exception to a part of the first article of the treaty, which specifically provided that Christians alone were to be entitled to the privileges guaranteed. An agitation against the ratification of the treaty was started by the Jews as soon as its existence was learned of, and Daniel Webster, then secretary of state, and Senator Henry Clay at once (February 1851) went on record as opposed to the objectionable clause of the treaty. The principal agents in stirring up the opposition were Isaac Leeser, David Einhorn, J. M. Cardozo of Charleston, South Carolina, and Capt. Jonas Phillips Levy of New York. A movement was set on foot in the US shortly thereafter (1852–53) to procure religious toleration abroad for American citizens generally; this was quite distinct from any movement started by the Jews, but greatly aided the latter. As a result of this combined opposition the Senate declined to ratify the treaty. Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan figured largely in the opposition to it. He corresponded with Rev. Isaac Leeser and Captain Levy respecting it, delivered several notable speeches in the Senate against it in 1854, and presented a petition on April 19, 1854, which had been signed by Jews of the United States at the instance of a committee of New York Jews, of which Alexander J. Kursheedt was chairman. As a result, the treaty was amended by the Senate, and in its amended form was ratified and proclaimed 9 November 1855. But the amendment, though less objectionable in phraseology, retained the same connotation and rendered it possible, under its terms, for the Swiss cantons to discriminate against Jews in the manner they had adopted in 1851. Though unsuccessful in preventing the ratification of the treaty, the agitation against it did not cease. Notwithstanding the treaty was proclaimed at the end of 1855, it would appear that this was not generally known until 1857. Attention was drawn to it by the fact that one A. H. Gootman, an American citizen and a Jew, had received notice in 1856 to leave La Chaux-de-Fonds, in Neuchâtel, where he had transacted business for five years. Public meetings of protest were held during 1857, in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Easton, Pa., Charleston, Baltimore, and elsewhere, and a vigorous opposition was voiced by Isaac M. Wise in his paper, "The Israelite", by David Einhorn in "Sinai", and by Isaac Leeser in "The Occident". A convention of Jews met in Baltimore in October, and a delegation appointed by this convention waited on President James Buchanan in the same month to protest against the treaty and request its abrogation; the president promised to take steps to accede to their request so far as lay in his power. Numerous memorials were also transmitted to the president and the Senate. That this agitation attracted general attention is manifested by the fact that the newspapers throughout the country expressed vigorous opinions against the treaty.

Though sporadic efforts to procure an alteration in the treaty and the establishment of the rights not only of American Jews but of the Jews of all nations in Switzerland continued to be made in the United States, the principal scene of negotiations shifted to the former country, and the principal actor was Theodore Fay, the American minister. Beginning in August 1853, when an American citizen, the same Gootman referred to above, received orders from the authorities of La Chaux-de-Fonds, canton of Neuchâtel, to leave that canton on the ground that he was a Jew, Fay, though at first disinclined to take any very energetic stand, finally became much interested in the subject of Swiss discrimination against Jews and kept up an active agitation until his recall in 1860. He succeeded in procuring permission for Gootman to remain, but only as an act of grace, not by right. The obstacle Fay had to attempt to overcome lay in the nature of the Swiss Confederation, which left to the cantons the regulation of the rights of domicil, the Federal Council having no control over the cantons in this respect. Fay was ably supported in his contentions by the secretaries of state Marcy and Lewis Cass, especially the latter. In the course of his negotiations Fay made an elaborate study of the Jewish question as it affected Switzerland, and in June 1859, transmitted what he called his "Israelite Note" to the Federal Council. This is an extensive treatise explaining the American contention with much force, and embodying besides a general defense of the Jews. It was translated into German and French, was offered for sale by the Federal Council, received much notice in the Swiss newspapers, and caused the restrictions against Jews to be abolished in several cantons. In 1860 the executive committee of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites, of which Myer S. Isaacs was secretary, took steps to continue the agitation in America. Henry I. Hart, the president of the above-mentioned board, took up the matter with Secretary Seward shortly after he assumed office in 1861, and the secretary issued specific instructions to the new minister to Switzerland, George G. Fogg, to be no less active in his endeavor to establish the rights of American Jews than was his predecessor. The restrictions in the cantons were gradually abolished, and full civil rights were finally guaranteed to all Jews by the new Swiss Constitution of 1874. It may be added, however, that the treaty of 1855 is still in force (1905; "Publ. Am. Jew. Hist. Soc." No. 11, pp. 7 et seq.).

Serbia and Palestine

In 1867 Myer S. Isaacs, on behalf of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites, endeavored unsuccessfully to have the government take some steps to alleviate the condition of the Jews in Serbia. In 1882 Gen. Lew Wallace, United States minister to the Ottoman Empire, moved by the hardships suffered by Russian refugees whom he found starving in the streets of Constantinople, called at the Foreign Office and received a communication from the minister of foreign affairs in which the statement was made that Jews would be made welcome anywhere in the Ottoman Empire, except in Ottoman Palestine. In 1884 he took vigorous action against the threatened expulsion from Jerusalem of sundry naturalized American Jews. In 1887 and 1888 attempts were made by the Ottoman government to limit the sojourn of American Jews in Jerusalem to one month—later extended to three months. This was earnestly opposed by the American minister, Oscar S. Straus, ably supported by Secretary Bayard, who contended that the United States, by reason of its Constitution, could not recognize any distinction between American citizens in respect to their religion. By his exertions Straus successfully halted any steps to expel American citizens who happened to be Jews ("U.S. For. Rel." 1887, 1888, 1889). Secretaries Blaine, Gresham, and Hay repeatedly took a similar stand, and it would appear that rights of American citizens who are Jews have been carefully guarded in the Ottoman Empire ("U.S. For. Rel." 1894, 1898, 1901).

Morocco

In 1863 atrocities perpetrated upon the Jews of Morocco led the Board of Delegates to ask the intervention of the United States. Secretary Seward instructed the United States consul at Tangier to use his good offices to further the mission of Sir Moses Montefiore, basing his act on the ground of common humanity. For two years the consul exerted himself to carry out his instructions and met with some slight success. In 1878 the Board of Delegates renewed its endeavors to have the government use its good offices in Morocco, and the consul at Tangier, F. A. Matthews, took earnest steps to alleviate the condition of the Jews whenever the opportunity arose during this and succeeding years. Adolph Sanger, on behalf of the Board of Delegates, in 1880 sent out an agent, L. A. Cohen, to Morocco to report on conditions there. In March 1881, the United States minister at Madrid, Lucius Fairchild, proceeded to Morocco to investigate the condition of the Jews. He made a sympathetic and valuable report to the secretary of state, Blaine, in which he displayed an acute interest in the unfortunate conditions in that country, and did his utmost to alleviate them.

Romanian disabilities

Romanian conditions, which have so vitally interested the United States, first had attention drawn to them by the Board of Delegates in June 1867, when the good offices of the United States in behalf of the persecuted Jews of Romania were requested. In 1870 B. F. Peixotto of New York was appointed consul-general to Romania, and during the six years that he held office he exerted himself to bring about an improvement in the condition of the Jews. In 1878 John A. Kasson, minister of the United States to Austria, in a despatch to the Department of State proposed as a condition preliminary to the recognition of Romanian independence that the United States join with the European powers in exacting from Romania, at the Congress of Berlin, the recognition of the equal civil, commercial, and religious rights of all classes of her population, as also equal rights and protection under the treaty and under Romanian laws, irrespective of race or religious belief. In opening negotiations with Romania in the following year, the recognition by that country of the rights of sojourn and trade of all classes of Americans irrespective of race or creed was strongly emphasized, as it was by Kasson about the same time with respect to Serbia. The continued persecutions of the Jews of Romania, her violations of the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin, and the greatly increased proportions which the Romanian emigration to the United States assumed in consequence, as also the failure to conclude a naturalization convention between the two countries, because Romania would not recognize the rights of American citizens who were Jews, moved Secretary of State John Hay to address on 11 August 1902, identical instructions to the representatives of the United States in Russia, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Turkey upon the subject of Romania's attitude. In this note he drew attention to the consequences to the United States of the continued persecutions in Romania—namely, the unnatural increase of immigration from that country—and upon this based his right to remonstrate to the signatories to the Treaty of Berlin against the acts of the Romanian government. Further, he sustained the right of the United States to ask the above-mentioned powers to intervene upon the strongest grounds of humanity. Acting upon the forcible instructions, the representatives of the United States presented this note to the government to which each was accredited. But beyond the abolition of the Oath More Judaico (1904) and some slight diminution of the harshness of the persecution, little has been accomplished, and Romania continues (1905) almost unrestrictedly to violate the treaty which established her as an independent nation. In 1905 Congress made provision for an American legation at Bucharest.

Russian passports

The diplomatic correspondence between Russia and the United States involving Jews is of considerable bulk. It relates for the most part to the failure of Russia to recognize the validity of American passports where Jews are involved, which is the principal cause of difference between the United States and Russia. Russia has constantly violated the provisions of her treaty of 1832 with the United States, which gives to the citizens of the two countries unrestricted rights of sojourn, travel, and protection. Until the persecutions in Russia assumed acute form, beginning with 1880, the correspondence between the two countries was not of importance, though occasional earlier instances of discrimination by Russia against American citizens who were Jews had been vigorously protested against by the United States authorities. For the past twenty-five years the record is one of unceasing effort on the part of the United States to establish the rights of American citizens who are Jews, and of continued declination of Russia to live up to her treaty stipulations. The threatened expulsion from St. Petersburg of an American citizen named Pinkos, in 1880, was the occasion for the presentation of energetic notes of remonstrance by John W. Foster, the American minister to Russia. He acted not alone of his own responsibility, but was the recipient of specific instructions from the secretary of state, William M. Evarts. In the course of one of Evarts' letters of instruction the attitude assumed by the United States was clearly set forth in the following terms: "In the view of this government the religion professed by one of its citizens has no relation to that citizen's right to the protection of the United States" ("Am. Jewish Year Book," 1904-5, p. 287). The first protests of Foster and Evarts, inasmuch as they brought forth no satisfactory replies, were succeeded by others of the same tenor, in one of which Evarts stated "that we ask treaty treatment for our aggrieved citizens, not because they are Jews, but because they are Americans" (ib. p. 290). All the answers of the Russian Foreign Office are based on the claim that the proscriptive laws against the Jews were in existence prior to the treaty of 1832, that they, therefore, must be assumed under the treaty, and, furthermore, that the Jewish question in Russia was complicated by economic and other difficulties. These views were answered in the able despatch of James Blaine, secretary of state, of July 29, 1881. This despatch covers in considerable detail the whole of the American contention, and is so forcibly put that subsequent consideration of the same subject by the Department of State has been unable to add much to it ("For. Rel. U.S." 1881, p. 1030). As continued remonstrances during subsequent years led to no results, in 1893 the Department of State took the stand that it could not acquiesce in the action of Russian consuls in asking the religion of American citizens desiring to travel in Russia before granting a visé to their passports, and refusing Jews. The government regarded this as the "assumption of a religious inquisitorial function within our own borders, by a foreign agency, in a manner... repugnant to the national sense." In 1895 this view was forcibly presented to the Russian government by the American minister, Clifton R. Breckenridge, and in July of that year the Department of State took the attitude that a "continuance in such a course, after our views have been clearly but considerately made known, may trench upon the just limits of consideration" (ib. pp. 295, 297). But in spite of the presentation of the American contention in every possible light and with all possible emphasis, Russia stubbornly refuses to live up to her treaty obligations.

In April 1902, at the instance of Henry M. Goldfogle, a member of Congress from New York, the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling upon the secretary of state to inform the House "whether American citizens of the Jewish religious faith holding passports issued by this government are barred or excluded from entering the territory of the Empire of Russia," and what action concerning the matter had been taken by the government. A few days later Secretary Hay replied, stating in brief what efforts had been made by the United States for the protection of American citizens in Russia, and added that though "begun many years ago... [they] have not been attended with encouraging success" (ib. pp. 301, 302).

In January 1904, Goldfogle introduced another resolution, requesting the president to resume negotiations with Russia looking to the recognition of the validity of American passports irrespective of the religion of the holder. This resolution gave rise to notable addresses on the part of a number of members of the House, and was passed, in substance, in April of that year (ib. pp. 304, 305). In consequence of this resolution the question of American passports was taken up anew by the Department of State during the summer of 1904. The Russian reply made at that time was to the effect that a commission had been created in 1903 to consider the revision of the passport regulations, and that the desires of the United States would be brought to the attention of that commission. In his annual message, December 1904, President Roosevelt wrote vigorously against the Russian attitude, characterizing it as "unjust and irritating toward us." In February 1905, a committee of members of the House of Representatives was formed, with Wachter of Maryland as chairman, to urge further action by the Department of State. As yet nothing significant has been accomplished.

Kishinef petition

The massacres at Kishinef in April 1903, aroused indignation throughout the United States. Though in response to a cable of inquiry sent by Secretary John Hay to Ambassador Robert S. McCormick at St. Petersburg, asking if relief could be sent to the sufferers, the ambassador stated that he was informed officially that there was no distress or want in south-western Russia, nevertheless mass-meetings were held in almost every city of importance, and the comments in the newspapers portrayed the feelings of horror of the American people. A practical turn was given by the collection of considerable sums to alleviate the misery of the unfortunates. In the hope that if the attention of the czar were directly brought to the plight of the Jews in his dominions their condition might be alleviated, the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith took measures to prepare a petition for transmittal to him. On June 15, 1903, a committee of the order waited upon Secretary Hay and President Theodore Roosevelt, and presented a tentative draft of the petition. This having met with their approval, it was then circulated throughout the United States, and over 12,500 signatures of Christians and Jews in all walks of life were appended to it. On July 15 the American representative at St. Petersburg was instructed to ask an audience of the minister of foreign affairs in order to find out whether the petition, which was given in full in the despatch, would be received by the minister to be put before the czar. The minister declined to receive it, and the bound copy with the signatures was placed by Secretary Hay in the archives of the Department of State in October 1903. Though the petition did not reach its destination, its words attained worldwide publicity, and its object was in a measure accomplished in this way (Adler, "Voice of America on Kishineff," 1904).

Throughout the history of the United States the government has insisted with great force upon the equal treatment of all American citizens in foreign countries, irrespective of race or creed. Further, it never has failed to intercede with foreign governments on humanitarian grounds, whenever the opportunity arose, in behalf of Jews who were being persecuted or of those to whom life was rendered precarious by inhuman proscriptive laws. A considerable number of Jews have held diplomatic posts, among the more prominent being Mordecai M. Noah, consul to Tunis, 1813–16; Edwin de Leon, consul-general to Egypt, 1854; August Belmont, secretary of legation at The Hague, 1853–55, and minister resident, 1855–58; Oscar S. Straus, minister to Turkey, 1887–89, 1897–1900; Solomon Hirsch, minister to Turkey, 1889–92; B. F. Peixotto, consul to Bucharest, 1870–76; Simon Wolf, consul-general to Egypt, 1881; Max Judd, consul-general to Vienna, 1893–97; and Lewis Einstein, third secretary of embassy at Paris, 1903, and London, 1905.
In geometry, the metabidiminished icosahedron is one of the Johnson solids. The name refers to one way of constructing it, by removing two pentagonal pyramids from a regular icosahedron, replacing two sets of five triangular faces of the icosahedron with two adjacent pentagonal faces. If two pentagonal pyramids are removed to form nonadjacent pentagonal faces, the result is instead the pentagonal antiprism.
Non incautus futuri is a motto meaning "Not Unmindful of the Future".

The motto is used on the crest of Washington and Lee University, located in Lexington, Virginia.  It is also the motto of the Lee family, along with the name of the Futuri Society at Stratford Hall Plantation in Stratford, Virginia. The phase Ne incautus futuri meaning "Be Not Unmindful of the Future" was adopted as the motto of Hagerstown Business College, located in Hagerstown, Maryland in 1938. 

The motto was officially adopted by Leesburg, Virginia in 1998.

The quote on the Lee family crest was "Ne incautus futuri", which holds the same translation.
Tasseography (also known as tasseomancy, tassology, or tasseology) is a divination or fortune-telling method that interprets patterns in tea leaves, coffee grounds, or wine sediments.

The terms derive from the French word tasse (cup), which in turn derives from the  Arabic loan-word into French tassa, and the respective Greek suffixes -graph (writing), -mancy (divination), and -logy (study of).

History

Tasseomancy followed the trade routes of tea and coffee and was practiced by both Baltic and Slavic nations. It is closely related to the Romani people, whose nomadic lifestyle contributed to the spread of the practice, though its exact origins are unknown. Throughout its history, different regions have practiced it with slight variations which indicates that this form of divination was an oral tradition. It is not considered a closed cultural practice, but oftentimes it is traditional to ask permission from a Romani elder as a sign of respect. 

Western tasseography can be linked to medieval European fortune tellers who developed their readings from splatters of wax, lead, and other molten substances, which are related to many similar and established rituals in Asia such as pagtatawas.

According to different sources, coffee fortune-telling first appeared in the Ottoman Palaces in the 1500s. Arabic coffee is a coffee culture that later spread from Yemen to the rest of the Middle East, Ottoman Empire and the Balkans, and then to many parts of the world. Coffee started somewhere in the Arab world and West Asia. When they were bored, the concubines in the Ottoman harem used to drink coffee and tell each other fortunes to chat and gossip.

Method of tea-leaf reading

The Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology, Fifth Edition, Vol. 2, edited by J. Gordon Melton, notes:

Melton's described methods of pouring away the tea and shaking the cup are rarely seen; most readers ask the querent to drink the tea off, then swirl the cup.

Regarding interpretation of leaves, according to James Randi, "Leaves on the bottom, we're told, indicate the distant future, those on the rim the immediate future. Tea leaf stems represent persons. Fat stems are fat people, for example."

Fortune telling tea cups

Although many people prefer a simple white cup for tea leaf reading, there are also traditions concerning the positional placement of the leaves in the cup, and some find it easier to work with marked cups. Beginning in the late 19th century and continuing to the present, English and American potteries have produced specially decorated cup and saucer sets for the use of tea-leaf readers. Many of these designs are patented and come with instructions explaining their mode of use. Some of the most common were those that were given away with purchases of bulk tea.

Coffee reading

Coffee reading is traditionally practiced using Arabic or Turkish coffee, as they produce a very thick sediment. The coffee in the cup is consumed, and the sediment is left to settle.

There are several variations of coffee reading. They commonly require for the cup to be covered with the saucer and turned upside-down. In the Turkish tradition, coffee-readers often interpret the cup as being divided into horizontal halves: symbols appearing on the bottom half are interpreted as messages regarding the past, and symbols on the top half are messages regarding the future. The cup may also be interpreted in vertical halves to determine "yes" or "no" answers as well as the overall outcome of the events represented by symbols. For example, some fortune tellers may "read" symbols in the "left" half as "negative" events or outcomes, while symbols in the "right" half are "read" as "positive". Other readers may adhere to the belief that the cup is capable of revealing insights about the past, but it cannot predict events beyond forty days into the future. The saucer may also be incorporated into the reading. As with the cup, different variations exist for what the saucer represents, including whether the saucer sticking to the cup indicates a "positive" or "negative" outcome.

Symbols
When a cup of tea or coffee has been drunk, a sediment often remains.

This sediment can be known to form patterns or symbols within it, leaving a perfect canvas for interpretation. There are many possibilities of images appearing in a cup. Images formed in a cup are created and uniquely seen by the reader, so it is often said that the only limitation for cup reading is the imagination of the reader themselves.

Symbols can be many things, including physical objects and abstract concepts.  Often, the reader will interpret symbols together for a prediction as well as acknowledging their individual meanings.

Symbol interpretation can be drawn from history, statistics, pop culture references, and often nature or how we interact with the world. There are also many classic image interpretations that were developed in Great Britain in the late 1800s as tasseomancy gained popularity as a parlour game.

Leontodon is a genus of plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae, commonly known as hawkbits.

Their English name derives from the mediaeval belief that hawks ate the plant to improve their eyesight. Although originally only native to Eurasia and North Africa, some species have since become established in other countries, including the United States and New Zealand.

Recent research has shown that the genus Leontodon in the traditional delimitation is polyphyletic. Therefore, the former Leontodon subgenus Oporinia was raised to generic level. According to the nomenclatural rules the name Scorzoneroides has priority at generic level and therefore, the members of Leontodon subgenus Oporinia were transferred to the re-erected genus Scorzoneroides.

Ecology
Seeds of Leontodon species are an important food source for certain bird species.

Uses
In Crete, the species Leontodon tuberosus which is called ,  or  has its roots eaten raw and its leaves eaten steamed.

Secondary metabolites 
The genus Leontodon s.str. (i.e. excluding the members of the resurrected genus Scorzoneroides) is a rich source of hypocretenolides, unique guaiane type sesquiterpene lactones with a 12,5-lactone ring instead of the usual 12,6 lactone ring.

Phenolics found in Leontodon include luteolin type flavonoids and caffeoyl quinic acid derivatives such as chlorogenic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid. Moreover, Leontodon species contain the caffeoyl tartaric acid derivatives caffeoyl tartaric acid and cichoric acid.

Nándor János Dáni (born 2 July 1871 in Budapest, Austria-Hungary; died 31 December 1949 in Budapest, Hungary) was a Hungarian athlete. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Dáni competed in the 800 metres, taking second place in his preliminary heat to advance to the final.  There, he again finished behind Edwin Flack of Australia, the same runner who had beaten him in the first round.  Dáni's time in the final was 2:11.8, less than a second behind Flack's 2:11.0 time.
Glendon James Rusch (born November 7, 1974) is a left-handed former Major League Baseball pitcher. He played for the Kansas City Royals, New York Mets, Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies.

Early life
Rusch played baseball at Shorecrest High School in Seattle, Washington. As a senior, he had a 0.79 earned run average and struck out 134 batters while walking 15. He committed to play college baseball for the Washington Huskies. Rusch was selected out of high school by the Kansas City Royals in the 17th round of the 1993 MLB draft and chose to sign.

Baseball career
Rusch made his major league debut in 1997. Near the end of the 1999 season, he was traded to the New York Mets, and in 2002 he was traded along with Lenny Harris to the Milwaukee Brewers for four players, including Jeromy Burnitz in a three-team deal that also involved the Colorado Rockies.

In 2002, Rusch tied for the National League in losses with 16. In 2004, he signed with the Chicago Cubs and had arguably his finest year as he recorded a career-low 3.47 ERA and 1.23 WHIP and had a 6–2 record, the first winning record of his career.

In September of , Rusch was diagnosed with a life-threatening blood clot in his lung and missed the rest of the 2006 season. On January 25, 2007, the Cubs released the left-hander. He had one year left on his contract.

On October 31, 2007, Rusch announced that he was officially a free agent and would attempt a comeback for the  season. He threw a bullpen session for interested teams on November 2 and on December 14, signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. On March 26, 2008, the Padres purchased his contract and added him to the major league roster. On May 15, Rusch turned down an assignment to Triple-A, and became a free agent.

On May 16, 2008, he signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. On May 31, the Rockies purchased his contract and added him to the active roster.

On January 14, 2009, Rusch signed a one-year, $750,000 minor-league deal. He made the team out of spring training.  On May 15, Rusch was designated for assignment.

Coaching career

On January, 2015, Rusch was named pitching coach for the San Diego Padres Class A – Advanced team Lake Elsinore Storm, of the California League.
The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World is a book by Esquire editor A. J. Jacobs, published in 2004.

It recounts his experience of reading the entire Encyclopædia Britannica; all 32 volumes of the 2002 edition, extending to  over 33,000 pages with some 44 million words. He set out on this endeavour to become the "smartest person in the world". The book is organized alphabetically in encyclopedia format and recounts both interesting facts from the encyclopedia and the author's experiences.

It was a New York Times Best Seller.

Reviews 
The satirist P.J. O'Rourke said of it: "The Know-It-All is a terrific book. It's a lot shorter than the encyclopedia, and funnier, and you'll remember more of it. Plus, if it falls off the shelf onto your head, you'll live."

By contrast, Joe Queenan in The New York Times Book Review contended that much of which Jacobs reported as remarkable discoveries, e.g. the tale of Heloise and Abelard and the assassination of Marat by a woman, were already common knowledge among educated people. Jacobs responded that "the ridiculously hyperbolic subtitle might have been a tip-off" of the book's ironic tone.

Similar feats 
A.J. Jacobs was not the first to read the entire Britannica.  The earliest recorded example was Fath Ali, who upon becoming the Shah of Persia in 1797, was given a gift of the 3rd edition of the Britannica.  After reading all of its 18 volumes, the Shah extended his royal title to include "Most Formidable Lord and Master of the Encyclopædia Britannica".  Roughly a century later, Amos Urban Shirk, an American businessman, read the entire 23-volume 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica over a period of four years. He then went on to read the entire 14th edition, spending on average three hours per night.

Elon Musk read the Encyclopædia Britannica twice.

Bill Gates read the entire World Book Encyclopedia in his youth.

Preston James Richard Wilson (born July 19, 1974) is an American former professional baseball center fielder. He played all or parts of ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1998 to 2007 for the New York Mets, Florida Marlins, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals. He is both the nephew and stepson of former New York Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson. (Mookie married Wilson's mother after his brother fathered Wilson.)

Professional career

New York Mets
At age 17, Wilson was drafted by the Mets out of Bamberg-Ehrhardt High School in the first round of the 1992 MLB draft. The Baseball America 1992 High School Player of the Year, Wilson was ranked among the top 100 prospects in baseball by the magazine four times between 1993 and 1998. He was known to be an aggressive hitter, according to scouts and media sources, based on his propensity to swing at the first pitch and his high strikeout rates.

After spending five seasons below Triple A and a season in 1998 in the Australian Baseball League with the Hunter Eagles, Wilson finally reached the majors in May 1998. Two weeks after joining the Mets, he was traded to the Florida Marlins with two other minor leaguers for Mike Piazza. He returned to the minor leagues for most of the season.

Florida Marlins
In 1999, Wilson was the Marlins' regular center fielder. Wilson led the team in home runs and runs batted in as a rookie, and he finished second in the NL Rookie of the Year balloting to Cincinnati Reds reliever Scott Williamson.

The following season, Wilson joined the 30–30 club, slugging 31 home runs and stealing 36 bases. He added 121 RBIs, good for eighth in the National League. In 2000, he led the major leagues in power-speed number (33.3). Wilson also lived up to his reputation as a free swinger, nearly setting a new record for most strikeouts in a season. His total of 187 fell two shy of Bobby Bonds' record at the time.

Wilson hit 23 home runs in each of the following two seasons, though his overall production dipped, partially due to missed games.

Colorado Rockies
After the 2002 season, Wilson was involved in a six-player deal which sent him and three other players to the Colorado Rockies for Juan Pierre and Mike Hampton. Wilson rebounded in 2003, when he set career highs with a .282 batting average, 43 doubles, and 36 home runs. He also led the National League with 141 runs batted in and was named to his first All-Star team.

Bothered by a knee injury in 2004, Wilson was limited to 58 games.

Washington Nationals
Wilson was acquired by the Washington Nationals in July 2005 for pitcher Zach Day and outfielder J. J. Davis. He led the team in homers and RBIs during the second half of the season, finishing with 25 and 90 respectively.

Houston Astros
In the 2005 offseason, Wilson signed a one-year deal worth $4 million with the Houston Astros, with a team option of three additional years at $24 million and a buyout of $500,000. Previously a center fielder, Wilson shifted to left since Willy Taveras, the previous season's Rookie of the Year runner-up, was already occupying the position.
On April 17, 2006, Wilson set an Astros record by striking out five times in a single game. This tied the MLB record. Despite early struggles, Wilson was batting .284 with 46 RBIs at the 2006 All-Star Break, with the potential for another 100+ RBI season. However, his power numbers were well below his previous years.

St. Louis Cardinals
The St. Louis Cardinals signed Wilson on August 18, 2006. The Cardinals took another chance on a discarded veteran since veteran center fielder Jim Edmonds was out with post concussion syndrome. Wilson was designated for assignment by Houston on Saturday, August 12, before ultimately being given his release. He joined his new team six days later and was immediately inserted into the starting lineup. Wilson batted sixth and played right field, with Juan Encarnación moving to center field. He made an instant impact for the Cardinals, hitting a home run in an 11–3 rout of the Chicago Cubs on the 18th. The Cardinals went on to become World Champions, giving Wilson a World Series ring, as his stepfather Mookie had in 1986.

The Cardinals re-signed Wilson for 2007, but he suffered a knee injury in early May and missed the rest of the 2007 season. After the end of the 2007 season Wilson was released. Wilson generated little interest during spring training 2008, leaving him a free agent.

On February 14, 2009, Wilson announced his retirement from Major League Baseball.

Long Island Ducks 
On March 21, 2009, Preston was signed by the Long Island Ducks. He played under another former New York Mets player in Gary Carter, who was the manager of the Ducks. Wilson played in 48 games for the Ducks, hitting .304 with 7 home runs, 37 RBI, a .344 on-base percentage, and a .474 slugging percentage. He did not return to the Ducks for the 2010 season, and was considering a comeback to the major leagues, but never played professionally again.

After baseball
Wilson spent several years as an analyst for Fox Sports Florida's coverage of the Miami Marlins alongside former Marlins players Jeff Conine and Carl Pavano. In 2016, Wilson, along with Eduardo Perez and Al Leiter, served as an analyst with play-by-play man Rich Waltz. This analyst rotation come about after the Marlins fired longtime analyst Tommy Hutton after the 2015 season. Also in 2016, when his Marlins schedule did not conflict, Wilson served as an analyst for MLB Network. Additionally, Wilson hosted "Marlins Clubhouse", a magazine-style TV show for Fox Sports Florida.

Starting in the 2018 season, Wilson worked for the AT&T Sports Network covering the Houston Astros as a field reporter.

The Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) Class 200 diesel locomotives were built for shunting duties. 169 of these small locomotives, numbered 201–369, were built by Werkspoor from 1934–1951. They were known as "Sik" (Sik in singular, goats) by rail enthusiasts and "locomotor" by railway staff. Fifteen of these locomotives were rebuilt with a retractable crane. The few locomotives in active service were retired in 2008 after new Dutch personnel safety regulations prevented NS from using them any longer. Most were no longer active at that time.

This locomotive was mainly operated as a shunter, although they were active on a few remote branch lines.

Technique 
The design and operation was based on the simplest of things, which in effect made them very reliable. The locomotive was operated by design from the outside (side of engine) and wasn't equipped with a dead man device to stop the locomotive automatically in case of incapacity of the operator. There were two manual brakes: a handle and a foot brake. As the handle could be moved by in-train forces while dead-heading it was required to be fixed by a nut and bolt. Upon taking the locomotive into service again, it was necessary to loosen the nut and bolt. In some cases, this was forgotten, and the result was that the operator couldn't brake; many Siks have suffered collision damage due to this.

A special design was implemented for coolant; the fuel tank with diesel was also the coolant for the engine. The theory was that the coolant would never be exhausted while the locomotive is in use.

The locomotive didn't have an air pressure system. To obtain a whistle a device was put on top of the exhaust to use the flow of exhaust gases as the whistle air. This resulted in a very characteristic whistle sound (to imitate the sound, whistle a high-pitched tone while making a rolling R sound).

Preservation 
Of all locomotives of the NS 200 series, many have been preserved in either a running condition at heritage railway lines, for spare parts, or as a static object. Out of the 169 locomotives build, 80 were lost during the 2nd World War or scrapped.

There is a well-known and accurate H0 scale model offered in various liveries by Roco.

Before becoming Patriarch, Mark wrote the entries of the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria that covers the years between 1131 and 1167.

At the start of Mark's papacy, the bishops of Upper Egypt wrote to Mark about the previously excommunicated Mark Ibn Kunbar. The Pope met Kunbar in person brought him to repentance. Afterwards, Kunbar continued to preach against the practice of private confession of sins. In 1173, Pope Mark called a synod of sixty bishops at The Hanging Church, which unanimously excommunicated Kunbar from the Coptic church for the second time.

Palm Valley, within the Finke Gorge National Park, is an east-west running valley in the Krichauff Range 123 km (138 km by road) southwest of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Australia. Palm Valley and the surrounding area is the only place in Central Australia where Red Cabbage Palms (Livistona mariae) survive. The nearest related species is 850 kilometres away in Katherine NT. The surrounding region is largely dry Central Ranges xeric scrub.

The average rainfall for Palm Valley is only 200 mm per year. Although the gorge usually appears dry, there are some small pockets of semi-permanent spring-fed pools that allow the unique flora in this region to survive. During significant rainfall in the region, expanses of water can be witnessed flowing through the valley gorge. During such events, a variety of aquatic life such as desert fish, shield shrimps (Triops australiensis), tadpoles and frogs can flourish.

Origins of the palms

It had been assumed that the cabbage palms were remnants of a prehistoric time when the climate supported tropical rainforest in what is now the arid inland of Australia. Genetic analysis published in 2012 determined that Livistona mariae at Palm Valley is actually the same species as Livistona rigida from samples collected near Katherine and Mount Isa, both around  away. The research by Professor David Bowman and colleagues at the University of Tasmania concluded that the populations separated only about 15,000 years ago. Aboriginal legend recorded in 1894 by Carl Strehlow describes "gods from the north" bringing the seeds to Palm Valley.

Getting there
In early 1928, Herbert Joseph Larkin led an exploratory aerial expedition exploring the possibility of developing the Palm Valley into a resort. However, the exploration led to naught.

The track to Palm Valley is still only accessible with a four-wheel drive vehicle. It departs from the town of Hermannsburg and travels south, following the usually dry bed of the Finke River. Palm Creek flows into the Finke River from the west about 15 km (by track) south of Hermannsburg. The track follows the creek to Palm Valley about 5 km west of the Finke River.

Gas field
The Palm Valley gas field is an onshore source of natural gas north of the valley itself. The gas field is part of the Amadeus Basin and supplies gas to Alice Springs and beyond via the Amadeus Gas Pipeline.
The Uda is a river in Khabarovsk Krai, in the Russian Far East. It is  long, and has a drainage basin of .

Geography
The Uda flows into the Sea of Okhotsk near the small town Chumikan. It rises south of the eastern Stanovoy Mountains and flows roughly eastwards. It borders the northern side of the Dzhagdy Range. In its lower course it flows close to the northwestern side of the Taikan Range into the Uda Gulf of the Sea of Okhotsk near the Shantar Islands. Lake Bokon is located in the lower basin of the river.

Tributaries
Its main tributaries are the  long Shevly, the  long Gerbikan and the  long Galam from the right, and the  long Chogar, the  long Dzhana, the  long Maya and the  long Udykhyn from the left.

History
From the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) to the Treaty of Aigun (1858) its lower course was officially part of the border between Russia and China, although the border was not clearly marked and the area rarely visited. Some of Ivan Moskvitin's men reached the Uda in 1640. The local Lamuts told them of the rivers Zeya and the Amur but would not guide them inland. In 1684 some Cossacks fled from the Manchus on the Zeya, reached Udsk, and went up the Maya to Yakutsk.

Udsk Ostrog (fort) was founded in 1679,  or 1659  on the left bank of the river  upstream. There were suggestions to move Okhotsk south to Udsk but this was rejected because of the poor harbor and the proximity of the Chinese border. There were generally about 10 peasant families around the fort trying to produce grain and a few thin cattle, but results were poor.  Sometimes seed corn had to be imported. A pood of rye flour that cost half a ruble at Irkutsk cost 8 to 10 rubles at Udsk. The population was 30 in 1690, 200 in 1800 and 164 in 1865.

Yakutsk-Udsk Track: This was an ill-defined route used to supply Udsk from Yakutsk. It was open from April to October but there was some winter travel. Its length was estimated at .  It crossed the Amga River at Amginsk, the Aldan River at Kompaneisk and the Uchur River at Uchur Crossing. Pack horses were usually left at Udsk as food for sled dogs or people while the Yakut drivers returned to Yakutsk on foot or skis. In 1750 all the pack horses perished in deep snow resulting in starvation. In 1788 more than 100 horses drowned during the spring snowmelt.

Folklore
In an earlier time, Kabunian–the supreme deity of the Kalinga–left a drop of water upon an ancient tree he passed on one of his travels. This drop trickled down and with a great force akin to magnetism, attracted nearby brooks and rivulets to form what is now called the Pasil River.
The Sioux City Musketeers are a junior ice hockey team playing in the Western Conference of the United States Hockey League (USHL). The Musketeers' home ice is Tyson Events Center. The team was founded in 1972, and has won three Anderson Cups as the regular season champion, and four Clark Cups as the playoffs champion of the USHL.

History
Dave Siciliano served as head coach and general manager of the Musketeers from 2000 to 2008. Sioux City radio station KOOL 99.5 broadcast The Dave Siciliano Show on Mondays during the season, which included interviews with the coach and the team's players. He promised that his team would be in better physical condition and to outwork their opponents.

In the 2001–02 season playoffs, the Musketeers defeated the Sioux Falls Stampede in three consecutive games in the first round, defeated the Green Bay Gamblers in four games in the second round, then defeated the Omaha Lancers three games to two in the playoffs finals to win the Clark Cup. At the start of the season, Siciliano had not expected to reach the finals nor win the cup, but credited the team for being tight-knit and "just great quality kids" who handled adversity. During the fifth game of the finals, the Musketeers trailed by a 3–1 score in the third period, then tied up the game in the final six minutes and won in overtime. In a 2008 interview, Siciliano recalled that the Clark Cup victory in 2002 was his fondest memory with the team.

In the 2004–05 season playoffs, the Musketeers won the first round by three games to one versus the Lincoln Stars, and won the second round by three games to one versus the Tri-City Storm. The Cedar Rapids RoughRiders won the Clark Cup in the fifth and deciding game by a 4–1 score. Siciliano credited his team for not quitting despite the strong play of opposing goaltender Alex Stalock.

When Siciliano resigned in 2008, he had the second most career victories for a coach in the USHL, and had the most wins for a Musketeers coach with 272 victories. He stated that he was proud of designing the team's circular dressing room at the Gateway Arena so that one could "look your teammates directly in the eye"; and was credited by the Sioux City Journal for having "etched a distinct signature on Musketeer ice success for eight seasons".

In August 2014, the Musketeers captured a Bronze Medal as the USHL representative at the Junior Club World Cup in Ufa, Russia. 2014–15 team captain Neal Pionk was named the tournament's best defenseman, while Adam Johnson led the tournament in scoring, with 9 points in 5 games. Both were named to the All-Tournament team. Pionk went on to win the 2014–15 USHL Defenseman of the Year. Both Pionk and Johnson were named to the 2014–15 All-USHL First Team. Ryan Zuhlsdorf was named to the USHL All-Rookie First Team, while Bobo Carpenter earned All-Rookie Second Team honors.

The Lilleküla Stadium (known as A. Le Coq Arena for sponsorship reasons) is a football stadium in Tallinn, Estonia. It is the home ground of football clubs Flora and Levadia, and the Estonia national football team. With a capacity of 14,336, it is the largest football stadium in Estonia.

Lilleküla Stadium was the venue for the 2018 UEFA Super Cup and the 2012 UEFA European U19 Championship.

History

In July 1998, FC Flora football club submitted a planning application to Tallinn City Council, requesting permission to build a new stadium on wasteland between railway lines in Kitseküla, close to the border with neighbouring Lilleküla. Receiving the council's approval, Flora signed a 99-year lease on the estate and construction began in October 2000. The stadium was designed by Haldo Oravas.

The stadium was officially opened 2 June 2001, with a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification match between Estonia and the Netherlands. The match saw Estonia's Andres Oper become the first player to score at the new stadium when he scored in the 65th minute, with the full-time result being a 4–2 victory for the Netherlands.

In January 2002, A. Le Coq bought naming rights for the stadium and Lilleküla Stadium.

During the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, the stadium hosted six out of 15 tournament matches, including the final, which saw Spain defeat Greece 1–0.

In 2012, Flora completed the transfer ownership of the Lilleküla Football Complex, including Lilleküla Stadium, to the Estonian Football Association.

In September 2016, it was announced that the stadium would host the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. In preparation for the match, the stadium's capacity was increased from 10,000 to 15,000. The 2018 UEFA Super Cup match between the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League winners Real Madrid and the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League winners Atlético Madrid was held on 15 August 2018, with Atlético Madrid winning 4–2 in extra time.

Lilleküla Football Complex
Lilleküla Stadium is part of the Lilleküla Football Complex, which also includes two grass surface pitches, two artificial turf pitches of which one is the 1,198-seat Sportland Arena, and an indoor football hall named EJL Jalgpallihall.

Music

Aside from football and other sporting events, several concerts have been held at Lilleküla Stadium. Lenny Kravitz performed in 2005 and Aerosmith in 2007.

The method of levels (MOL) is a cognitive approach to psychotherapy (or an approach to cognitive behavioral therapy) based on perceptual control theory (PCT).  Using MOL, the therapist aims to help the patient shift his or her awareness to higher levels of perception in order to resolve conflicts and allow reorganization to take place.

Background
Psychotherapy has generally focused on pathology, although there have been exceptions such as Carl Rogers' emphasis on the actualizing tendency. PCT contributes a useful perspective on psychological disorders by providing a model of satisfactory psychological functioning as successful control. Dysfunction then is understood as disruption of successful control, and distress as the experience that results from a person's inability to control important experiences. No attempt is made to treat the symptoms of distress as though they were in themselves the problem. The PCT perspective is that restoring the ability to control eliminates the source of distress. Internal conflict has the effect of denying control to both systems that are in conflict with each other. Conflict is usually transitory. When conflict becomes chronic, then symptoms of psychological disorder may appear.

Method
The core process is to redirect attention to the higher level control systems by recognizing "background thoughts", bringing them into the foreground, and then being alert for more background thoughts while the new foreground thoughts are explored. When the level-climbing process reaches an end state without encountering any conflicts, the need for therapy may have ended. When, however, this "up-a-level" process bogs down, a conflict has probably surfaced, and the exploration can be turned to finding the systems responsible for generating the conflict—and away from a preoccupation with the symptoms and efforts immediately associated with the conflict.

Results of evaluation studies
A randomised controlled trial in subjects with first-episode psychosis demonstrated that the retention in the trial at final follow-up was 97%, suggesting a successful feasibility outcome. The feedback provided by participants delivered initial evidence of the intervention for this population. The approach may also be effective in the treatment of sleep disorders and suicidality.

Filmography

Music videos
FIFA Soccer 64, known in Europe as FIFA 64 and in Japan as J. League Live 64, and in abbreviated form as just FIFA, is an association football video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts for the Nintendo 64. The cover features Manchester United midfielder Jordi Cruyff. The game garnered mixed reviews from professional critics upon release. Although its simulation was generally praised as realistic, reviewers critiqued the jerky animation, choppy frame-rates, unresponsive controls, and underwhelming usage of the Nintendo 64's capabilities. The Japanese version has officially licensed players and teams from Japan's J. League.

Gameplay 
Game options include Friendly, Exhibition, Playoff, Tournament, and League, and play modes include Simulation, Arcade, and Action. There are five control set-ups, Novice, Simple, Semi-Pro, Pro, and Complex. Passes and special moves are automatic on Novice, while there is no help from the computer on Pro and Complex. There are 160 international teams to choose from, such as those representing Argentina and Zambia, as well as teams of leagues local to the United States, France, Germany, England, and Italy. Matches in FIFA Soccer 64 are customizable in terms of time (maximum 90 minutes), weather, clock, display of time, auto replay, and whether fouls, injuries, and offside rule will be in play. 

Matches are announced by John Motson, Desmond Lynam, and Andy Gray. Although gameplay is similar to previous FIFA entries, there are a few introductions, including elements to the controls. In addition to being able to perform more tackles, the analog sticks allows players to be flexible with the moving speed (walk, jog, run, sprint), and the length a button is held determines the velocity of a pass or shot. Moves include trapping, rainbow kicks, bicycle kicks, butterfly kicks, tackles, slide tackles, lobs, fakes, and headers. "Passback mode" can also be activated when free kicks and goalie possession occur; the player controls the passer's movements, then commands the ball carrier to either shoot the ball into the net or kick it back to the passer. There are eight camera angles. They can be viewed with the Picture-in-Picture feature (new to the series), where the separate view can be switched between all the angles and a radar display. FIFA Soccer 64 offers the ability to manage a team, such as positions of individual players on a field, as well as choosing from six formations and five strategies.

Development 
FIFA Soccer was the Nintendo 64's first soccer simulation, as well as the first title to use Dolby Surround sound. Reports Game Informer, "Nintendo claimed that the N64 would strive to be the unparalleled sports platform." It is similar to the 32-bit versions of FIFA 97 and Japanese counterpart J. League Live 64, and was initially announced under the same title. High numbers of pre-orders for FIFA 64 led Electronic Arts to reverse its recent decision to withdraw from Nintendo 64 software development, instead announcing plans to release several EA Sports games for the Nintendo 64 over the next year.

Reception

The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.  Electronic Gaming Monthly named FIFA Soccer 64 Most Disappointing Sequel in their 1998 Video Game Buyer's Guide, commenting, "FIFA helped demonstrate the power of the 3DO when EA Sports introduced the world's first 32-Bit soccer game [FIFA International Soccer]. Most gamers hoping for another stunning introduction onto the N64 were let down ..." They cited clumsy-looking animation, weak gameplay, and poor frame rate. Peer Schneider felt it "simply looks rushed", "FIFA Soccer 64 boasts smart AI and a good license, but the game disappoints more than it impresses." Reviews, even positive ones, stated Konami's International Superstar Soccer 64 (1997) was the superior soccer title and recommended gamers to purchase it instead of FIFA Soccer 64, which, argued Next Generation, lacked the Konami title's "playability and realism". Stated Rubenstein, "FIFA Soccer 64 is EA Sports' highly-anticipated foray into the mighty N64 universe. But like EA's initial, stumbling Super Nintendo titles, FIFA Soccer 64 is plagued by confusion, recycled designs, and hampered execution." The most favorable reviewers included Joe Kidd of GameFan, who called FIFA Soccer 64 the best all-time soccer video game, Marc and Panda of Consoles +, who claimed it was the best in the FIFA series, and AllGames Brad Cook, who stated it "shows why EA Sports is the leader in sports games."

Some critics praised the simulation as realistic, in comparison to similar Nintendo 64 sports games at the time that were arcade-style. The players' names, attire, movements, and artificial intelligence were noted to be accurate, as well as the sound true to that of a real soccer game. Schneider and GamePro journalist Air Hendrix praised the players' animation, the look of the stadium, the crowd sound effects, and the varied, neutral, and on-time audio commentary. Kidd described the graphics as "smooth", also bringing up the "great camera angles" and background sound effects that reflect "a playoff atmosphere" and excite the player. A criticism towards the audio was from Nintendo Power, who found the commentary repetitive. Schneider noted the typos and inaccuracies in the team menus, such as Düsseldorf spelled as "Düsseldrf" in English text but correctly in German text, and Canadian teams falsely listed as US teams. Tim Weaver of N64 Magazine criticized the tackling as unconvincing, "with wayward foot-ins as close as you're going to get to emulating Adams or Southgate". Negative comments were also targeted at the console's blur causing a fuzzy look, Weaver additionally writing that the goal nets sometimes "billow out in the most ludicrous fashion".

Disappointment were expressed towards how little FIFA Soccer 64 took advantage of the Nintendo 64's capabilities. Alex Huhtala of Computer and Video Games noted inferiorities to the PlayStation release of FIFA 97, such as a lower amount of teams, the absence of a stadium, and inability to trade players between teams. From the perspective of GameSpots Glenn Rubenstein, the graphical improvements over other entries were too little for a game on the Nintendo 64. The animations, in particular, were "nowhere near as fluid" as the PlayStation FIFA titles. Tim Weaver of N64 Magazine complained the elements unique from other FIFA games were only "superficial" and towards the options menu, disappointing given the Nintendo 64 having double the power of the PlayStation. The only critic who stated otherwise was CNET Gamecenters Tom Ham, feeling the improved graphics, controls and A.I. indicated the highest usage of the Nintendo 64's power.

Weaver called the game "infuriatingly slow". Rubenstein argued most of the angles were "imperfect" and caused frame-rate drops. Schneider and Computer and Video Games reviewers Alex Huhtala and Steve Hey also reported jerky animations and frame-rates. Schneider experienced it the most in Picture-in-Picture and scrolling of the angles, and the least when the camera was the most distant from the action (Telecam). He argued that the problem was inexcusable as there was only a flat-textured landscape and players to render; Blast Corps (1997), by comparison, had several more elements going on at a time, and ran far better. Although Consoles + claimed the players were animated very lively, they criticized the ball animation as jerky.  

Of frequent note was the huge amount of options, Nintendo Power claiming FIFA Soccer 64 "has a little bit of everything and more variety than any other soccer game". The magazine's staff particularly found the ability to switch between camera angles "innovative". A frequently highlighted mode was the four-player. However, Electronic Gaming Monthlys Kraig Kujawa and Dean Hager disliked FIFA Soccer 64 for focusing more on having several options and less on the actual gameplay. Kujawa called features such as Picture-in-Picture a good novelty, but "useless". Computer and Video Games criticized Picture-in-Picture for slowing down the frame rate even more, adding that the separate view obscured a chunk of the main action, yet its frame was so small it was hard to see. Hendrix wrote that it still may disappoint gamers with its limited new features for the FIFA series (he felt there should have been more moves, custom players, and indoor-stadium options) and lack of "pizzazz and originality" Wave Race 64 had. Weaver criticized the tactics screen for being of little help, and the Picture-in-Picture feature for having the separate view so large it was difficult to focus on the main action. 

The controls were criticized as "unwieldy", "fiddly", "slow and unresponsive", "imprecise and confusing", "loose at best" and "sluggish". Kujawa attributed the problem to the poor animation of the otherwise nice-looking characters. Weaver noted their inconsistencies, meaning the buttons did not always execute the same results; an example was the two-second delay of the ball-shoot button: "As a result, you panic and try another button in the hope of producing something resembling a shot only to see your player sky one into the stand." Schneider also reported a delay on the button to switch players; he suggested a sound effect should have been played to indicate whether a player switch worked, as there was in Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey (1996). He also considered it weird that the characters could not be moved in analog, despite the game supporting the analog stick. Huhtala described executing passes as more based on luck than skill, "with players having the crazy habit of back heeling rather than going forward". The unnatural physics of the ball, such as abrupt de-accelerations, were also called out. Hendrix was one of few critics to report the passing and shooting working successfully, although stated the player switch mechanic kept "you out of the play".
USS Preble was a United States Navy sloop-of-war with 16 guns, built by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, launched June 13, 1839 and commissioned in 1840. She was named after Commodore Edward Preble (1761–1807).

Early Service

Preble first sailed for Labrador, and then went to cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in 1843. She was attached to the African Squadron in 1845. In 1846, Preble sailed for New York and joined the Pacific Squadron on the West Coast of the United States, where she participated in the Mexican–American War.

Sail to East Asia
In 1848, Captain James Glynn took her first to Hong Kong and then to Nagasaki, Japan, where she picked up some fourteen American and Hawaiian seamen who had become castaways in that "closed country".

In November 1850, she returned to the east coast of the United States, where she became a practice ship for midshipmen until 1857, when she was placed in ordinary service.

Civil War Service

During the American Civil War, in July 1861, Preble joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron and participated to the blockade of the Mississippi River. She was posted at Head of the Passes on the Mississippi River on 12 October 1861 when the blockading squadron there was attacked by a Confederate States Navy force that included the first ironclad warship, CSS Manassas. Being a sail-powered ship, she did not join the battle but rather made a swift retreat out the Southwest Pass to safety in the Gulf of Mexico.

Preble was serving as a guard ship when, on 27 April 1863, while moored in Pensacola Bay off Pensacola, Florida, she caught fire due to the carelessness of a crewman. She was abandoned and exploded.
Milton John Hinton (June 23, 1910 – December 19, 2000) was an American double bassist and photographer.

Regarded as the Dean of American jazz bass players, his nicknames included "Sporty" from his years in Chicago, "Fump" from his time on the road with Cab Calloway, and "The Judge" from the 1950s and beyond. Hinton's recording career lasted over 60 years, mostly in jazz but also with a variety of other genres as a prolific session musician.

He was also a photographer of note, praised for documenting American jazz during the 20th Century.

Biography

Early life in Mississippi (1910–1919) 
Hinton was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, United States, the only child of Hilda Gertrude Robinson, whom he referred to as "Titter," and Milton Dixon Hinton. He was three-months-old when his father left the family. He grew up in a home with his mother, his maternal grandmother (a former slave of Joe Davis, the brother of Jefferson Davis), and two of his mother's sisters.

His childhood in Vicksburg was characterized by extreme poverty and extreme racism. Lynching was a common practice at the time. Hinton said that one of the clearest memories of his childhood was when he accidentally came upon a lynching.

Growing up in Chicago (1919–1935) 

Hinton moved with his extended family to Chicago, Illinois, in late 1919, which created opportunities for him. Chicago was where Hinton first encountered economic diversity among African-Americans, about which he later noted, "That's when I realized that being black didn't always mean you had to be poor." It was also where he experienced an abundance of music, either in person or through live performances on the radio. During this time he first heard concerts featuring Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Eddie South, and many others.

Music was a fixture at home. His mother and other relatives regularly played piano. He received his first instrument – a violin – in 1923 for his thirteenth birthday, which he studied for four years. In addition to taking lessons on the violin, Hinton and his mother attended performances at the Vendome Theater every Sunday, featuring the orchestra of Erskine Tate with Louis Armstrong as a feature soloist.

After graduating from Wendell Phillips High School, Hinton attended Crane Junior College for two years, during which time he began receiving regular work as a freelance musician around Chicago. He performed with Freddie Keppard, Zutty Singleton, Jabbo Smith, Erskine Tate, and Art Tatum. Hinton soon taught himself to play the double bass because opportunities for violinists were limited. His first steady job began in the spring of 1930, playing tuba (and later double bass) in the band of pianist Tiny Parham. His recording debut on November 4, 1930, was on tuba with Parham's band on a tune titled "Squeeze Me." After graduating from Crane Junior College in 1932, attended Northwestern University for one semester, then dropped out to pursue music full-time. He received steady work from 1932 through 1935 in a quartet with violinist Eddie South, with extended residencies in California, Chicago, and Detroit. With this group he first recorded on double bass in early 1933.

The Cab Calloway era (1936–1950) 

In 1936, Hinton joined the Cab Calloway Orchestra, initially as a temporary replacement for Al Morgan, while the band was on tour en route to a six-month residency at the newly opened midtown location of the Cotton Club in New York City. He quickly found acceptance among the band members, and he ended up staying with Calloway for over fifteen years. Until the Cotton Club closed in 1940, the Calloway band performed there for up to six months per year, going on tour for the remaining six months of the year. During the Cotton Club residencies, Hinton took part in recording sessions with Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Billie Holiday, Ethel Waters, Teddy Wilson, and many others. It was at this time that he recorded what is possibly the first bass feature, "Pluckin' the Bass" in August 1939.

Hinton appeared regularly on radio while in Calloway's band, either on bass in concerts broadcast from the Cotton Club, or as a cast member for the short-lived music quiz show "Cab Calloway's Quizzicale." These broadcasts brought national attention to the Calloway band and helped enable the successful national tours the band would schedule. They also gave listeners a chance to hear examples of jive talk, which Calloway would formalize through publications such as his Hepster's Dictionary, first published in 1938.

Calloway's band included renowned sidemen such as Danny Barker, Chu Berry, Doc Cheatham, Cozy Cole, Dizzy Gillespie, Illinois Jacquet, Jonah Jones, Ike Quebec, and Ben Webster. Hinton credits Chu Berry with elevating the overall musicianship of the Calloway band, in part by encouraging Cab to hire arrangers such as Benny Carter, to create new arrangements that would challenge the musicians. As Hinton put it, "Musically he was the greatest thing that ever happened to the band." Hinton was also heavily influenced by the musical innovations of Dizzy Gillespie, with whom he had informal sessions in the late 1930s, during breaks between sets at the Cotton Club. Hinton credits Gillespie with introducing him to many of the experimental harmonic practices and chord substitutions, that would later be associated with bebop.

In 1939 when Hinton returned to Chicago for his grandmother's funeral, he met Mona Clayton, who was then singing in his mother's church choir. The two were married a few years later and remained inseparable for the rest of Milt's life. (Mona was his second wife; the first was a brief relationship in the 1930s with Oby Allen, a friend he knew from high school.) He and Mona's only child, Charlotte, was born on February 28, 1947. Mona had begun traveling with the Calloway Orchestra in the early 1940s — the only musician's friend or spouse to do so. She helped musicians in the band manage their money, and she often insisted that they open savings accounts. For band members, she was a trusted confidant who was known for her discretion. When traveling with a toddler became too difficult, the Hintons bought a two-family house in Queens, and ten years later they purchased a larger single-family home in an adjacent neighborhood where they remained for the rest of their lives.

In addition to caring for their daughter, Mona handled the family's finances, and her attention to detail ensured the couple's financial security later in life. She kept track of Hinton's freelance work, scheduled interviews, coordinated public relations events, and often drove him back and forth to gigs (Hinton never drove as an adult, due in part to a car accident he was involved in as a teenager in Chicago). In the mid-1960s, Mona completed both a bachelor's and a master's degree and taught in the public schools for several years. In the 1970s, she began traveling with Hinton again and was regularly invited to join him at jazz parties and festivals where he performed. At the same time, she was active as a music contractor for Lena Horne and others. Mona was always well respected in the jazz community, and she and Hinton were viewed by many as role models; as the jazz historian Dan Morgenstern noted in an article from 2000, "If there is a closer couple, I'd be surprised."

After Cab Calloway (1950–1954) 
By 1950, popular music tastes had changed, and Calloway lacked the funds to support a full big band. Instead, he hired Hinton and a few others to create a smaller ensemble, first a septet and later a quartet, which toured until June 1952, with trips to Cuba and Uruguay. After the Calloway ensemble disbanded, Hinton spent more time as a freelance studio musician in New York City. At first, the work was sporadic, and, as Hinton put it, "This was the one period in my life when I was worried about earning a living." He played as many clubs and restaurants as possible, a practice he would continue for the next several decades. He performed regularly at La Vie en Rose, the Embers, the Metropole, and Basin Street West, where he appeared with Jackie Gleason, Phil Moore, and Joe Bushkin. In the early 1950s, he performed with Count Basie for a brief time in the New York area.

Although his freelance work was increasing, in July 1953 Hinton signed a one-year contract to tour with Louis Armstrong. He described the decision as "very difficult" as it would force him to be away from his family, and it would also slow down the momentum he was gaining as a freelance musician in New York City. Steady pay and the opportunity to perform with Armstrong were persuasive, and Hinton performed dozens of concerts, including a tour of Japan, as a member of the band. When an opportunity to join the house band for a television show hosted by Robert Q. Lewis in New York opened up in February 1954, Hinton gave his notice to Armstrong and returned to Queens.

In the studios (1954–1970) 
For roughly the next two decades he performed regularly on numerous radio and television programs, including those hosted by Jackie Gleason, Robert Q. Lewis, Galen Drake, Patti Page, Polly Bergen, Teddy Wilson, Mitch Miller, Dick Cavett, and others. As he recalled, "I had a great situation because I was never on staff. That meant I'd get paid by the show. And since I never spent more than fifteen hours a week on rehearsals and shows, I always had free time to do record dates."

By far, his most regular work during this era was in the recording studio, where Hinton was among the first African-Americans to be regularly hired for studio contract work. From the mid-1950s through the early 1970s, he contributed to thousands of jazz and popular records, as well as hundreds of jingles and film soundtracks. He would regularly play on three three-hour studio sessions per day, requiring him to own multiple basses that he hired assistants to transport from one studio to the next. During this era, he recorded with everyone from Billie Holiday to Paul McCartney, Frank Sinatra to Leon Redbone, and Sam Cooke to Barbra Streisand. As Hinton summarized his time in the studios, "I might be on a date for Andre Kostelanetz in the morning, do one with Brook Benton or Johnny Mathis in the afternoon, and then finish up the day with Paul Anka or Bobby Rydell. At one time or another, I probably played for just about every popular artist around in those days."

Starting in the mid-1950s, he regularly worked in the studio with Hank Jones (piano), Barry Galbraith (guitar), and Osie Johnson (drums) in a group that informally became known as the New York Rhythm Section. The four played on hundreds of sessions together and even recorded an LP in 1956 that was titled, The Rhythm Section.

After the studios (1970–2000) 

By the late 1960s, studio work began dropping off, so Hinton incorporated more live performances into his schedule. He regularly accepted club gigs, most often at Michael's Pub, Zinno's, and the Rainbow Room where he performed with Benny Goodman, Johnny Hartman, Dick Hyman, Red Norvo, Teddy Wilson, and others. He also went back on the road, first with Diahann Carroll for a tour in Paris in 1966, and later with Paul Anka, Barbra Streisand, Pearl Bailey, and Bing Crosby. From the 1960s through the 1990s he traveled extensively to Europe, Canada, South America, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East, while also appearing throughout the U.S.

In 1968, he began performing as a part of Professionals Unlimited (later renamed the New York Bass Violin Choir), a collective bass ensemble organized by Bill Lee that included Lisle Atkinson, Ron Carter, Richard Davis, Michael Fleming, Percy Heath, and Sam Jones. The group performed irregularly for a number of years and in 1980 released a self-titled album on the Strata-East label (SES-8003) containing material recorded between 1969 and 1975.

Hinton taught for nearly twenty years, as a visiting professor of jazz studies at Hunter College and Baruch College, first offering a jazz workshop at Hunter in late 1973. During this time he regularly appeared at jazz festivals, parties, and cruises; performing annually at Dick Gibson's jazz parties in Colorado, the Odessa and Midland jazz parties in Texas beginning in 1967, and Don and Sue Miller's jazz parties in Phoenix and Scottsdale.

He played at the first Newport Jazz Festival in 1954 and was a regular at Newport and other jazz festivals produced by George Wein throughout the next four decades. He was a favorite at the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland, sponsored by Hans Zurbruegg and Marianne Gauer. In 1977, he recorded with Earl Hines and Lionel Hampton. For much of the 1980s and 1990s, Hinton was featured on jazz cruises organized by Hank O'Neal, then owner of Chiaroscuro Records.

By the 1990s, he was revered as an elder statesman in jazz, and he was regularly honored with significant awards and accolades. He received honorary doctorates from William Paterson College, Skidmore College, Hamilton College, DePaul University, Trinity College, the Berklee College of Music, Fairfield University, and Baruch College of the City University of New York. He won the Eubie Award from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Living Treasure Award from the Smithsonian Institution, and he was the first recipient of the Three Keys Award in Bern, Switzerland. In 1993, he was awarded the highly prestigious National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master Fellowship. He also contributed to the NEA's Jazz Oral History Program, continuing a longstanding practice of recording interviews with friends in his basement during extended visits. In 1996 he received a New York State Governor's Arts Award, in March 1998 he was awarded the Artist Achievement Award by the Governor of Mississippi, and in 2000 his name was installed on ASCAP's Wall of Fame.

In 1990, Hinton's 80th year, WRTI-FM in Philadelphia produced a series of twenty-eight short programs in which he chronicled his life. These were aired nationwide by more than one hundred fifty public radio stations and received a Gabriel Award that year as Best National Short Feature. In the same year George Wein produced a concert as a part of the JVC Jazz Festival in honor of Hinton's 80th birthday. Similar concerts were produced for his 85th and 90th birthdays. By 1996, he ceased performing on bass, due to a number of physical ailments, and he died at the age of 90 on December 19, 2000.

Musicianship 
Hinton was broadly regarded as a consummate sideman, possessing a sensitivity for appropriately applying his formidable technique and his extensive harmonic knowledge to the performance at hand. He was equally adept at bowing, pizzicato, and "slapping," a technique for which he first became famous while playing with the Cab Calloway Orchestra early in his career. He was also an accomplished sight-reader, a skill which he developed on the road with Calloway and honed during his several decades of studio work. As he described his technical diversity, "Working with Cab for sixteen years could have made me stale. You play the same music over and over, and after awhile you can do it in your sleep. Many guys liked it that way because it was easy. But when the band business got bad, they weren’t prepared to do anything else. On the other hand, I was able to work on radio and TV and get all kinds of record dates. In a real way, practicing and discipline paid off."

Hinton Photographic Collection 
Hinton received his first camera, a 35mm Argus C3, on his 25th birthday in 1935. He later moved on to a Leica, then a Canon 35mm range-finder, and by the 1960s to a Nikon F. Between 1935 and 1999 Hinton took thousands of photographs, approximately 60,000 of which now comprise the Milton J. Hinton Photographic Collection, co-directed by David G. Berger and Holly Maxson. The Collection includes 35mm black and white negatives and color transparencies, reference and exhibition-quality prints, and photographs given to and collected by Hinton throughout his life. The work depicts an extensive range of jazz artists and popular performers in varied settings - on the road, in recording studios, at parties, and at home - over a period of six decades.

Beginning in the early 1960s, Hinton and Berger worked together to organize the photographs and identify the subjects of the photos. In June 1981, Hinton had his first one-person photographic exhibition in Philadelphia, and since then items from the Collection have been featured in dozens of exhibits across the country and in Europe.

Photographs from the Collection have also regularly appeared in periodicals, calendars, postcards, CD liner notes, films, and books. Hinton and Berger co-wrote Bass Line: The Stories and Photographs of Milt Hinton (Temple University Press, 1988), and with the addition of Holly Maxson, the three co-wrote OverTime: The Jazz Photographs of Milt Hinton (Pomegranate Art Books, 1991) and Playing the Changes: Milt Hinton’s Life in Stories and Photographs (Vanderbilt University Press, 2008). Notable documentary films that have drawn upon the Collection include The Long Night of Lady Day (Billie Holiday), The Brute and the Beautiful (Ben Webster), and Listen Up (Quincy Jones). A Great Day in Harlem, a 1994 documentary about Esquire's photographic shoot of jazz legends in 1958, features numerous photographs by Milt as well as a home movie shot by Mona. In late 2002 Berger and Maxson utilized the Collection along with a number of original interviews with Hinton's friends and colleagues to produce the documentary film Keeping Time: The Life, Music & Photographs of Milt Hinton. It debuted at the London Film Festival, won the Audience Award at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2003, and has been shown at film festivals both domestically and abroad.

Hinton Collection at Oberlin College 
In 1980, in honor of Hinton's 70th birthday, his friends and associates worked to create the Milton J. Hinton Scholarship Fund, which was used to help support the musical studies of a variety of bass students over the next 35 years. In 2014 the fund was transferred to Oberlin College to provide scholarships to students attending the biennial Milton J. Hinton Summer Institute for Studio Bass, established at Oberlin College in 2014 and directed by Peter Dominguez, Professor of Jazz Studies and Double Bass at Oberlin. The institute is one component of a broader relationship between the Hinton Estate and Oberlin, which also includes:
 the acquisition by Oberlin of four of Hinton's basses, including the 18th-century bass that Hinton performed on for the majority of his career;
 the presence of the Milton J. and Mona C. Hinton Collection in the Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections, which comprises materials created or compiled by Milt and Mona Hinton over the course of their lives. The Collection includes date books, correspondence, financial records, artifacts, newspaper clippings, photographs, audio and moving image materials, and other ephemera that provide an unrivalled view of Hinton's life;
 an exhibition in 2014 at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College of 99 of Hinton's photographs, several dozen of which are now a part of the AMAM's permanent collection.
This relationship is in line with Hinton's longstanding goal to educate and inspire future generations of musicians. As he noted when discussing one of his own bass teachers, "For [Dmitri Shmuklovsky], passing on his skill and knowledge to the next generation was a solemn duty. It was a mission that went beyond his music. And looking back, I know his greatest gift was to teach me this strong sense of responsibility. It's the reason I've always tried to help young people. If someone wants to improve, if they have a sincere desire to learn, I've always tried to be there to give them whatever I can." The multifaceted relationship between the Hinton Estate and Oberlin College will ensure that Milt and Mona's legacy will be passed on to future generations.

John Froelich (November 24, 1849 – May 24, 1933) was an American inventor who lived in Froelich, Iowa, a small village in northeast Iowa which was named for his father. In 1892, John Froelich developed the first stable gasoline/petrol-powered tractor with forward and reverse gears.

John Froelich attended school in red robbin, and at the College of Iowa. There he learned a lot about machinery. After college, he decided he would build the very first gasoline-powered tractor to go both forward and reverse.

Designed by his blacksmith Will Mann and himself, Froelich was able to build a 16-horsepower (12 kW) tractor that could go both forward and backward by the year 1892. After completing the tractor, Froelich and Mann brought it to Langford, South Dakota, where they would connect it to a J.I. Case threshing machine, and thresh 72,000 bushels in 52 days.

Around 1895, he left Froelich, Iowa, and settled in Marshalltown, Iowa, then moved to St. Paul, Minnesota. He later developed a new type of clothes-washing machine he named the Froelich Neostyle Washer.

There is a museum in the small town of Froelich, Iowa where John Froelich assembled his first gasoline tractor.
Meghnad Jagdishchandra Desai, Baron Desai (born 10 July 1940) is an Indian-born naturalised British economist and former Labour politician.  He stood unsuccessfully for the position of Lord Speaker in the House of Lords in 2011.   He has been awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award in the Republic of India, in 2008. He is a Professor Emeritus of the London School of Economics.

Early life
Born in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, Desai grew up with two brothers and one sister. He is said to have gone to secondary school at age seven and matriculated at 14. He secured a bachelor's degree in economics from Ramnarain Ruia College, affiliated to the University of Mumbai, and then pursued a master's degree in economics from the Department of Economics (now called the Mumbai School of Economics and Public Policy) of University of Mumbai, after which he won a scholarship to University of Pennsylvania in August 1960. He completed his PhD in economics at Pennsylvania in 1963.

Political career
Desai has been active in the British Labour Party, becoming chairman between 1986 and 1992, and was made Honorary Lifetime and President of Islington South and Finsbury Constituency Labour Party in London. He was created a life peer as Baron Desai, of St Clement Danes in the City of Westminster, on 5 June 1991. He was a member of Labour Friends of Israel. Desai quit his Labour Party membership of 49 years over antisemitism concerns in November 2020, following the readmission of former Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn as a member.

Academic career

Early in his career, Desai worked as an Associate Specialist in the Department of Agricultural Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California. He became a lecturer at the London School of Economics in 1965 and professor of economics in 1983. At the LSE, he taught econometrics, macroeconomics, Marxian economics and development economics over the years. In the 1970s, he taught an idiosyncratic version of economic principles to freshers at the LSE (starting with Piero Sraffa). From 1990 to 1995, he headed LSE’s Development Studies Institute and lead LSE Global Governance from 1992 to 2003, the year of his retirement.

Desai wrote his first book Marxian Economic Theory in 1973 followed by Applied Econometrics in 1976 and Marxian Economics, a revised edition of his 1973 book in 1979.  He wrote Testing Monetarism, a critique of monetarism, in 1981.

Desai has written extensively publishing over 200 articles in academic journals and had a regular column in the British radical weekly Tribune during 1985–1994, in the Indian business daily Business Standard (1995–2001) and in Indian Express and Financial Express.  From 1984 to 1991, he was co-editor of the Journal of Applied Econometrics.  A selection of his academic papers was published in two volumes as The Selected Essays of Meghnad Desai in 1995.

In 2002, Desai's book Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism stated that globalisation would tend toward the revival of socialism. Desai analyses some of Marx's lesser known writings and argues that his theories enhance our understanding of modern capitalism and globalization. His work was well received, with The Guardian stating 'If only socialists had studied Marx properly, they would have known all along that capitalism would triumph. Meghnad Desai gets behind the slogans in Marx's Revenge'.

Desai also published a biography of Indian film star Dilip Kumar entitled Nehru's Hero: Dilip Kumar in the life of India (Roli, 2004). He has described the book as his "greatest achievement". Examining Kumar's films – some of which Desai has seen more than 15 times – he discovers parallels between the socio-political arena in India and its reflection on screen. He discusses issues as varied as censorship, the iconic values of Indian machismo, cultural identity and secularism, and analyses how the films portrayed a changing India at that time.

He is (2023)  chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) Advisory Board, an independent membership-driven research network.  It focuses on global policy and investment themes for off the record public and private sector engagement and analysis. He was also chairman of the Trustee's Board for Training for Life, Chairman of the Management Board of City Roads and on the Board of Tribune magazine.  

Since  retirement he has published Rethinking Islamism: Ideology of the New Terror (2006), The Route to All Evil: The Political Economy of Ezra Pound (2007), a novel Dead on Time, (2009) and The Rediscovery of India (2009).

Lord Desai serves as the founder chairman of the Meghnad Desai Academy of Economics in Mumbai (MDAE). MDAE offers a one-year post-graduate diploma in economics, offered jointly with Department of Economics (Autonomous), University of Mumbai. MDAE focuses on applied learning and case studies rather than on rote learning. Students participate in workshops and seminars with top economics and finance professionals from around the world.

Saif Al-Gaddafi thesis

In 2007, Desai was asked by the University of London to serve with Tony McGrew of the University of Southampton as one of the two examiners of the PhD thesis of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the then leader of Libya. They did not immediately accept the thesis, as it was found to be weak. The candidate was subjected to an oral examination for two and a half hours and Gaddafi was asked to revise and re-submit it. The revised version was subsequently accepted.

As Desai had already retired from the LSE he had no involvement with the donation from Saif Gaddafi's charity to the LSE. Learning from the press of these links between LSE and Libya, Desai demanded that the money be returned to the people of Libya. He expressed disappointment at a speech Saif Gaddafi subsequently made on Libyan state television declaring the Gaddafi family's willingness to "fight to the last bullet", observing that "he was not behaving as if he had had an LSE education."

Personal life

In 1970, Desai married his LSE colleague Gail Wilson, his first wife. She was the daughter of George Ambler Wilson, CBE. They had three children.

During the course of writing Nehru's Hero, Desai met Kishwar Ahluwalia (now Kishwar Desai), his second wife who worked as an editor for this book. On 20 July 2004 the couple married. Desai and 47-year-old Ahluwalia were both divorced and married at a registrar's office in London.

Desai is an atheist and is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. He is also a member of and an advisor to the 1928 Institute.

James Carroll Beckwith (September 23, 1852 – October 24, 1917) was an American landscape, portrait and genre painter whose Naturalist style led to his recognition in the late nineteenth and very early twentieth century as a respected figure in American art.

Biography
Carroll Beckwith, as he preferred to be known, was born in Hannibal, Missouri on September 23, 1852, the son of Charles and Melissa Beckwith. However, he grew up in Chicago where his father started a wholesale grocery business. His grandmother was Hannah Yale, member of the Yale family. In 1868, aged 16, he studied art at the Chicago Academy of Design under Walter Shirlaw until the great fire of 1871 destroyed everything (including much of the heart of the city). He then went to New York and studied at the National Academy of Design (of which he afterwards became a member) in New York City under Lemuel Wilmarth and later traveled on to Paris, staying there from November 1873 until 1878. In New York, he lived in his millionaire great-uncle's "Sherwood Studio Building", which was built specifically for artists, and was close to Cornelius Vanderbilt II House.

In Paris he took drawing courses with Adolphe Yvon and studied painting under Carolus Duran who in 1877 selected Beckwith and John Singer Sargent to help him with a mural for the Palais du Luxembourg. Returning to the United States in 1878, he gradually became a prominent figure in American art. His talents as a draftsman secured him a professorship at the Art Students League of New York, where he taught from 1878 to 1882 and from 1886 to 1887. As an artist, he concentrated mostly on portraits, figure studies, and detailed renderings of historical monuments, but he never lost his interest in decorative design. He married Bertha Hall on June 1, 1887, and his friend John Singer Sargent gave them a Venetian watercolor as a present.

Beckwith took an active part in the formation of The Fine Arts Society, and was President of the National Free Art League, which attempted to secure the repeal of the American duty on works of art. Among his portraits are those of William Merritt Chase (1882), Miss Jordan (1883), Mark Twain, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Allibone Janvier, John Schofield and William M. Walton. He taught at the Art Students League of New York - where Violet Oakley was one of his students.

Beckwith received many awards including an Honorable Mention at the Paris Exposition of 1889 and a Gold Medal at the Atlanta Exposition in 1895. He also won an award at the Exposition Universelle at Paris in 1899 for what is probably his most celebrated work, his 1886 portrait of William M. Walton. He won a gold medal at the Charleston Exposition in 1902 and exhibited at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904 showing his painting "The Nautilus" along with a portrait of his wife. Carroll returned to Paris in 1893 to paint a number of murals and then returned to the United States to paint murals on one of the domes in the Liberal Arts Building at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago later in 1893.
He lived in Italy from 1910 to 1914 and painted many en plein air studies of monuments, buildings, and landscapes.

James Carroll Beckwith died of a heart attack in his apartment at the Hotel Schuyler on West Forty-fifth Street in New York City on October 24, 1917, aged 65, after having taken a taxi cab ride with his wife in Central Park.

His papers, including his sketchbooks and the diaries he kept from 1871 until his death in 1917 are held by the National Academy of Design in New York City.

Kengtung, also spelt Kyaingtong, is a town in Shan State, Myanmar (formerly Burma). It is the principal town of Kengtung Township and the former seat of Kengtung State, a minor principality. Kengtung is located on the National Highway 4 (NH4) and at the AH2 and AH3 of the Asian Highway.

Etymology 
Owing to Kengtung's proximity to China and Thailand, the city is known by a number of exonyms and endonyms. The endonym used by Tai Khun and Tai Lue-speaking locals is Jeng Tung (ᨾᩨ᩠ᨦᨩᩭᨦᨲᩩᨦ) respectively. Other Shan speakers use the exonym Kengtung. The most common exonym, Kyaingtong, is derived from the Burmese approximation of Kengtung. The exonym of Chiang Tung is used by Thai speakers, while Chinese speakers use Jingdong.

History

The early history of Kengtung is made up of myths and legends. The oral tradition of the [Tai people] says that the ancient city of Kengtung was founded in the distant past by Tai Lue as the original inhabitants of the region, and was later reestablished by the grandson of King Mangrai after defeating the Tai Lue. This migration of the Chiang Mai dynasty in the 13th century, with the founding a new kingdom which was later named Lanna, has resulted in Kengtung having a different type of Tai population from the rest of the Shan State, the Tai Khün.

Kengtung, like other major towns in the Shan Plateau, was home to a Shan Saopha (Sawbwa). Kengtung was the capital of the Kengtung State, and had a palace, built by Sao Kawng Kiao Intaleng in 1905.

The city was seized and occupied by the Thai Phayap Army from 1942 until the end of the Second World War and became the headquarters of the Saharat Thai Doem territory. The headquarters of the regional military command of the Tatmadaw is in the town.

Geography
Kengtung contains several lakes. The largest, Naung Tung Lake, lies in the western part of the city, followed by Naung Kham Lake and Naung Yarng Lake to the south of the Kentung Roman Catholic Mission.

Transportation
The town is served by Kengtung Airport.

Kengtung is located on the National Highway 4 (NH4) and at the AH2 and AH3 of the Asian Highway.

Climate

Kengtung has a tropical wet and dry/ savanna climate (Köppen-Geiger classification: Aw) with a pronounced dry season in the low-sun months, no cold season, wet season is in the high-sun months. Temperatures are very warm throughout the year, although the winter months (December–February) are milder and nights can be quite cool. There is a winter dry season (December–April) and a summer wet season (May–November).

Thomas of Britain (also known as Thomas of England) was a poet of the 12th century. He is known for his Old French poem Tristan, a version of the Tristan and Iseult legend that exists only in eight fragments, amounting to around 3,300 lines of verse, mostly from the latter part of the story. It is calculated that this represents about one sixth of the original.

Works
Because Thomas's Tristan has an "obvious dependence" on Wace's Roman de Brut, which was completed by 1155, it is likely that Thomas wrote it after 1155, and probably by 1160, possibly for Eleanor of Aquitaine, since the work suggests close ties with the court of Henry II. Beyond this, the identity of the author is obscure. It has been speculated that he is to be identified with the "Thomas" who wrote the Romance of Horn, but this is unsupported. Tristan has similarities to the Tristan story Chevrefoil by Marie de France, but either author could have borrowed from the other, or both from a third source.

Although Thomas's own text is fragmentary, later adaptations of his work make it possible to reconstruct what is missing:
 Gottfried von Strassburg's Tristan (Middle High German), left incomplete c. 1210, though fortuitously it covers all those parts of Thomas's work which are lost. Gottfried expanded the story by about a third, while nonetheless remaining fairly faithful to Thomas.
 Brother Robert's Old Norse Tristrams saga ok Ísöndar (Saga of Tristram and Isond), written in 1226 (prose), condensing the story.
 The Middle English Sir Tristrem (verse, late 13th Century), a much abbreviated retelling.
 The Italian La Tavola Ritonda (prose, 14th century).

Thomas' version is the earliest known representative of the "courtly branch" of the legend, to which Gottfried's also belongs. This branch differs from the "common" or "primitive" versions of Béroul and Eilhart von Oberge, in that greater emphasis is placed on pleasing the sensibilities and expectations of a courtly audience. Some scholars have theorized an "Ur-Tristan", an original French version that inspired all later accounts. Joseph Bédier attempted to reconstruct this original from the evidence provided by the later versions.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters, or Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: Tournament Fighters in Europe, is the title of three different fighting games based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, produced by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Super NES and released during a period between 1993 and 1994. Konami produced a different fighting game based on the franchise each featuring a differing cast of characters for the platforms. All three versions of the game were re-released as part of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection in 2022. with online play using rollback netcode for the SNES version of the game.

NES version

The NES version of Tournament Fighters was the final game Konami released for the platform in North America and the PAL region in 1994. It was also the fifth TMNT game released for Nintendo home consoles. Unlike the other versions of Tournament Fighters, it was not released in Japan. Tournament Fighters was one of the few fighting games released for the NES during the fighting game boom.

The game's single-player Story mode has the player taking control of one of the four Turtles (Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo, and Donatello), as they hold a contest amongst themselves to see who is fit to take on Shredder's challenge. After defeating the first three opponents, the player proceeds to fight Casey Jones and then Hothead (a character based on the Dragon Warrior from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comics and the action figure of the same name) before the final match with the Shredder. In addition to the Story mode, the game also has two Versus modes (one against the CPU and another against a second player), as well as a four-player tournament mode. An option mode where the player can adjust the game's difficulty, continues, and speed is also available.

The gameplay follows many of the standard fighting game conventions. Battles consist of three-round matches and the first player to win two rounds is the victor. Each character has their own repertoire of basic punch and kick techniques, as well as command-based special moves. During battle, a flying monitor with Splinter's face will sometimes appear that will drop a red ball power-up at the middle of the stage that can be retrieved by either fighter. Whoever retrieves the ball power-up will be able to use it by inputting the appropriate command.

The NES version allows the player to match any character against a clone of himself, with the exception of Hothead. The game does not allow such a match under normal circumstances, but there is a way to bypass this restriction in the game's "Vs. CPU" mode. The second Hothead will be colored differently, as with all same character matches in the game, but the game will also flicker due to the large size of both characters.

In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, the NES version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters has three enhancememts.

 Remove slowdown – This enhancement removes slowdown when too many characters are on screen, therefore allowing fast action at all times.
 Remove sprite flicker – This enhancement removes the NES limitations of the character sprites and backgrounds, providing for smoother animation during gameplay.
 Clash of the Hotheads – This enhancement allows more than one player to play as Hothead in the Tournament and Versus Mode, but it is most recommended that the "remove sprite flicker" enhancement (and maybe the "remove slowdown" enhancement, as well) is activated along with this enhancement first.

Super NES version

A tournament has been organized and many fighters have entered, Shredder being one of them. The Turtles decide to participate in order to stop their nemesis as well as proving their strength in the tournament.

This game's controls use a four-button scheme (two punches and two kicks, weak and strong). A particular feature is the possibility to use a super special attack. In order to achieve this, the player must fill a green bar under the life bar, by hitting their opponents. Once full, the player must press the two strong attack buttons simultaneously. There is also the option of enhancing the speed of the game, making the fights more intense but also more difficult to follow.

In addition to the main and versus modes, there is a story mode in which the Turtles must rescue April O'Neil and Splinter from Karai's clutches. The Turtles must travel across the US in their Turtle Blimp, defeating other fighters and collecting information. Only the four of them can be playable whereas the other characters are the opponents, including clone versions of the Turtles. There is no Mutagen Meter in story mode. There is also a watch mode, which features computer-controlled characters.

There are ten characters available, plus two bosses. Aside from the Turtles and Shredder (who goes under the name of Cyber Shredder in this game), these characters are also available:
War – A monstrous purple creature with big claws, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comics published by Archie. The game version of the character is said to be an alien in the game's Tournament mode as well as a mutant by the Turtles in the game's story mode.
Aska – A ninja girl seeking to open her own dojo. Aska is an original character (created by Takemasa Miyoshi) who makes her first and only appearance in the franchise. She is inspired by Mitsu from the film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, and was originally intended to be Mitsu, but her character was renamed after the film's poor reception. 
Wingnut – A humanoid, alien bat who appeared in several issues of the Archie Comics series, as well as in an episode of the animated series.
Chrome Dome – An android from the animated series, he was initially created by Shredder to destroy the Turtles.
Armaggon – A mutant shark from the future. Also from the Archie Comics series.

The bosses are:
Rat King – A deranged man who cast away his humanity and considers himself a rat, even though he has not been mutated.
Karai – The leader of the Foot Clan in Japan. She had only appeared in the original comics by Mirage Studios at the time of the game's release.

Regional differences
The Super NES version of Tournament Fighters was later released in Japan under the title Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Warriors. There's also some more slight differences: Aska's outfit is more revealing and she has a different win animation. The turtles sound more like teenagers and their character icons are different.

In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, the SNES version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters has four enhancements, with them having been featured in the original as Button Codes.

 Playable bosses – Allows the player to play as Rat King and Karai in Versus Mode.
 Extra versus stages – Allows two additional stages to be accessible in Versus mode.
 Maximum speed – Grants the player access to the hi-speed 3 feature in the in-game options menu.
 Extra lives – Allows the player to select up to 10 credits for Story Mode in the in-game options menu.

Genesis version

The Genesis/Mega Drive version of Tournament Fighters was released in North America, the PAL region, and Japan around the same time as its SNES counterpart.

The Genesis version uses the standard three-button controller, with only two buttons for attacking (punch and kick). To perform stronger punches or kicks, the player must hold the directional pad towards the opponent while pressing either attack buttons. The third button is used for taunting. Some of the stages in the game feature destroyable scenery that gives the player and their opponent access to new areas in the stage. As well as their special moves, each character has a 'killer' attack which is only accessible when they are close to death and the red part of the characters' life gauge at the top starts flashing. This is done by pressing the Taunt button in conjunction with a specific D-Pad motion. These moves nearly take out the other character's life gauge completely.

The game has eight playable characters, which includes the four Turtles and Casey Jones, as well as April O'Neil (whose active role differs from the versions of the character featured in other games), Ray Fillet (a character from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comics), and Sisyphus (an original character, named Musha Beetle in the Japanese version). The player can adjust their power and speed after selecting their character. The music in this version was composed by renowned video game composer Miki Higashino, in collaboration with Masanori Adachi.

The main single-player mode features the turtles and their allies traveling to various planets in Dimension X, fighting against clones of themselves, as they seek to rescue Splinter from Krang. After defeating the eight clones, the player travels to the final three stages to fight against a Triceraton, Krang's Android, and Karai (in that order). The game has a two-player mode, as well as a practice mode in which the player faces the computer in a 1-round match, and a "Tournament" mode where the player must defeat 88 opponents with one life gauge.

In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, the Genesis version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters has the sole enhancement of playable bosses, allowing the player to play as the Triceraton, Krang and his Android, and Karai in any game mode, increasing the number of playable characters from 8 to 11.

Each of the 3 boss characters is represented by a silhouetted character icon located above the original 8 playable characters. Each boss character's silhouetted icon is outlined in a different color, and below each icon is their respective character's name. Choosing one of the three allows to play as that character.

Reception

In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling SNES game in January 1994.

The SNES version received positive reviews, whereas the Sega version received mixed reviews. In 1993, Aska was rated as #4 on the list of "Top Ten Fighting Women" by Electronic Gaming Monthly. In the same issue Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Sega Genesis version average reviews, noting the game is not a good as the SNES version and stating “There aren’t many moves and the fighters are unappealing. The game also has a darker look and feel.” Mega magazine gave the Sega Genesis an average review score criticizing the games sluggish gameplay, unresponsive controls and stating “It’s an uninspired beat-em-up that’s borrowed everything from Street Fighter 2 but the gameplay.” GamePro magazine gave the SNES version ratings (out of 5) of 4.5 for graphics, 4.5 for sound, 5.0 for control and 5.0 for fun factor. GameFan scored the SNES version 369/400 and the Genesis version 248/400. SNES Force gave the SNES version a 90% score.

In 1995, Total! ranked the game 61st on its Top 100 SNES Games summarizing: "This is a shockingly good beat-'em-up considering it's a license.
Jarret Lee Stoll (born June 24, 1982) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, New York Rangers and Minnesota Wild.

Stoll is a two-time Stanley Cup champion, winning with Los Angeles in 2012 and 2014. He is currently part of the player development department for the Kings.

Playing career

Minor
Stoll played his early minor hockey in Saskatchewan. He started in the small town of Neudorf, shortly thereafter moving on to minor hockey in Melville, and then to Yorkton, Saskatchewan. In 1997, Stoll helped the Yorkton Bantam AAA Terriers to a Western Canadian Championship. While in Yorkton, Stoll attended St. Paul's Elementary School and Sacred Heart High School. He has an older brother, Kelly, who played for the Yorkton Terriers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL), and a younger sister Ashley, who played for the University of Saskatchewan Huskies women's hockey team.

After winning the bantam championship, Stoll moved on to play for the Saskatoon Blazers of the Saskatchewan Midget Triple A Hockey League. While in Saskatoon, Stoll attended St. Joseph High School. Prior to joining the Blazers, Stoll was the first overall pick of the 1997 WHL Bantam Draft by the Edmonton Ice.

Junior
Stoll started his Western Hockey League (WHL) career at the end of the 1997–98 season with the Ice, while they were still located in Edmonton. After this season, the team relocated to Cranbrook, British Columbia, and were renamed the Kootenay Ice. He played his entire junior career with the Ice franchise. In his third season, he was named team captain. In his final junior season (2001–02), Stoll captained the Ice to a Memorial Cup championship.

While playing in Kootenay, Stoll went through the NHL draft process twice. In his initial year of eligibility, he was selected by the Calgary Flames 46th overall in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, but was unable to come to terms with the team. The Flames arranged a trade to the Toronto Maple Leafs, who thought they had made arrangements to have a contract signed by the appropriate deadline, but their fax to NHL headquarters did not make it in time. Stoll ended up re-entering the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, where he was selected by the Edmonton Oilers 36th overall.

Also during his junior career, Stoll twice represented his country at the World Junior Hockey Championships, in 2001 and 2002, winning bronze and silver medals respectively.  In 2002, Stoll was named captain for Team Canada.

Professional

Edmonton Oilers
After completing his junior career with Kootenay, Stoll entered the Oilers system, and suited up for the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2002–03. During the season, he received his first call-up to the Oilers and played in his first four NHL games, registering an assist as his first career point. In 2003–04, he skated with the Oilers full-time. During the lock-out season of 2004-05, Stoll returned to the AHL to play with the Edmonton Roadrunners.

Stoll resumed playing with the Oilers during the 2005–06 season. During a game against the Vancouver Canucks on February 4, 2006, Stoll set an Oilers record by winning 21 of 22 faceoffs (95.45%) taken. The 2005–06 season marked Stoll's first Stanley Cup playoffs appearance, highlighted by his game-winning goal in overtime of Game 3 of the Western Conference Quarter-finals against the Detroit Red Wings. Entering the 2007–08 season, Stoll was named one of the Oilers alternate captains for the team's road games.

Los Angeles Kings
On June 29, 2008, Stoll was traded to the Los Angeles Kings (along with Matt Greene) in exchange for Ľubomír Višňovský. On September 5, the Kings signed Stoll to a four-year contract worth $14.4 million. In 2008–09, Stoll scored 18 goals with 23 assists for 41 points. On April 22, 2012, he scored the series-winning goal in overtime to eliminate the Vancouver Canucks—the winners of the Presidents' Trophy—in Game 5 of the Western Conference Quarter-finals.

On June 11, 2012, Stoll won his first Stanley Cup with the Los Angeles Kings, their first championship in history of the franchise, against the New Jersey Devils. Subsequently, he signed a three-year, $9.75 million contract on June 25 to remain with the Kings. On June 13, 2014, Stoll won his second Stanley Cup with the Kings, in Game 5 against the New York Rangers.

New York Rangers and Minnesota Wild 
On August 10, 2015, Stoll signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with the New York Rangers. Stoll made his debut with the Rangers as the team's fourth line centre on opening night of the 2015–16 season in a 3–2 victory over the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, on October 7, 2015. After 29 games with the Rangers and contributing with just one goal and three points, Stoll was waived by the Rangers. On December 15, 2015, he was claimed off waivers by the Minnesota Wild.

As a free agent from the Wild at the conclusion of the season, Stoll was unable to sign an NHL contract, opting to sign a professional try-out contract ("PTO") to attend the Columbus Blue Jackets' training camp on August 30, 2016. However, he was released from his PTO on October 5, 2016. Although Stoll never officially announced his retirement, he signaled an end to his playing career by accepting a job as a talent scout for the Los Angeles Kings on December 15, 2016.

Personal life
From 2006 to 2011, Stoll hosted his annual charity golf tournament in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, which benefits the Jarret Stoll Comfort Fund.

Stoll's Los Angeles home was featured on MTV Cribs in 2011.

In the summer of 2015, Stoll was arrested for possession of cocaine and ecstasy at a hotel in Las Vegas. He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors in the case in June 2015.

Stoll was engaged to model and actress Rachel Hunter, and they planned to marry in August 2009, but the wedding was called off. He began a relationship with sportscaster Erin Andrews in 2012. On December 9, 2016, it was announced he and Andrews were engaged. They were married on June 24, 2017. Andrews and Stoll chose a fertility plan of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Their son was born in July 2023 via surrogacy.

Awards and honours
Lefter Küçükandonyadis (Lefteris Antoniadis; 22 December 1925 – 13 January 2012) was a Turkish professional footballer of Greek descent, who played as a forward. He is often recognized as one of the greatest strikers to play for Fenerbahçe and Turkey. Having won several regional and national championship titles with Fenerbahçe and becoming Turkish top scorer twice in his career, he left an imprint on the history of the club. Lefter is one of a few players whose names are included in the Fenerbahçe Anthem. He was also known as "Ordinaryüs" (professor of professors) in Turkey.

Club career

Lefter started his footballing career on Büyükada (an island in Istanbul) but professionally played first with Taksim SK, a club based in the European part of Istanbul. He transferred to Fenerbahçe in 1947, achieving instant success. He won the National Division championship in 1950, his first nationwide championship title with the club, becoming the Turkish top scorer in the same edition.  He was one of the first Turkish footballers to play abroad, playing during 1951–1953 for ACF Fiorentina in Italy and OGC Nice in France. Returning to Fenerbahçe, he won two Istanbul League titles and later, after the start of the Turkish Super League, three Turkish League (1959, 1961 and 1964) titles. In the 1947–48 and 1953–54 seasons, he became the leading goalscorer of the Istanbul League. Overall, he scored a total of 423 goals in 615 games for Fenerbahçe. After ending his career in Turkey in 1964, he played a single season in Greece with AEK Athens at the age of 39. He scored twice in an away 7–1 victory against Apollon Smyrnis and became the eldest goalscorer in the history of the club. These goals also made his the eldest goalscorer in the history of Greek Championship, until he was surpassed by Tasos Mitropoulos in 1997. He participated in only five games in the season, as an injury in the match against Iraklis forced his retirement.

International career

Küçükandonyadis was capped 46 times for the Turkey national team, 9 as the captain. He also played at the 1948 Summer Olympics, and the 1954 FIFA World Cup netting in two goals, one against West Germany and the other against South Korea. He scored 21 goals for the national team and was the top scorer for Turkey until overtaken by Hakan Şükür. He was the first Turkish football player to receive the "Golden Honor Medal" from the Turkish Football Federation for having played for the national selection in 50 international matches.

Managerial career
Lefter coached Egaleo in Greece and Johannesburg in South Africa. He later returned to Turkey to coach clubs, mostly Samsunspor, Orduspor, Mersin İdman Yurdu, and Boluspor.

After football
His statue was erected next to the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in 2009. He was buried in the Greek Orthodox cemetery on his native island.

Personal life
Both of his parents were of Greek origin, Christofis Antoniadis, a fisherman, and Argyro Antoniadis, a tailor, who had immigrated from Ottoman Albania to the island of Büyükada in Istanbul in the early 20th century. He grew up with ten brothers and sisters, and had a Greek Orthodox upbringing. One of his brothers, Panagis Antoniadis, played for Pera Club. His family took part in the exodus of ethnic Greeks from Turkey during his childhoodexcept for his father. Due to his small stature, the Turks gave him the nickname Küçük, Turkish for "The Small", and Lefter added it to his surname – Küçükandonyadis, meaning "The Small Antoniadis". He was married to a fellow Greek woman, Stavriani Bekiari, and they had three children.

The Crenshaw Company was a blockade running company established during the American Civil War.

The company was founded by the brothers James and William Crenshaw of Richmond, Virginia. They had numerous steamers built on behalf of the confederacy to run supplies between Bermuda, Nassau, England, and Wilmington, North Carolina. James was the agent in Nassau, and William the agent in Liverpool.

In early 1864, they contracted with Atlantans Richard Peters and Vernon Stevenson, and Richard Wilson to move cotton from the interior to the best remaining Confederate port at that time, Wilmington.

Wilson negotiated sales to England for return cargoes of beef, pork and coffee as well as materials for the assembly of cotton bales (iron hoops and gunny cloth).

During that time, the Captains were Englishman George M. Horner and Michael Philip Usina of Savannah and two steamers: Marie Celeste and Atlanta.

First voyage was Usina on the new sidewheeler Marie Celeste from Wilmington to Bermuda with 1,000 bales of cotton. The Atlanta was completed in March 1864 and reached Bermuda in April and in the next three months made four trips to Wilmington, the last of which (with Captain Usina) was a close scrape with the Union blockade in which he was able to escape into the Cape Fear River and make his delivery.

On June 20, 1864, both ships were at port in St. George, Bermuda.

Marie Celeste left Bermuda on September 26, 1864, for Wilmington with a full cargo of canned meats but struck a reef and sank in 6 minutes. The ship was a total loss and the wreck is now a diving attraction.
The Democratic Unionist Party, also referred to by itself as the Original Democratic Unionist Party, is a political party in Sudan, closely tied to the Khatmiyya Sufi order.

Established in 1952 as the National Unionist Party (NUP), it is one of two political parties predating Sudan's independence, along the Umma Party. Founded by Mohammed Uthman al-Mirghani II's Khatmiyya order and Ismail al-Azhari's urban nationalist Ashigga Party (est. 1943), it is often considered Sudan's oldest political party. Having won a clear majority in Sudan's first parliamentary election, al-Azhari became Sudan's first prime minister, who in 1955 declared independence from colonial rule.

The party broke apart in 1956, with the Khatmiyya order founding the new People's Democratic Party (PDP), but reunited in 1967, resulting in the current name. In 1986, DUP leader Ahmed al-Mirghani became President of Sudan until ousted by Omar al-Bashir's military coup in 1989. While the party's official leadership around Muhammad Uthman al-Mirghani II remained in exile, the Khartoum-based Political Secretariat seceded in 2011, resulting in the rivalling the "Registered" Democratic Unionist Party led by Jalal al-Digair.

The party emerged in 1952 from the historic approach of the Khatmiyya Sufi order, founded in the first half of the 19th century by Mohammed Uthman al-Mirghani II, and Ismail al-Azhari's urban nationalist Ashigga Party, established in 1943. In Sudan's first parliamentary election the NUP won a legislative majority, making al-Azhari the first Sudanese Prime Minister under British–Egyptian colonial rule. On 19 December 1955, shortly after the First Sudanese Civil War had broken out, al-Azhari, declared the Independence of Sudan. Internal divisions between the al-Azhari faction and the Khatmiyya order however led to a split in 1956, with the Khatmiyya order founding the new People's Democratic Party (PDP). The party subsequently lost its majority, but remained a major political force even after General Abboud's short-lived 1958 coup d'état.

Al-Azhari and PDP leader Muhammad Uthman al-Mirghani reunited in 1967/Dec in the presence of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. Reestablished under the new name Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the party won the 1968 election and subsequently formed a coalition government with the Umma Party. The government's proposal of a basically Islamic constitution making Sudan a Muslim Arab state, however lead to Colonel Nimeiry's second coup d'état and the abolition of the parliament.

The party shortly returned to the political landscape in the 1986 election, where it won the largest number of votes though came second in number of seats having allowed too much freedom to its membership for constituency nominations. Ahmed al-Mirghani became President of Sudan, until ousted by Omar al-Bashir's 1989 military coup. Since then, the party's Chairman remained outside Sudan while allowing its members to freely decide on the degree of participation in central and state governments. In November 2022, following General al-Burhan's coup in 2021, party leader Mohamed Osman al-Mirghani returned to lead the party from Sudan, then shortly returned to Egypt where he resides for the last 3 decades.

Ideology

The party's main platform is in favour of a united Sudan, and previously Sudan and Egypt the downstream Nile River riparians.

The basic intellectual underpinnings of the party since its general congress in late 1960s, are: democratic pluralism politically, a mixed economy economically, and the establishment of a secular country towards as "the only acceptable way for peaceful coexistence in a country with different components of ethnic, tribal, religious, intellectual and cultural aspects in order to ensure the principle of that 'The sole basis of rights and duties should be based upon the Citizenship alone'."

The party has long-standing relations with the SPLM with whom it signed the Peace Deal of November 1988 in Ethiopia which was then opposed by the NIF party. It also enjoys good relationships with almost all the Sudanese political groups.

The last legislative elections, December 2000, were boycotted by the party, as most of the political groups, described as unfair and rigged.

Through the National Democratic Alliance it played a major role in the opposition to the NIF regime in Sudan during 1989-2005 until the signing of the Cairo Peace Agreement between the NDA and the government of Sudan. As a consequence of its stances the DUP has suffered continuous attempts to divide and weaken it by the Sudanese security forces and the ruling party of Sudan, which seem to have failed so far.

Since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the SPLM and the government of Sudan, the party's position has shifted towards a more mediatory role attempting to re-align the old and new opposition parties in a comprehensive stance to tackle the broader Sudanese issues such as unity, elections and transition into democracy avoiding polarisation which it views as damaging to the long term interests of the country.

It continues to view the National Democratic Alliance as a long-term alliance that could rightly guide the political movement in Sudan.

The Magic Club of Vienna, or the Magischer Klub Wien as it is referred to in local circles, is the oldest association of magicians in Austria. It was founded in 1908 and has become a welcome meeting point for amateur and professional magicians. During World War II the Magic Club of Vienna became a regional branch of the German Magic Circle.

In 1958 and 1976 the "International Federation of Magic Societies" (FISM) entrusted the club to organize the World Congress of Magic in Vienna. The Magic Club of Vienna is a founding member of FISM, and also initiated the Magischer Ring Austria (Magic Ring of Austria), but to which it no longer belongs.

In 1989 Magic Christian became president of the club. In the same year he founded the first Young Magician's Club in Austria.

Today the Magic Club of Vienna has more than 34 adult and around 20 junior members; the latter group are taught the art of magic in their Young Magicians Club.
The Fairfield City Council is a local government area in the west of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The council was first incorporated as the "Municipal District of Smithfield and Fairfield" on 8 December 1888, and the council's name was changed to the "Municipality of Fairfield" in 1920, before being proclaimed a city in 1979. The City of Fairfield comprises an area of  and as of the  had a population of . The mayor of the City of Fairfield is Cr. Frank Carbone, the first popularly-elected independent mayor of Fairfield.

Fairfield is considered one of the most ethnically diverse suburbs in Australia. At the 2016 census, the proportion of residents in the Fairfield local government area who stated their ancestry as Vietnamese and Assyrian, was in excess of sixteen times the national average. The area was linguistically diverse, with Vietnamese, Arabic, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, or Cantonese languages spoken in households, and ranged from two times to seventeen times the national averages.

The Smithfield–Wetherill Park Industrial Estate is the largest industrial estate in the Southern Hemisphere and is the centre of manufacturing and distribution in GWS, with more than 1,000 manufacturing, wholesale, transport and service firms.

Geography
A few small areas of the original bushland remain, including examples of Cumberland Plain Woodland, which is listed under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, and the Cooks River/Castlereagh Ironbark ecological community. There are 580 parks (60 of which are major parks), including one of the largest urban parks in the world, Western Sydney Parklands, which has a precinct that lies in the Fairfield area, called the Western Sydney Regional Park. Fairfield City is mainly residential in nature with large-scale industrial estates at Wetherill Park and Smithfield. Fairfield Showground is an important cultural venue. Prominent roads such as Cumberland Highway and The Horsley Drive wind through it.

History

For more than 30,000 years, Aboriginal people from the Cabrogal–Gandangara tribe have lived in the area.

One of Sydney's oldest trees, the Bland Oak, was planted in the 1830s in Carramar. European settlement began early in the 19th century and was supported by railway construction in 1856. At the turn of the century the area had a population of 2,500 people and with fertile soils, produced crops for distribution in Sydney. The council was first incorporated as the "Municipal District of Smithfield and Fairfield" on 8 December 1888, becoming the "Municipality of Smithfield and Fairfield" from 1906. On 26 October 1920, the council's name was changed to the "Municipality of Fairfield", in recognition of the changing centre of business in the council area.

Rapid population increase after World War II saw the settlement of many ex-service men and European migrants. Large scale Housing Commission development in the 1950s swelled the population to 38,000. From 1 January 1949, under the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, the Municipality of Cabramatta and Canley Vale was amalgamated into the Municipality of Fairfield. In the , the population had reached 114,000 and was becoming one of the larger local government areas in New South Wales. On 18 May 1979, the Municipality of Fairfield was granted city status, becoming the "City of Fairfield".

On Friday 29 June, 2001 the former deputy mayor of Fairfield and councillor from 1987 to 1998, Phuong Ngo, was convicted of the 1994 murder of the local state MP for Cabramatta (and former deputy mayor), John Newman, a crime which has been described as Australia's first political assassination. Ngo's alleged accomplices, Quang Dao and David Dinh, were acquitted and the identity of the killer who shot and fatally wounded Newman remains a mystery. Controversy has arisen in the years since then of the presence of Ngo's name on various council plaques from his time on council.

In September 2006, Fairfield Council announced the introduction of a trial ban on spitting in public on public health grounds. However, it was reported that advice provided to council from NSW Health was that spitting does not impact on the transmission of infectious diseases. The law proved difficult to prosecute.

The median weekly income for residents within the City of Fairfield was lower than the national average, being one of the factors that place the city in an area of social disadvantage.

As at the 2016 census, the influence of Vietnamese culture and language was statistically strong, evidenced by the proportion of residents with Vietnamese ancestry (nearly twenty times higher than the national average), the proportion of residents who spoke Vietnamese as either a first or second language (also nearly twenty times higher than the national average), and the proportion of residents who stated a religious affiliation with Catholicism and Buddhism (the latter being in excess of nine times the national average).

Random (Marshall Evan Stone III) is a fictional character and antihero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Peter David for the series X-Factor. He was originally presented as an opponent of X-Factor, but he later became their reluctant ally.

Fictional character biography
The complete origin of Random is unclear. It appears that he was created from a mass of protoplasm by Dark Beast, making Random the continuation of an experiment that Dark Beast began while Sinister's lead scientist in the Age of Apocalypse reality. It is also possible that Random was born normally and then captured and experimented on by Dark Beast. Following Dark Beast's experimentation, the young Random is given the name of Alex, and he uses this name while serving as McCoy's helper in the sewers beneath New York City when he worked with the Morlocks.

"Alex" eventually escapes, shifting his appearance to that of a muscle-bound man and creating the identity of bounty hunter Random. It is unknown if the name Marshall Evan Stone III is his real name or just a name he created for his new Random persona. According to the memories of Charlie Ronalds, a person with Random's powers killed Charlie's parents when Charlie was very young, though Random has never been confirmed as the killer.

In his first encounter with the government-sponsored X-Factor team, Random is called in (presumably by the government) to bring back a group of Genoshan renegades called the X-Patriots, who refuse to leave a hospital where one of their comrades is being treated. Random and X-Factor clash and, wanting to end the fight quickly, team leader Havok buys out Random's contract.

Because of his success as a bounty hunter, Random is contracted to go after X-Factor member Polaris. During their battle, Random tells her that the same government that employs her hired him to kill her. Polaris doesn't believe him, but he assures her that there are mutant haters in the government. After a brief scuffle, Polaris leaves, later confessing to Havok that she felt Random was holding back during the fight, as if he wanted her to win.

Joining X-Factor
After X-Factor encountered the religious fanatic Haven, Random visits X-Factor members Wolfsbane and Strong Guy, confessing to them that the government agents who had previously hired him are now after his life as well. In exchange for protection, he agrees to tell X-Factor who hired him to kill Polaris. The team sets out to find Haven, and Forge hires Random's services against Haven for $15,000 and a new car, so he tags along. When they locate Haven, she transports Random and the rest of X-Factor to a pocket dimension where she shows them how much they really need her. In this world, Random begins to revert to his protoplasmic state, causing Haven to point out that she knows the truth behind his bloodthirsty façade. When she returns the team to the real world, Random is completely gelatinous but quickly pulls himself together and refuses to talk to the team about it.

Following Haven's defeat, Forge pays Random and offers him a permanent job on the team, which he declines. Shortly thereafter, Random, Forge, and Polaris track down Colonel Malone, the man who hired Random to kill Polaris. The trio find him, but he commits suicide before they can question him. However, Malone's assistant informs them that the government never planned on killing Polaris—they only wanted to test her limits as part of their plan to use her as a fail-safe against Magneto. If Random had defeated her, she would have been brought in and brainwashed to become the government's weapon.

The Brotherhood
Random returns after Havok re-forms the Brotherhood of Mutants with Dark Beast, Fatale, and Aurora, among others. He and Havok clash until Havok reveals to him the true nature of his mission: He is attempting to undermine the Brotherhood from within. The duo then help liberate the subjects of some of McCoy's inhumane experiments.

Random is next hired by Exodus (along with Feral, Pyro, Avalanche, the Fenris twins, and Omega Red) to assist the Acolytes. Exodus promises to help his new operatives find a cure for the Legacy Virus if they capture the Knights of Wundagore, but when they fail, Exodus leaves them stranded in the Savage Land.

Random resurfaces on Genosha during Magneto's rule and is quickly dispatched when the ad hoc Genoshan Assault X-Men squad attacks the island to rescue Professor X.

Weapon X

Random is later captured by the refurbished Weapon X Program in their attempt to exterminate mutants. He is placed in Neverland, a mutant concentration camp, and attempts a coup with the help of Diamond Lil. However, the inmates don't realize that their powers are being negated by Leech, and they are both severely punished for their actions.

Post M-Day
Random is one of the few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after M-Day. Alongside Tempo, Unuscione, and Frenzy, Random again works with Exodus, joining his new team of Acolytes and participating in an attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.

Random and the Acolytes later attack the Xavier Institute on a mission from Mister Sinister to retrieve Destiny's diaries. The diaries they find are fake, and after a battle with Colossus, Shadowcat, and several students, the Acolytes are forced to return to Sinister without completing their mission. Random is present with the rest of the Acolytes in the final battle of "Messiah Complex".

X-Men: Legacy
When Professor Xavier returns to New Avalon to confront Exodus, Random is still among the Acolytes. Xavier convinces Exodus to disband the group and find a new way to help mutantkind, and Random, Amelia Voght, and Omega Sentinel decide to relocate to San Francisco in response to the X-Men's call for all mutants to relocate there.

Random is next seen on Utopia during Bastion's attack on the island. Random, along with Scalphunter, Sack, Litterbug, and others, is rallied to Utopia's defense by Cyclops, who declares, "Today you are all combatants. You are all X-Men".

Following the battle, Random attends Cable's funeral. When Cyclops puts together a squad of X-Men led by Rogue and Magneto to help with reconstruction efforts in San Francisco, Random is included in the group, along with Colossus, Psylocke, Omega Sentinel, Danger, Hellion, and Hope.

Random later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside Elixir, Karma, Masque, Madison Jeffries, and Tabitha Smith.

House of X
Random later appears as one of the villainous mutants invited to come live on the newly created mutant island of Krakoa, provided he no longer holds any grudges towards his fellow mutants.

Powers and abilities
Random's body is made of morphing protoplasm which can change into almost any shape he can imagine and commonly changes his forearms into weapons that fire hardened protoplasm projectiles from his own biomatter. He is able to randomly counteract any force or mutant ability directed at him, alter his mass and strength and rapidly regenerate damaged or detached/severed biomatter and limbs.

Reception
 In 2014, Entertainment Weekly ranked Random 91st in their "Let's rank every X-Man ever" list.

In other media

Television
 Random made non-speaking cameo appearances in X-Men: The Animated Series. In "Sanctuary", Random is shown amongst the mutants that reside on Asteroid M. In "Secrets Not Long Buried", Random is one of the many mutant residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa.
Calf Sound is a body of water which separates the Calf of Man island from the mainland of the Isle of Man. The sound - technically a strait - is about 700 yards in width, and contains the small islet of Kitterland, which is home to a large colony of seals.

The name ‘calf’ comes from the Old Norse word ‘kalfr’ which means a small island close to a larger one.

A visitor centre overlooking the Calf Sound holds multimedia exhibits giving information about the wildlife and history of the area. The centre, operated by Manx National Heritage also includes a café with both indoor and outdoor seating. The building erected to house the visitor centre was designed to have little visual impact when looking towards the Calf of Man, partially achieved by covering the roof with turf.

There is car parking available and an hourly bus service from Port Erin terminates here.
This is a list of mayors, or persons holding the equivalent office, of Mobile, Alabama, United States.

When Mobile came into the United States, it operated under a government system where the chief executive was called "President"

Presidents of Mobile

Mayors of Mobile

List of Mayors of Mobile between 1911 and 1985 (President of the City Commission)

From 1911 to 1985, Mobile was governed by a three-member city commission.  The office of Mayor of Mobile rotated between the members of the commission and was the title given to the President of the Commission.  The last directly elected mayor before the institution of the commission was Patrick J. Lyons.  He was the 40th mayor of Mobile.  Lyons would go on to be elected to the City Commission where he would serve as mayor several more times.  After several commissioners had faced corruption indictments and popular support grew for discarding the old commission system, Mobile restored direct elections in 1985, electing Arthur Outlaw as their first directly elected mayor since 1911.  The numbers listed correspond to their order within the overall list of the mayors of Mobile, not their order in presiding over the commission.

Chiefs of Staff to the Mayor
Timothy Farragut "Tim" McGee is a fictional character from the CBS television series NCIS. He is portrayed by Sean Murray. McGee specializes in cybersecurity and computer crime, and is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and MIT.

Murray appeared as a guest star in eight episodes of the first season of NCIS; in season two he joined the main cast and was added to the opening credits. In season twenty, Murray became the show's new main lead.

Background
McGee was born in Bethesda, Maryland, on September 13, 1978, to an Irish American family. He spent his childhood in Alameda, California, as his father was a naval officer stationed there. His parents bought him his first car—a 1984 Camaro Z28 5-speed—the day he turned sixteen. However, he crashed into a bus while trying to figure out how to use the windshield wipers. He got a student pass the day he got out of traction. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University and a Master of Science degree in computer forensics from MIT. His college GPA was 3.9, as he failed a fencing class in his sophomore year. He worked at the NCIS field office in Norfolk, Virginia, before being transferred to the headquarters in the Washington Navy Yard, a move made permanent at the end of the season two episode "See No Evil."

McGee has a younger sister, Sarah, who is played by Troian Bellisario (Murray's stepsister in real life). Sarah attends Waverly College and intends to be a writer like her older brother.

Development

Characterization
Special Agent Timothy McGee, commonly referred to by Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo as "Probie", "McGeek", "McQueen", "McGoo", "Probie wan kenobi", "McProbie", "Baldy McBald", "McDigit", "Timmy MaGee", and even "Elf Lord", is part of a major case squad led by Special Agent Gibbs. He gained his field agent status when he was transferred to Washington from Norfolk.

In addition to responding to crime scenes and conducting investigations (along with the rest of the field team), McGee also serves as Gibbs' computer consultant and frequently assisted Abby Sciuto in the forensics lab when necessary.

During the first few seasons, McGee was portrayed as timid and inexperienced. In the Season 3 episode "Probie", he was visibly shaken after killing his first suspect, even though it was in self-defense and his teammates backed him in the subsequent investigation. When questioned about McGee's guilt, Gibbs commented that McGee "doesn't know how to lie". His character was almost entirely altered by episode 6.12 "Caged", evolving into a bolder and more assertive character.

Following Gibbs' brief retirement and Tony's subsequent promotion he becomes the senior field agent. He takes on the role very seriously, gaining Tony's respect. Tony later stops calling him "Probie" and starts calling him "Tim". He is shown to be very protective of his younger sister, Sarah, especially when she shows up after apparently committing a murder. He hides the case from his team to protect her while simultaneously launching an investigation into the case in the episode "Twisted Sister".

Appearance 
Timothy McGee has green eyes and brownish-blond hair. He was overweight until the end of season 6; during the seventh season, he was shown to be losing weight. When DiNozzo pesters him about it, McGee replies that he has lost 15 pounds. McGee's weight loss led to speculation that Sean Murray, the actor who portrays McGee, was ill; in October 2010 Murray, via his Twitter account, explained that it was a deliberate weight loss via dieting, consuming only organic food and abstaining from alcohol and sugar. Murray has lost 25 pounds.

In his initial appearances, McGee always wore a suit, dress shirt and a necktie. From season 4, he stopped wearing neckties and adopted a slightly more open-collar look. From season 7, he began frequently wearing leather jackets and bomber jackets over his shirt. For the first 14 seasons, McGee had a clean-shaven appearance; during his time being held hostage in Paraguay between seasons 14 and 15, he grew a beard, which he has since kept since his return to NCIS.

Hobbies 
McGee has a passion for jet packs, computers and enjoys playing games relating to tactical warfare and covert infiltration. This is shown to be an interest shared by his sister Sarah in the episode "Red Cell", when she takes over his live war game as he leaves his apartment. In the episode "Broken Bird", his first computer was revealed to have been a Mac SE, followed by a PowerBook, and finally a PC. He uses a Logitech Y-SAE71-SK-2930 keyboard to carry out his everyday work.

In the episode "Ignition", he discusses his fascination with jet packs, even going so far as to show Gibbs a film he has made about them (produced under his pen name "Thom E. Gemcity", an anagram of Timothy McGee). Gibbs allows McGee to take the lead in the case because of this knowledge.

McGee is also shown to be an expert tracker, being able to find a cadaver without the assistance of dogs by reading changes in the land and observing bird droppings. He revealed he was a Scout, which occupied his time while his father was deployed. He even said "I love the outdoors", much to the chagrin of the more city-like DiNozzo. However, at least twice McGee has encountered poison ivy and suffered severe rashes.

Deep Six series 
In the episode "Dead Man Talking", it is revealed that McGee writes mystery/crime stories, and in the episode "Twisted Sister", it is revealed he has published a book entitled Deep Six. It became known in the episode "Cover Story" that McGee has been successful as a writer, and garnered a fanbase. It was kept a secret from the NCIS team for a long time. Under his pseudonym "Thom E. Gemcity" (an anagram of "Timothy McGee"), he has penned at least two novels as part of the Deep Six series, one published and one in progress. The title of the first book, Deep Six: The Continuing Adventures of L.J. Tibbs (whose name and character are based on Leroy Jethro Gibbs) suggests there have been previous novels, but these have yet to be named, though the cover of McGee's first revealed book states that it is volume one. The next of McGee's books to be released, and sequel to its predecessor is entitled Deep Six: Rock Hollow. Sean Murray commented, "As Thom E. Gemcity, he takes many liberties. I don't know if he knew the first book was going to be as successful as it was. But now he's got to run with it. I'm sure success has just increased his level of anxiety." In the episode "Cover Story", Rock Hollow becomes a focus point in that the NCIS team are investigating two murders (both committed because their killer thought they had robbed a convenience store and killed the clerk, as it was written in the book), when McGee is pressured to, and reveals everything that has taken place has been part of the book he is currently writing. It is then discovered that the story was stolen from the typewriter ribbon McGee threw away, and that Abby could be the next victim.

McGee's writing has given him enough fame to be feted as a minor celebrity and he can enjoy perks such as VIP clubbing, as seen in the episode "Friends and Lovers". McGee has ostensibly used the profits from his writing to purchase a Porsche Boxster (seen in the episode "Twisted Sister") and an Armani leather jacket (seen in the episode "Dead Man Walking"). He later mentions that he put the rest into a hedge fund, which crashed.

The characters in McGee's books are actually based on the characters in the NCIS team, with Leroy Jethro Gibbs as L.J. Tibbs, Anthony DiNozzo as Tommy, Ziva David as Lisa, Abby Sciuto as Amy Sutton, Jimmy Palmer as Pimmy Jalmer, and himself as McGregor. In the episode "Smoked", it is shown that in his novel Deep Six, McGee portrays "Tommy" and "Lisa" as lovers, "Pimmy" as a necrophiliac (a reference to Jimmy's job as Ducky's assistant in the autopsy room) and "Tibbs" as in love with a Lt. Col. (mirroring Gibbs' brief relationship with Lt Col Hollis Mann). Unimpressed, Tony and Ziva subject McGee to relentless teasing and tormenting for the rest of the episode. Jimmy especially disliked his portrayal and refuses to give McGee a ride back to NCIS headquarters.

Relationships

Romantic
In season 1, in "Sub Rosa", McGee went out on a lunch date with Abigail "Abby" Sciuto.

In the Season 10 finale, McGee began dating Delilah Fielding (Margo Harshman), a Department of Defense "cryptologist in a dark office". In season 11, the team meets her while investigating a case. In the Season 11 episodes "Kill Chain" and "Double Back", Delilah is left badly injured in a missile attack at a black-tie event she and McGee are attending. While McGee is not seriously injured, Delilah is left permanently paralyzed due to shrapnel embedded in her spine, and she thereafter uses a wheelchair; McGee struggles to cope with the thought of her being injured. She soon recovers from the incident and continues to assist the NCIS team. In the episode "Page Not Found", McGee confides in Tony that he is planning to ask Delilah to move in with him; Delilah later reveals to Tony that she wants to take a job opening for a senior intelligence analyst, which would require her to move to Dubai for a year. Tony then separately tells the two about their other half's plans; McGee encourages her to take the job and they agree to continue their relationship, albeit long-distance. McGee also gives her a copy of his house key, which she accepts, reiterating her intent to move in with him after her assignment is over.

Delilah returns to Washington in season 12 and they resume their relationship. He proposes to her in the episode "Love Boat", which she happily accepts. They are (unofficially) married in "Something Blue" shortly after finding out that they are expecting. In "Voices", McGee learns that Delilah is having twins, a boy and a girl, and in the next episode, she gives birth to John "Johnny" McGee, named after Tim's father, and Morgan McGee, named after a former cop turned security guard who died saving Tim's life.

Field team
As the junior field agent of the team, McGee is often subject to teasing from DiNozzo and Kate and Ziva, often together (though Kate and Ziva's teasing is not as mean-spirited as DiNozzo's), and, to some extent, Gibbs, though he doesn't come to head-smack him until later, unlike Kate and DiNozzo, who do so simultaneously on the day of his promotion almost immediately after Tim mentioned the word 'hazing'. In one episode, Gibbs walked into the lab, found him lying on the floor on his back while working on the underside of Abby's hotbox, and quipped, "Special Agent Goodwrench?" In "Forced Entry", he is tricked by Tony and Kate into drinking Gibbs' coffee, which is considered a major taboo. In subsequent episodes, Tony often pulls his seniority card by taking advantage of McGee's naivete and tricking him into performing less desirable tasks such as searching for a gun in a muddy ditch with only a metal detector and bagging bear poo while investigating a bear attack, brushing off McGee's protests with "because I can". In "Singled Out", a frustrated McGee futilely tells Tony to stop calling him "probie"; Gibbs later tells McGee that his former mentor Mike Franks still calls him "probie" even though he retired nearly a decade ago. McGee's most notable nicknames come from DiNozzo, either "Probie", due to his junior (probational) status on the team, or "McGeek", alluding to McGee's intelligence. DiNozzo uses multiple variations on both of these names to make fun of McGee, some of which are clever but not demeaning (McGPS, McProof, The Great McOz), some which are mocking (McLawyer, McGiggle, McGoo, McNerd, McFlowerPower), some of which seem irrelevant (McTim), and some intended to deliberately cause offense (Baldy McBald). When Tony discovers that McGee's online gaming name was "Elf Lord", it is often referenced by the team members through jokes and light-hearted teasing; Gibbs has occasionally called him Elf Lord in Season 5.

As with most new agents who had experience with Gibbs, McGee finds him difficult to work with due to his unorthodox management style and unpredictable temperament, with Tony constantly giving him tips on how to get along with Gibbs. Initially he is intimidated by Gibbs, especially after incurring his wrath having accidentally drunk or spilled his coffee several times during his earlier seasons. Gibbs himself is shown to gain more respect of McGee over time, as his personality matures and he becomes a more assertive character. Gibbs has also shown substantial trust and faith in his abilities over the course of time. In the episode "Witness", Gibbs sent McGee to check out a possible murder of a Navy Petty Officer and let him decide whether to call an investigation. He let McGee accompany him into the interrogation room while still a "probie" and allows him interrogate a suspect alone as early as the Season 3 episode "Deception". McGee is always shown as a computer consultant to Gibbs.

Ziva has had a friendly relationship with McGee since her start at NCIS. It resembles one of brother and sister. While Ziva teases McGee a great deal, often with Tony, they remain on friendly terms (Ziva's teasing is far more playful than Tony's, who takes a much more sadistic approach to the pranks he pulls on McGee). McGee was the first person to point out that Ziva was avoiding Tony at the start of season 7 and that sooner or later she would have to straighten out that relationship. He is much more comfortable and confident around Ziva than her predecessor, Kate Todd.

McGee lives near Ziva, in Silver Spring (a Maryland suburb of DC). When Ziva was in Israel between seasons 5 and 6, she and McGee e-mailed each other once a week. McGee has been to Ziva's house at least once, he was invited to her dinner party in season 3. McGee was also the one to show Ziva some ways to work from the area they live, and in return she gave him an apple – which Tony immediately stole before McGee was aware of the gift. Throughout season 7 as Ziva prepares to become an American citizen McGee supports her, even testing her, and attends her naturalization ceremony.

When McGee was introduced in "Sub Rosa", Todd protested DiNozzo's apparent abuse of authority when he ordered McGee to stay on a crime scene until someone else can come to relieve him. Todd and McGee were partnered for a very short time during the episode "UnSEALed", during which he came to her aid when she was tied up by a former Navy SEAL.

Throughout Season 2, DiNozzo and Todd would sometimes gang up on McGee to tease him, but Todd generally disapproved of DiNozzo's pranks and hazing of McGee. After the murder of a witness under McGee's watch, Todd was the first to try to comfort him.

In the episode "See No Evil", the air conditioning of the building is down. McGee tries to personally upgrade the network wiring since the union won't do it due to the heat. When Kate discovers him under her desk, she believes McGee is trying to look up her skirt and despite McGee's protests, drags him up from underneath by his ears. Seconds later, McGee tells Tony he didn't look and Tony says he believes him, only for him to ask if Kate is a "pantyhose or a thong girl" but McGee doesn't reply as Kate responds by elbowing DiNozzo in the stomach.

After Todd's death, like the rest of the grief-stricken team, McGee had to cope with the loss of a friend, and like DiNozzo, would fantasize about her. Later, McGee is shown mourning with DiNozzo over Todd's dead body.

Following Gibbs' retirement, McGee is promoted to Senior Field Agent after DiNozzo was promoted to Team Leader, after which Tony displays increased respect for McGee. With Ziva's departure in the episode "Aliyah", McGee is promoted to be Tony's partner in the field, and their relationship in the episode "Truth or Consequences" is shown to be friendly. For example, Tony used McGee's first name, Tim, more often and hasn't called him 'Probie' since season seven began. He is shown on friendly, even familial, terms with every member of the team.

In "Probie", McGee, who was deeply shaken after killing someone (later revealed to be an undercover policeman) in self-defense, later confesses to Tony feelings of inferiority to the rest of the team as he is the only field agent on Gibbs' team to have little experience in using weapons compared to his colleagues (Tony was a cop, Gibbs was a sniper, Kate was previously in the Secret Service while Ziva was a highly skilled Mossad operative).

In Season 11, with the transfer of Ellie Bishop from NSA to NCIS, McGee has begun to assert to seniority. He used some of Tony's old pranks on Bishop, such using a trick coin when tossing to see who has to retrieve a corpse from a septic tank.

In the Season 13 finale episode, "Family First", with DiNozzo having resigned from the team for good, McGee is promoted to Senior Field Agent and becomes the show's main character.

Abby Sciuto
McGee had an extended relationship with forensics technician Abby Sciuto in season one, but there is no direct reference to their relationship ending. However, despite this, they are still very close and often tease each other about their previous relationship/dates (sexual jokes, suggestive comments, etc.), and in some instances Abby has shown jealousy of attention women have given McGee. In contrast to Tony DiNozzo, McGee has had few relationships, or possible ones, almost all of which have begun and ended in the same episode.

In "Sub Rosa", McGee's first appearance in Season 1, McGee asks Tony about Abby. Tony responds that she is not his type, stating that as he has never had the urge to tattoo his butt, they would have little in common. At the end of the episode, McGee tells Tony that he went to get the word 'Mom' tattooed on his butt to impress Abby.

In Season 5 McGee has issues with a girl who stole his heart and his credit, when he asks for help from Abby she tells him "I love you McGee and that should be enough".

When in stressful or uncomfortable situations, as seen in the episode "Grace Period", while trying to deal with the death of a friend, McGee will often retreat to the forensics lab for reassurance from Abby.

McGee owns a dog called Jethro, that was accused of murdering a Petty Officer during the Season 5 episode, "Dog Tags". Abby looked after him and named him after Gibbs, but because her landlord wouldn't let her have a dog in her apartment, she forced McGee to take him.

Aside from Gibbs' basement, McGee's home has been shown in the most episodes of all the series' characters. Various characters have been inside at one point or another; namely Tony DiNozzo, Ziva David, Caitlin Todd, Sarah McGee, Abby Sciuto and Abby's previous boyfriend/stalker, Mikel.

In the Season 9 episode, "Life Before His Eyes" Abby and McGee are shown as a happy couple in the alternate reality scenarios.

Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard
Ducky is one of the few individuals to use McGee's full given name of Timothy as illustrated in "See No Evil". As with Abby, Ducky at times adopts a fatherly attitude towards Tim as demonstrated in the season four episode "Smoked". Ducky's fatherly relationship with McGee mellows into one of mutual respect.

Director Vance
In the episode "Collateral Damage" a discussion occurred between Gibbs and Director Vance about the ideal qualities an NCIS agent should possess. Director Vance told Gibbs that in his view, McGee exemplified the model NCIS agent, in sharp contrast to Gibbs who prefers agents in the mold of DiNozzo. During "Enemies Domestic", McGee seemed pretty shaken-up and almost distraught after seeing the extent of Vance's injuries following the explosion.

Family
Several members of McGee's family have appeared in the series over the years. His younger sister, Sarah, first mentioned in the Season 2 episode, "See No Evil", plays a prominent role in the fourth season episode "Twisted Sister". The two differ greatly in personality but are still very close. McGee helps clear Sarah as a potential murder suspect and is willing to risk his NCIS career to do so. Sarah McGee is portrayed by Troian Bellisario, Murray's real-life step-sister, and daughter of series creator and former executive producer Donald P. Bellisario.

In "Hide and Seek", it is revealed that McGee's father is a naval officer, and stationed in California. In "The Penelope Papers", it is revealed that McGee's maternal grandmother, Penelope Langston (played by Lily Tomlin) is still alive and was close to McGee when he was young. While talking to Penelope, McGee reveals that he and his father have not spoken in seven years; Penelope and McGee agree that McGee's father is like Gibbs, in that both love McGee, but have difficulty expressing their affection. The casting of Jamey Sheridan as McGee's father was announced in February 2013. The role was described as "complex and layered" by executive producer Gary Glasberg, and in the late March episode "Squall", Sheridan appeared as Admiral John McGee. The admiral is initially considered as a prime suspect; only to reveal that he has been sick for a while and tried to keep it quiet. Tony has described McGee's family situation as akin to the film The Great Santini – a "military brat" brought up in a strict household. In "The Penelope Papers" and several other episodes, the admiral admitted to Tim his regret in not spending as much time as he should have with his family. McGee's father passes on in Season 12.

Notable episodes

Some episodes provides particular insights into the McGee character:

 "Ready or Not": During a hostage situation in the hospital that NCIS and McGee end up in unexpectedly, Delilah gives birth to twins, John (a boy), named after McGee's father Admiral John McGee and Morgan (a girl), named after ER Guard (and former Law Enforcement Officer) Morgan Cade who was shot trying to help McGee arrest an Arms Dealer the team was hunting and later died of his wounds; McGee is unharmed and eventually is able to be with Delilah when she gives birth.
 "Once Upon a Tim": McGee's high school password is found on the notepad that was on a murder victim. In order to investigate, McGee must revisit his old high school memories, especially his relationship with a girl named Chloe.

Reception
The character's portrayal and Murray's performance were well received by critics who praised the character's growth throughout the show's run. MaGee's seeming inexperience in the field during early seasons was noted by critics, with Bill Keveney of USA Today describing him as "a wet-behind-the-ears computer expert" in 2005. A few months later, Noel Holston from Sun Sentinel styled McGee as the "newer, nerdier agent" of the group. In 2007, television historian Tim Brooks described him as "the earnest, conservative probationary agent with invaluable computer skills who was often the victim of Tony's pranks".

The Daily News referred to McGee as "the requisite tech wizard" of the show. Alyssa Rosenberg from The Washington Monthly suggested that the characters of McGee, "an MIT-educated geek who writes thinly veiled novels about the team", and Abby Sciuto appear as "liberal stand-ins" in contrast to more conservative figures on NCIS, such as Gibbs and Tony DiNozzo. None of the characters' political views are specified within the series, and Rosenberg stated that, as a result, the show does not "demand that the audience take sides in divisive issues".
John William Michael Field (born 15 May 1962) is an Australian composer and songwriter. He was a founding mainstay member of the Sydney pub rock band the Cockroaches on rhythm guitar and sharing lead vocals. He has written tracks for the children's music group, the Wiggles, including "Hot Potato". His brothers, Paul Field (later the Wiggles managing director) and Anthony Field (the blue Wiggle), were also bandmates in the Cockroaches.

Early life and education
John William Michael Field was born on 15 May 1962 in Darlinghurst and grew up in north-western Sydney as one of seven children. Their father, John Patrick Field (1932–98), was a suburban chemist. Their mother, Marie, made sure that they all learned how to play at least one musical instrument. Field attended an all-boys boarding school, St. Joseph's College, alongside his older brother, Paul, and younger brother, Anthony. Field was selected as the Under-19 New South Wales Cricketer of the Year. Anthony has declared that John would have been a professional cricketer if it were not for his success in music.

Career

The Cockroaches and other music projects

In 1979 John Field, on rhythm guitar and co-lead vocals, formed an Australian rock, R&B and pop music band, the Cockroaches, alongside Paul on co-lead vocals, Anthony on co-lead vocals and guitar, Jeff Fatt on keyboards, Tony Henry on drums and Phil Robinson on bass guitar. As a member of the Cockroaches, Field was recorded on their four studio albums, The Cockroaches (1987), Fingertips (1988), Positive (1991) and St. Patrick's Day 10am (1994), before they disbanded in 1994.

Early in 1991 Anthony and Fatt had left the Cockroaches to form the Wiggles, a children's music group, with Murray Cook, Greg Page and Phillip Wilcher. Field helped write much of their music.

In 1992 Field was a member of the Honeymen, alongside Sean Sennett. The duo released two singles, "Felt Like a Kiss" and "Motorbike of Love". Field has been in other live bands including The Alligators and The Oomph. His own group, the John Field Band, performs at parties and corporate functions. The John Field Band released two albums, a self-titled debut and Night Will Fall (December 2007).

Field wrote, composed and directed a musical theatre production, Evie and the Birdman (July 2001), which originally starred Sam Moran. Field created another musical, Who Loves Me?.

Field has also written commercial jingles, including one for Parklea Markets. In 2011 Field and Paul formed the Field Brothers, they issued a country music album, 1964. In 2014 Field issued a solo album, Bubba, mumma needs sleep: soothing music for babies and parents.

Personal life
John Field is married to Jacqueline Fallon, who choreographed Evie and the Birdman. The couple have four children. Field has a degree in education and, with his family, resides in Sydney. In May 2008, Field was diagnosed with Dupuytren's contracture and sought treatment.
Charles Reginald Jackson (April 6, 1903September 21, 1968) was an American writer. He wrote the 1944 novel The Lost Weekend.

Early life
Charles R. Jackson was born in Summit, New Jersey on April 6, 1903, the son of Frederick George and Sarah Williams Jackson.  His family moved to Newark, New York in 1907, and nine years later his older sister, Thelma, and younger brother, Richard, were killed while riding in a car that was struck by an express train.  He graduated from Newark High School in 1921.  He attended Syracuse University, joining a fraternity there, but left during his freshman year after a "furtive sexual encounter with a fellow member of his fraternity, who then spread word of the incident in such a way that only Jackson came in for public disgrace"; a fictionalized version of that experience was later incorporated into The Lost Weekend.

As a young man he worked as an editor for local newspapers and in various bookstores in Chicago and New York prior to falling ill with tuberculosis.  From 1927 to 1931, Jackson was confined to sanatoriums and eventually recovered in Davos, Switzerland.  His battle with tuberculosis cost him a lung and served as a catalyst for his alcoholism.

Career
He returned to New York at the height of the Great Depression and his difficulty in finding work spurred on his binge drinking.  His battle to stop drinking started in late 1936 and was largely won by 1938. On March 4, 1938, Jackson married magazine writer Rhoda Booth. They later had two daughters, Sarah (born 1940) and Kate (born 1943).

During this time he was a free-lance writer and wrote radio scripts. Jackson's first published story, "Palm Sunday", appeared in the Partisan Review in 1939. It focused on the debauched organist of a church the narrators attended as children.

In the 1940s, Jackson wrote a trio of novels, beginning with The Lost Weekend published by Farrar & Rinehart in 1944. The autobiographical novel chronicled a struggling writer's five-day drinking binge. It earned Jackson lasting recognition.  While working on The Lost Weekend, Jackson earned as much as $1000 per week writing scripts for the radio soap opera Sweet River, about a widowed minister and his two sons.

In 1945, Paramount Pictures paid $35,000 for the rights to adapt The Lost Weekend into the a film version of the same name. The Academy Award winning film was directed by Billy Wilder and starred Ray Milland in the lead role of Don Birnam. At the height of his career, Charles R. Jackson lectured at various colleges.

Jackson's second published novel of the 1940s, titled The Fall of Valor, was released in 1946 and takes its name from a passage in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Set in 1943, it detailed a professor's obsession with a young, handsome Marine.  The Fall of Valor received mixed reviews, and, though sales were respectable, was considerably less successful than Jackson's famous first novel. Jackson's The Outer Edges was released in 1948 and dealt with the gruesome rape and murder of two girls in Westchester County, New York. The Outer Edges also received mixed reviews, and sales were poor relative to his previous novels. Jackson's later works included two collections of short stories, The Sunnier Side: Twelve Arcadian Tales (1950) and Earthly Creatures (1953).

Later years
Throughout his career, Jackson continued to struggle with an addiction to alcohol and pills. Over the years, he underwent psychoanalysis to help him kick his addictions. After the success of The Lost Weekend, Jackson began taking pills (mainly the sedative Seconal) and drinking again. He later told his wife that unless he was under the influence of Seconal, he would suffer from writer's block and become depressed.

In September 1952, he attempted suicide and was committed to Bellevue Hospital. He was readmitted four months later after suffering a nervous breakdown. After his release, he went on an alcohol and paraldehyde binge during which he wrote six short stories and began writing A Second-Hand Life. In 1953, he checked into an alcoholism clinic and joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Jackson later also spoke about alcoholism to large groups, sharing his experience. A recording of his talk in Cleveland, Ohio in May 1959 is still distributed in the AA community. He was the first speaker in Alcoholics Anonymous to address drug dependence (barbiturates and paraldehyde) openly as part of his story.

By the mid-1950s, Jackson was sober but was no longer writing. As a result, he and his family began struggling financially. He and his wife had to sell their New Hampshire home and eventually moved to Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Jackson's wife got a job at the Yale Center of Alcohol Studies while Jackson moved to New York City, where he rented an apartment at The Dakota. He continued to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and attempted to begin writing again. In the early 1960s, three of his short stories appeared in McCall's magazine but Jackson still struggled with periodic bouts of writer's block. He later worked as a story editor for the anthology television series Kraft Television Theatre and got a job teaching writing at Rutgers University.

A long-time heavy smoker, Jackson suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Towards the end of his life, he was admitted to the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital in Saranac Lake, New York after a relapse of tuberculosis. After his release, Macmillan Publishers gave him an advance for a new book. Jackson moved to the Hotel Chelsea and resumed work on A Second-Hand Life, a novel that he began writing some 15 years earlier. Upon its release, the book received mediocre reviews but sold well.

Death
On September 21, 1968, Jackson died of barbiturate poisoning at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City. His death was ruled a suicide. At the time of his death, Jackson was working on a sequel to The Lost Weekend entitled Farther and Wider.

Jackson had relapsed into alcoholism during the months before his death, and had become estranged from his family. Jackson had been closeted for the greater part of his life and, in his later years, attempted to come to terms with his bisexuality. Jackson identified as bisexual late in life and began living with his male lover in 1965.
The L&YR Class 21 is a class of small 0-4-0ST steam locomotive built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway for shunting duties. They were nicknamed Pugs.

Construction history 
The class originates in the purchase of three saddle tank locomotives ordered from Vulcan Foundry in 1886. They were fitted with an  long,  diameter boiler with a pressure of  powering two outside  cylinders connected to  driving wheels. The wheelbase was  and the total heating surface of the saturated boiler was .

J. A. F. Aspinall then ordered more locomotives of a modified design: the wheelbase was shortened to , the tank was extended over the smokebox, the cab was enlarged,  and the boiler pressure raised to . Seventeen of this modified design were ordered from Horwich Works in three batches; Aspinall's successor Henry Hoy order another batch of 10; and Hoy's successor George Hughes ordered 30 more in two batches.

The last locomotive was delivered in July 1910, four months before the first retirement; 917 and 918 were withdrawn in November that year, but were not scrapped until November 1912.

Operational history 

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) gave the locomotives the power classification 0F. In total sixty were made between 1886 and 1910. They were built for use in sharply curved sidings for shunting duties. The Pugs were allocated by the L&YR for operation in the industrial areas and docks of Fleetwood, Goole, Liverpool and Salford. In later times they became more widely dispersed, reaching places such as Bristol, Bangor, Crewe, Derby, Widnes, York and Swansea. When the LMS was merged into British Railways on 1 January 1948, 23 'Pugs' remained in service; BR added 40,000 to their fleet numbers.

Withdrawal 
Withdrawals started in 1910 with two going in that year. Four went in the 1920s, 31 in the 1930s; leaving 23 to be withdrawn between 1957 and 1964.

Accidents and incidents
On 5 July 1963, one of the driving wheels of locomotive No. 51232 sheared off at , Lancashire.

Preservation 

Two "Pugs" have survived into preservation, both through the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Trust.
L&YR No. 19 (LMS No. 11243), built in 1910, was sold by the LMS into industry in 1931 and was acquired by the Trust from the United Glass Bottle Manufacturers Ltd. at Charlton in 1967. It was found to be in poor mechanical condition and was later placed on static display pending overhaul, most recently at the Ribble Steam Railway. In early 2020 the locomotive moved to the East Lancashire Railway in Bury. Following an inspection of its condition, it was decided to proceed with restoring it to working order. This restoration is now in progress.

L&YR No. 68 (LMS No. 11218, BR No. 51218), built in 1901, was purchased directly from British Rail in 1964 and moved to the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway in January 1965. The locomotive was re-tubed in 1974 and took part in the Stockton & Darlington Railway cavalcade that year. The locomotive was overhauled again in 1997 and continued in service, albeit mostly as a shunting locomotive due to its low power, until its boiler tubes required replacement in 2006. The locomotive carried its original identity of L&YR 68 from 2004 onwards, but has been cosmetically restored in 2018 to 51218 for the K&WVR's 50th Anniversary Gala, reflecting that 51218 was the first loco to arrive in 1965. Overhaul is now under consideration at Haworth on the K&WVR as the restoration of 0-6-0ST No. 752 has now been completed at the East Lancashire Railway.

Models 

Several models of the 'Pug' have been produced commercially.

The first was a 'OO'-scale polystyrene kit made in the 1960s by Kitmaster, the moulds for which were subsequently sold to Airfix then passed on to Dapol, which still manufactures the former Airfix plastic kit range. This kit has often been used as the basis for a narrow-gauge 'pug bash' locomotive running on 00-9 tracks.

A ready-to-run OO model was produced initially by Dapol and then Hornby where the Pug was produced until 2000. The Pug was reintroduced to Hornby's range in 2010 (R2927) in early British Railways Livery. It was also made in 2019 in the LMS livery.

Larger scale models are available from a number of suppliers including Tower Models of Blackpool.
Murdochville is a town in Quebec, Canada, one of only a few inland communities on the Gaspé Peninsula.  Its population (as of 2016) is 651.

Murdochville is located along Quebec Route 198 in the geographic township of Holland,  south of L'Anse-Pleureuse and  west of Gaspé. It is  above sea level and surrounded by high mountains.

History

In 1921, copper ore was discovered in the area by the Miller brothers: Alfred, Sydney, Frederick, Angus and Theophilus. However, it was not until 1950 that Noranda Mines actually began mining. The mining town was set up and named after James Y. Murdoch, owner of the mine and first president of Noranda. In 1953, the town was incorporated.

The mining operation in the town was comparatively large, starting with mining the raw ore and finishing with an end product of pure copper anode. In the 1970s, the mining operation in Murdochville was large enough to support a population of 5,000 inhabitants. A number of large union battles in Murdochville also helped lay the groundwork for ideas that still exist today. The 1957 Murdochville strike led to the adoption of several new laws protecting the rights of unionized workers in Quebec.

In 1987, the mine was partially destroyed by an underground fire, and mining only resumed two years later.

The mine closed in 1999, leaving the town to fight for survival. After several close calls, the small town has decided to fight back, in an effort to reverse the economic uncertainty that has befallen the town. This has included the creation of several large wind turbine projects, along with the diversification of the local economy, with emphasis on tourism (such as skiing in the winter months).

Demographics 

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Murdochville had a population of  living in  of its  total private dwellings, a change of  from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of  in 2021.

Climate
Murdochville has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb). Summers are relatively cool and short, whereas winters are long and at times very cold with massive amounts of snowfall. The brief summers are, however, mild enough to keep September (the fourth-warmest month) right above the  isotherm for a humid continental climate.
Patrick John Hayes FAAAI (born 21 August 1944) is a British computer scientist who lives and works in the United States. , he is a senior research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, Florida.

Education
Hayes was educated at the Bentley Grammar School, Calne. He studied the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in artificial intelligence on the topic of 'Semantic trees: New foundations for automatic theorem-proving'  from the University of Edinburgh.

Career and research
Hayes has been an active, prolific, and influential figure in artificial intelligence for over five decades. He has a reputation for being provocative but also quite humorous. 

One of his earliest publications, with John McCarthy, was the first thorough statement of the basis for the AI field of logical knowledge representation, introducing the notion of situation calculus, representation and reasoning about time, fluents, and the use of logic for representing knowledge in a computer.

Hayes next major contribution was the seminal work on the Naive Physics Manifesto, which anticipated the expert systems movement in many ways 
and called for researchers in AI to actually try to represent knowledge in computers. Although not the first to mention the word "ontology" in computer science (that distinction belongs to John McCarthy), Hayes was one of the first to actually do it, and inspired an entire generation of researchers in knowledge engineering, logical formalisations of commonsense reasoning, and ontology.

In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument "disproving" the possibility of AI. The Newcomb Awards are announced in the AI Magazine published by AAAI.

At the turn of the century he became active in the Semantic Web community, contributing substantially (perhaps solely) to the revised semantics of RDF known as RDF-Core, one of the three designers (along with Peter Patel-Schneider and Ian Horrocks) of the Web Ontology Language semantics, and most recently contributed to SPARQL.  He is also, along with philosopher Christopher Menzel the primary designer of the ISO Common Logic standard.

Hayes has served as secretary of AISB, chairman and trustee of IJCAI, associate editor of Artificial Intelligence, a governor of the Cognitive Science Society and president of American Association for Artificial Intelligence. Hayes is a charter Fellow of AAAI and of the Cognitive Science Society

According to his website, his current research interests include "knowledge representation and automatic reasoning, especially the representation of space and time; the semantic web; ontology design; and the philosophical foundations of AI and computer science".

Alexander "Sasha" Viktorovich Abt (born October 22, 1976) is a Russian figure skater and coach. He is a two-time European medalist and placed fifth at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Career
Abt's first experience with figure skating came at the age of six when his grandmother took him to a rink. Sergei Volkov coached him early on but he began suffering from cancer and sent Abt to be trained by Rafael Arutyunyan before he died. Soon after, Abt began to make a name for himself on the junior circuit and won the silver medal at the 1991 World Junior Championships.

Abt underwent surgery for a knee problem early in his career. Later, in the summer of 1996, he sustained a serious injury during an exhibition performance in Mexico – He crashed into the boards and cut into his right leg's quadriceps muscle with his left blade, keeping him in hospital for several weeks and off ice for six months. He was a late replacement at the 1997 European Championships, where he won the bronze medal.

Alexander placed fourth at the 1998 Russian Championships and was not named to the Olympic team. Later that year, he placed third at the European Championships, behind fellow countrymen Alexei Yagudin and Evgeni Plushenko and claimed the bronze medal. Abt underwent knee surgery in December 1998.

Abt had a sinus infection at the 2001 European Championships and underwent surgery in spring 2001 to remove a cyst from his sinuses. In June 2001, he moved to Lake Arrowhead, California, for training. Abt won the silver medal at the 2002 European Championships, and came in fifth at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Abt intended to retire following that season, but instead elected to continue competing. Having worked with Arutyunyan for eleven years, Abt decided to move to a new coach, Alexander Zhulin, in May 2002.

Abt won three Grand Prix medals, as well as his first (and only) Russian Championship in the 2002-03 season. He was forced to withdraw from the 2003 European Championships after injuring his landing ankle in practice a day before he was supposed to fly out, and took several months to recover. His last competition was the 2004 Russian Championships. He withdrew after placing fourth in the short program.

Abt retired from competition and participated in the Russian TV show Ice Age (2008). He played one of the main roles in a Russian soap opera about figure skating, My Hot Ice (2008–2009). Abt has skated in Japan for Prince Ice World and in Russia on the Ice Symphony tour. He coaches in New Jersey.

Personal life
In April 1999, Abt married former ice dancer Elena Pavlova, who competed with her brother Alexander Pavlov. They have one son, Makar, born in March 2000. The family now resides in New Jersey, in the United States.

Basford is a hamlet and former civil parish, now in the parish of Weston and Crewe Green, in the unitary authority area of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England, lying immediately south of Crewe. Nearby villages include Shavington, Weston, Hough and Chorlton. The population was 256 in 2011. Basford was first recorded in the Domesday survey and had a moated manor. The modern parish is bisected by the A500 and the Crewe-to-Stafford railway line, and includes Basford Hall Sorting Sidings.

History
Tools and weapons made of flint have been discovered in the parish. Berchesford was a small manor at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086. The name is thought to mean either "ford near birch trees" or the ford associated with a personal name, such as Beorcal, Borkr or Barkr. Three separate manors are recorded, which probably represent Basford, Weston and Hough, held by Owine, Erlekin and Leofric. Basford Hall was formerly a moated manor; the building was lost to fire in around 1700, and the remains were covered by the railway development. Basford formerly had a railway station. The A500 bypass opened in 2003.

Onward Housing is developing a 450-home scheme in the parish.  123 properties are to be designated as affordable and the remainder for sale. This site is designated a strategic location for housing in the Cheshire East Local Plan, part of Cheshire East Council's plan for 850 homes in the village with a new local centre, including a primary school, shops and community centre, supported by a £2.2 million Homes England grant with investments of £4.5 million for road improvements, £1.5 million towards a new local primary school and £670,000 for new bus services, cycle lanes and pedestrian routes.

Governance
The civil parish is administered by Weston and Basford Parish Council, jointly with the adjacent larger parish of Weston. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the new unitary authority of Cheshire East. Basford falls in the parliamentary constituency of Crewe and Nantwich, and has been represented by Kieran Mullan since the 2019 General Election.

Basford was formerly a township in the parish of Wybunbury, from 1866 Basford was a civil parish in its own right.

Geography and transport

The civil parish has a total area of . The A500 runs east–west through the parish, and the Crewe-to-Stafford railway line runs north west to south east through it; there are currently no stations within Basford (as of 2020). To the north of the A500 is Basford Hall Sorting Sidings. Weston Lane runs east–west south of the A500, connecting Shavington and Weston. Back Lane and Casey Lane run south and south west, respectively, from Weston Lane to meet immediately north east of Hough, on the southern boundary of Basford parish. Casey Lane crosses the railway at Casey Bridge. The South Cheshire Way and the Crewe and Nantwich Circular Walk long-distance footpaths go through the south-east corner, crossing Basford Brook at a footbridge.

Most of the existing settlement in the parish lies to the south of the A500; large housing developments in the northern area were under consideration in late 2017. The hamlet of Basford lies along Weston Lane and at the junction with Back Lane.

The terrain is predominantly flat, sloping gently upwards from an elevation of around  in the north to  in the south. Swill Brook runs along part of the western boundary, Gresty Brook along part of the northern boundary, and Basford Brook along or just inside parts of the eastern boundary. Small areas of woodland are located near the eastern boundary, including Burrow Coppice and an unnamed woodland flanking Basford Brook. There are occasional ponds or meres scattered across the area.

Demography
According to the 2001 census Basford had a population of 266, reducing slightly to 256 in 115 households at the 2011 census. This is an increase on the 19th-century population; the historical figures are 55 (1801), 69 (1851), 77 (1881), 69 (1901) and 229 (1951).

Education

There are no educational facilities in Basford. The civil parish falls within the catchment area of Shavington Academy; the area to the west of the railway line falls in the catchment of Shavington Primary School, and that to the east, Weston Village Primary School.
Samuel Washington Woodhouse (June 27, 1821 – October 23, 1904) was an American surgeon, explorer and naturalist.

Woodhouse was doctor and naturalist on the Sitgreaves Expedition led by Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves from San Antonio to San Diego which explored the possibility of a route from the Zuni River to the Pacific. He was the author of A Naturalist in Indian Territory: The Journal of S. W. Woodhouse, 1849-50. Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii) and Woodhouse's scrub jay (Aphelocoma woodhouseii) were named in his honor. The first Cassin's sparrow was described in 1852 by Samuel W. Woodhouse from a specimen collected near San Antonio, Texas. Dr. Woodhouse gave it its species name in honor of John Cassin, a Philadelphia ornithologist.

Meadowdale competes 3A in the Washington Interscholastic Athletic Association after two years as 4A between 2004-2006.  The school's mascot is the Maverick, though prior to 2000 it was the "Chiefs". 1997-1998 were the years of the school's last major renovations.

The school's schedule is based on a 100-minute, 3-period block schedule, consisting of 1st, 3rd, and 5th periods on Monday and Wednesday and 2nd, 4th, and 6th periods on Tuesday and Thursday.  On Friday, students go to all six classes for roughly 50 minutes each.

Clubs and activities

Some of Meadowdale's clubs and activities include:

ASB
Meadowdale enjoys an active Associated Student Body (ASB), which organizes and carries out events, including community outreach projects. Of particular note is the canned food drive, which attempts to gather 100,000 cans of food. The ASB is organized with a group of six executive officers who run events and activities, and five Senators from each grade level, who are responsible for class events such as dances and the Senior Prom.  The ASB also works closely with the Interhigh association to sponsor district-wide events, such as a District Talent Show.

Music
Meadowdale offers band, orchestra, choir, and guitar electives. Meadowdale is especially renowned for its strong jazz program, which consists of two jazz bands, a 5-person jazz combo, and their vocal jazz ensemble, Impressions, which performs with the combo.

Drama
Meadowdale has a highly active drama club. Shows previously performed by the Meadowdale Players include 13 Past Midnight, Little Women, The Wedding Singer, Romeo and Juliet, Any Number Can Die, Once Upon a Mattress, 12 Angry Jurors, and Thoroughly Modern Millie. The Drama Club as well produces a show called the Miscast Cabret, which promotes Gender Equality by having guys sing songs traditionally sang by girls, and vice versa. They also have an annual festival of ten-minute plays every spring, which are written, directed, and performed by students.

SDoKBC
The Meadowdale student body is well known for its many connections to Kevin Bacon. The students have been inspired by the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, and it has become a popular past time of the students to find more connections to the actor. The smallest separation known as of March 30, 2017 is two degrees.

Athletics
Meadowdale supports a variety of sports teams, playing in the Wesco South 3A league.

Football
Meadowdale finished the 2007 season with a 7-5 record, making it to the state quarterfinals for the first time since 1959 before losing to O'Dea High School.

In 2008 the mavericks went 6-4 (3-1 division) in regular season as well as capturing the 3A Wesco Division Title (under the newly created Wesco 3A division) as well as making another run to the Washington State Playoffs. They lost in their second playoff game to Capital High School

In 2009 the Mavericks finished the regular season undefeated at 11-0.  The Mavericks beat Renton and Columbia River advancing to the state quarterfinals again. The Mavericks lost to Union High School 49-7.

In 2016, the Mavericks reached the state semifinals for the first time in school history, where they fell to O'Dea by a score of 35-9 at Pop Keeney Field in Bothell, WA.

Soccer

In 2004, the boys' soccer team won the 3A state title, beating Mt. Rainier 2-3 in extra time. The girls' soccer team made it to the 3A state competition in 2007 for the first time in six years but lost to Kennedy of Burien 0-0 in the first-round game.  Meadowdale's 2012 girls' soccer team is currently #1 in Washington State with a record of 10-0-0 as of October 11, 2012.

1981 Meadowdale High School Girls Soccer
The 1981 Meadowdale High girls soccer team was the first Snohomish County Class school to win a Washington state high school soccer championship, in fact, this championship match was the first ever Washington state soccer championship playoff for girls. This team placed third in its Class 4A Wesco league and was not expected to win the state title. But they did by beating the Hazen Highlanders 3-2 in a shootout in weather that was very rainy and windy. Roger Bray, an elementary school teacher, was the head coach and two of his daughters, Gayle and Leslie, were members of the team.

Basketball
Meadowdale enjoys successful boys' and girls' basketball programs. During the late 1990s and through the entire 2000's, both programs were a dominating presence in WESCO and a staple at the state tournament. 
The girls have two 3A state titles to their credit, winning in 2000 and 2004, as well as being runners up in 1994 and 1999. All four state championship appearances came under head coach Karen Blair, who was inducted into the Snohomish County Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.Snohomish_County_Sports_Hall_of_Fame_Award_Winners_2015
Before never making the state tournament in program history, the Lady Chiefs/Mavs made the state tournament 16 times in a 17-year span (from 92-93 until 08-09), and placed at state (top 8) 13 times. They have not returned to state since 2009.

The boys' basketball team went to state for the first time in 1978, and did not return again until the 2002-03 season. From 2002-2011 the Mavs made 5 state tournament appearances, including 3 trips to the semifinals. Despite a first round loss to #1 ranked Enumclaw in 2010, Meadowdale placed 5th at state, the highest in program history, and have not returned to the tournament since.

Meadowdale has a feeder program that develops 5th through 8th grade basketball players who will eventually attend the high school. The program describes itself as teaching the "Meadowdale Way" to boys and girls long before they reach high school.

Wrestling
When the Mavericks were known as the Chiefs, they won 3 individual state titles and also had a 6th-place finisher on their way to a team state title in the 83-84 season.  The Chiefs returned a strong team from the year prior and had 2 repeat individual state champions, a 3rd-place finisher, a 4th-place finisher and a 5th-place finisher to capture a back to back team state championship in the 84-85 season. The Chiefs stayed in the lime light with individual state champions in the 86-87 season, and the 89-90 season. The Mavericks won the inaugural Big Dog tournament and had JV wrestlers place in the Panther Classic at Snohomish High School. They also placed 2nd in the Lynnwood Classic in 2009. In 2013 they had a first place state champion and a fourth-place finisher. In 2014 they had a second-place finisher in the matt classic. And in 2015 they had a second and a third-place finisher in the matt classic.

Baseball
The baseball team at MHS has had its fair share of success. In 1980, under coach Ron Martin, the Chiefs defeated Shadle Park HS 8-4 for the school's first baseball state title. 10 years later, they added a second state championship with a 2-0 victory over Hanford. Meadowdale first appeared on the state tournament stage in 1974 and have made 16 trips to date.  Bill Hummel became the head coach in 2005 and in just his 3rd season (2007) as the Mavs' skipper, they advanced to the state semifinals at Safeco Field and took home the 4th-place trophy. The next season (2008) saw an identical result. Since then, MHS has made three additional state appearances with Coach Hummel at the helm, but have not advanced past the 2nd round.

Cheerleading
Currently competing in the 3A Non-Tumbling division, the Meadowdale Cheerleading Squad has taken home State Champion titles at the WIAA Cheerleading State Championships in 2005, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2016. They have previously competed in Co-ed and Tumbling divisions.

Buller's albatross (Thalassarche bulleri) or Buller's mollymawk, is a small mollymawk in the albatross family.

It breeds on islands around New Zealand, and feeds in the seas off Australia and the South Pacific.

Taxonomy
Mollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to the family Diomedeidae of the order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages called naricorns that attach to the upper bill, although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into seven to nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the large amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a highly saline solution from their nose.

In 1998, C.J.R. Robertson and G. B. Nunn split this species into two, Thalassarche (bulleri) bulleri, and Thalassarche (bulleri) platei, although the majority of authorities including ITIS, James Clements, BirdLife International, and Michael Brooke have not yet accepted this split

Etymology
It was named for the New Zealand ornithologist Walter Buller.

Description
Buller's albatross averages . It has a silver-grey forehead, a grey head and throat. It has a black patch around the eyes with a white crescent behind and below the eye.  Its back, upperwing, and tail are dark grey, and its rump and underparts are white. Its underwing is white with a black tip, with a broad sharply demarcated dark band at the leading edge. Its bill is large and black with yellow on the upper mandible, and the tip. The juvenile has a darker head and a brown bill.

Behaviour

Reproduction
The Buller's albatross is colonial, nesting generally on cliffs, steep coastal terraces, grassy meadows, and tussock covered hills. Birds in the Snares Islands also nest under trees inland. The nest is mound of soil, grass and roots and is set into depressions in the breeding area. Breeding begins in December. Eggs on the Snares are laid in late January (around the 21-23 of January).  incubation lasts around 60 days, with both parents sharing the responsibility. The average incubation shift is around 10 days. After hatching it takes 170 days to fledge the chick. They breed annually.

Feeding
Buller's albatross feeds on squid, fish, tunicates, octopus, and crustacea.

Range and habitat

Buller's albatross is endemic to New Zealand. They breed on Snares Islands, Solander Island, Chatham Islands (Big and Little Sister and Forty-fours Island), and Three Kings Islands (Rosemary Rock). Adults forage between 40°S and 50°S from Tasmania to the Chatham Rise.  Juveniles and adults that aren't breeding disperse across the South Pacific with a number feeding every year in the Humboldt Current off Chile and Peru.

Conservation

It was formerly classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. But new research has shown it to be not as rare as it was believed. Consequently, it was downlisted to near threatened status in 2008. It has an occurrence range of  and a breeding range of . According to a 1999 estimate, there are 64,000 birds and there are 31,939 breeding adults. These are located as follows: 8,877 pairs on the Snares Islands, 4,912 pairs on Solander Island, 16,000 pairs on Forty-fours Island, 2,130 pairs on Big and Little Sister, 20 pairs on Rosemary Rock in the Three Kings group.

The Snares Islands population has been increasing, but lately not as much as in the 1970s, whereas the Solander Island population which was stable from 1985 to 1996 has now shown about an 18% increase. The survival rate of adults on the Snares Islands increased to 95.5% and brooding success rate was 70.8%, whereas on Big and Little Sister, adult survival rate is 93.5% and the brooding success rate is between 57-60%.

Buller's albatross is the most common bycatch from longline fisheries out of New Zealand, and, even though net-sonde cables were banned in 1992, squid trawlers still catch them. Finally, weka Gallirallus australis was introduced to Big Sister and may take eggs and chicks. Most islands are legally protected, except for the Chatham Islands colonies which are on private land.

Adolph Ernst (April 7, 1887 – November 10, 1966), better known for his ring name Ad Santel, was a German-American professional wrestler, considered one of the greatest practitioners of catch wrestling. He was a World Light Heavyweight Champion for several years. Santel also billed himself as the World Judo Champion during his feud with the Kodokan judo school.

Career 
Ad Santel's professional wrestling career took him all throughout the world, wrestling some of the top wrestlers of the 1910s, '20s and '30s including Joe Stecher, Gus Sonnenberg, John Pesek and Dick Daviscourt, and reigning as World Light Heavyweight Champion for several years. In San Francisco in August 1921, Santel faced 290 lb Gobar Guha in a matched billed for the "World Wrestling Championship." Gobar beat Santel after an hour and three minutes of wrestling.

Rivalry with the Kodokan
Ad Santel fought one of the early clash-of-the-styles matches in modern martial arts history against Tokugoro Ito, a 5th degree black belt in judo from Japan. Fighting under judo rules, which he knew thanks to a previous match against jujutsu specialist Senryuken Noguchi, Santel defeated Ito when a slamming takedown rendered the judoka unable to continue, and then proclaimed himself the World Judo Champion. Tokugoro Ito went on to avenge the loss a few months later on June 10, 1916, by defeating Santel with a choke hold, becoming the first and last judoka to ever defeat Santel.

In October 1914, Santel came to Seattle and challenged resident judo master Taro Miyake, who Santel had already met in a draw. Santel won with such a powerful half nelson slam that Miyake remained dizzy for half an hour after the match. Seeing this as a new offense, judo founder Jigoro Kano sent 5th degree black belt Daisuke Sakai to avenge his defeat, but Santel again got over him, submitting Sakai twice with a biceps slicer.

As the Kodokan school did not send more challengers, Santel decided to travel to Japan to challenge them in their own ground. He assembled a team with fellow wrestlers Henry Weber and Manjiro "Matty" Matsuda, the latter being a judo black belt who had turned to catch wrestling years before. Their travel was possible thanks to Kodokan member Heita Okabe, who helped to host a series of matches between Santel's team and the Kodokan. Though Kano refused to sanction the event and threatened his students with expulsion if they fought, six of them accepted the challenge nonetheless, among them 5th degree black belts Hikoo Shoji and Reijiro Nakata. It was decided the bouts would be contested under neutral rules that demanded judogi jackets yet allowed all sorts of holds. In front of a crowd of 10.000 at the Yasukuni shrine, Santel defeated Nagata by TKO after a devastating headlock, and the next day he had a 60 minutes draw with Shoji, who left the mat so battered that Santel himself had to help him out of the arena. Later, Santel would defeat another judoka, Hitoshi Shimizu, to avenge Shimizu's victory over Weber.

The impact of these performances on Japan was immense. The Japanese were fascinated by the submissions taught in catch wrestling, and Japanese fighters traveled to Europe in order to either participate in various tournaments or to learn catch wrestling at European schools such as Billy Riley's school in Wigan, UK. Okabe and the judo challengers were effectively expelled from Kodokan, but some of them followed Santel to the United States to train with him, among them Hikoo Shoji, who became a freestyle wrestling pioneer in Japan.

In 1925, Santel faced a new judoka, this time Tsutao Higami, a 165-pound lighter but highly renowned groundwork expert who had trained under Ito and Miyake. The match had two falls as in professional wrestling and was refereed by judoka Hiroshi Kitayama. Santel won the first fall, scoring a takedown and transitioning into a neckscissors hold that choked Higami out. After being revived, Higami proceeded to win the second fall, going through a back and forth round and locking a juji-gatame which Kitayama called on his favor. With the two falls evenly scored, the match ended in a draw, although Higami decided to learn wrestling shortly after. In 1926, Santel would face Setsuzo Ota, drawing again.

Late career
Years after the famous 1911 match between Frank Gotch and Georg Hackenschmidt, Santel told Lou Thesz that he was paid $5,000 by Gotch's backers to cripple Hackenschmidt in training, and make it look like an accident. According to Hackenschmidt himself, the injury was accidentally inflicted by his sparring partner, Dr. Roller, when trying to hold Hackenschmidt down onto his knees and Roller's right foot striking Hackenschmidt's right knee; his sparring partners were Jacobus Koch, Wladek Zbyszko and Dr. Roller. Ad Santel is not mentioned in any account of Hackenschmidt's training by either Hackenschmidt or Roller, both of whom offered their insights and accounts. However, Ad Santel was Hackenschmidt's head trainer and sparring partner using his real name of Adolph Ernst for about a year prior and right up until the second Gotch match when he was replaced with Dr Roller. Ernst was listed in almost every newspaper story on Hackenschmidt in the months prior to the Gotch rematch. It's believed Hackenshmidt put out the Roller story in hopes of Gotch and Burns refusing to pay Santel.

Santel, along with George Tragos, Ray Steele and Ed Lewis, trained Lou Thesz in the art of catch wrestling. Thesz studied under Santel for six intensive months and, throughout his career, continued to train under him whenever he was in the California area. Thesz considered his training with the German to be an "incredible gift".

The Grande Messe des morts (or Requiem), Op. 5, by Hector Berlioz was composed in 1837. The Grande Messe des Morts is one of Berlioz's best-known works, with a tremendous orchestration of woodwind and brass instruments, including four antiphonal offstage brass ensembles. The work derives its text from the traditional Latin Requiem Mass. It has a duration of approximately ninety minutes, although there are faster recordings of under seventy-five minutes.

History
In 1837, Adrien de Gasparin, the Minister of the Interior of France, asked Berlioz to compose a Requiem Mass to remember soldiers who died in the Revolution of July 1830, to be performed on the anniversary of Marshal Édouard Mortier's death in Fieschi's assassination attempt on Louis Phillippe in 1835. Berlioz accepted the request, having already wanted to compose a large orchestral work. Meanwhile, the orchestra was growing in size and quality, and the use of woodwinds and brass was expanding due to the increasing ease of intonation afforded by modern instruments. Berlioz later wrote, "if I were threatened with the destruction of the whole of my works save one, I should crave mercy for the Messe des morts." 

After the originally planned performance was cancelled, a ceremony commemorating the death of General Damrémont and the soldiers killed at the Siege of Constantine provided the occasion for the premiere at Les Invalides, conducted by François Habeneck on 5 December 1837.

In his Mémoires, Berlioz claimed that at the premiere of the work, conductor François Habeneck put down his baton during the dramatic "Tuba mirum" (part of the "Dies irae" movement) while he took a pinch of snuff, prompting the composer to rush to the podium to conduct the rest of the work himself, thereby saving the performance from disaster. The premiere was a complete success.

Berlioz revised the work twice in his life, first in 1852, making the final revisions in 1867, only two years before his death.

Structure

Berlioz's Requiem has ten movements, and the structure is as follows:
Introit
1. Requiem aeternam & Kyrie: Introitus
Sequence
2. Dies irae: Prosa, Tuba mirum
3. Quid sum miser
4. Rex tremendae
5. Quaerens me
6. Lacrimosa
Offertory
7. Domine Jesu Christe
8. Hostias
9. Sanctus
10. Agnus Dei

Instrumentation
The Requiem is scored for a very large orchestra, including four brass choirs at the corners of the stage, and chorus:

Woodwinds
4 flutes
2 oboes
2 cors anglais
4 clarinets in B
8 bassoons

Brass
12 horns (4 parts + 2 extra in Mvt 2, in D, E, A, and C)
4 cornets in B
4 tubas

Percussion
16 timpani (6 pairs, 4 single)
2 bass drums
10 pairs of cymbals
4 tam-tams

4 brass choirs
Orchestra 1 to the North
4 cornets
4 trombones
2 tubas
Orchestra 2 to the East
4 trumpets (in E)
4 trombones
Orchestra 3 to the West
4 trumpets (in D)
4 trombones
Orchestra 4 to the South
4 trumpets (in C)
4 trombones
4 ophicleides (usually substituted by tubas)

Voices
Chorus:
80 sopranos and altos (exact ratio not specified)
60 tenors
70 basses

Tenor solo

Strings
25 violin I
25 violin II
20 violas
20 violoncellos
18 double basses

In relation to the number of singers and strings, Berlioz indicates in the score that, "The number [of performers] indicated is only relative. If space permits, the chorus may be doubled or tripled, and the orchestra be proportionally increased. But in the event of an exceptionally large chorus, say 700 to 800 voices, the entire chorus should only be used for the "Dies irae", the "Tuba mirum", and the "Lacrimosa", the rest of the movements being restricted to 400 voices."

The work premiered with over four hundred performers.

Music
The Requiem opens with rising scales in the strings, horns, oboes, and cors anglais preceding the choral entry. The first movement contains the first two sections of the music for the Mass (the Introit and the Kyrie).

The Sequence commences in the second movement, with the "Dies irae" portraying Judgement Day. There are three choral sections each followed by a modulation to the next section. Following the third modulation, the four brass ensembles, specified by Berlioz to be placed at the corners of the stage but more commonly deployed throughout the hall, first appear with a fortissimo E major chord, later joined by 16 timpani, two bass drums, and four tam-tams. The loud flourish is followed by the choral entry, "Tuba mirum", a powerful unison statement by the chorus basses at the top of their register, followed by the rest of the choir. There is a recapitulation of the fanfare, heralding the coming of the Last Judgment ("Judex ergo") by the full choir in canon at the octave. The choir whispers with woodwinds and strings to end the movement.

The third movement, "Quid sum miser", is short, depicting after Judgement Day, featuring an orchestration of TTB chorus, two cors anglais, eight bassoons, cellos, and double basses. The "Rex tremendae" features the second entry of the brass choirs, and contains contrasting dynamics from the choir. "Quaerens me" is a quiet a cappella movement.

The sixth movement, "Lacrimosa", is in  time signature, concluding the Sequence section of the Mass, is the only movement written in recognizable sonata form. The dramatic effect of this movement is heightened by the gradual addition of the massed brass and percussion.

The seventh movement begins the Offertory. "Domine Jesu Christe" opens as a quiet orchestral fugue based on a quasi-modal motif in D minor. The fugue is overlaid with a repeated three-note motif: A, B, and A from the choir, pleading for mercy at the judgment. The choral statements of this motive interweave with the developing orchestral texture for about ten minutes almost to the end, which concludes peacefully. The concluding part of the Offertory, the "Hostias", is short and scored for the male voices, eight trombones, three flutes, and strings.

The ninth movement, the "Sanctus", in D major, employs a solo tenor voice accompanied by long held notes from the flute and muted strings. Hushed women's voices echo the solo lines. A brisk fugue for full choir and orchestra ("Hosanna in excelsis") follows. The whole is repeated with the addition of pianissimo cymbal and bass drum to the "Sanctus" and a much expanded "Hosanna" fugue. Berlioz suggested that the solo part could be sung by ten tenors. The final movement, containing the "Agnus Dei" and Communion sections of the Mass, features long held chords by the woodwinds and strings. The movement recapitulates melodies and effects from previous movements including the "Hostias" and the "Introit".

Notable recordings
"Gloria" is a song by rock band U2. It is the opening track and second single from the band's 1981 album, October.

It features a chorus sung in Latin, from the liturgical "Gloria in Excelsis Deo." It was one of their lowest-charting singles on the UK singles chart, peaking at #55 but was more successful in Ireland and New Zealand, reaching the Top 20.

Allmusic cited the song as an example of "when U2 marry the message, melody, and sound together... the results are thoroughly impressive," while Pitchfork said the song "displays some musical dynamism, but its Latin-language chorus tempers its anthemic qualities."

Composition
"Gloria" highlights bassist Adam Clayton as it features three styles of playing in one song (using a pick for the most part, playing with fingers during the slide guitar by the Edge, then a "slap & pop" solo towards the end).

The chorus "Gloria in te Domine / Gloria exultate" translates to "Glory in You, Lord / Glory, exalt [Him]" with "exalt" in the imperative mood, a reference to Psalm 30:2 (in te Domine, speravi). The song also contains references to Colossians 2:9-10 ("Only in You I'm complete") and James 5:7-9 ("The door is open / You're standing there").

The song also references Van Morrison's 1964 love song "Gloria." Bono is quoted in the 1994 book Race of Angels:

Live performances
"Gloria" has been played in concert more than 370 times. It was debuted on the October Tour prior to the release of the album, and was introduced as "Gloria and Gloria" by Bono. It was played on every tour up to and including the Lovetown Tour, after which it was not played for fifteen years until the Vertigo Tour where it made several appearances. 
It was once again revived on U2's 2015 Innocence + Experience Tour where it was played second in the set list. It often rotated with other early U2 hits such as "The Electric Co.," and "Out of Control.". The song was played again on the Experience + Innocence Tour, where it often rotated with All Because of You and "Red Flag Day". It was played twice on The Joshua Tree Tour 2019, taking the place of "I Will Follow" both times.

Live recordings of the song appear on Under a Blood Red Sky and the Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky DVD.  A live version from the Hammersmith Palais is also available on the October (Special Edition) CD.

Music video
The "Gloria" video, written and directed by Meiert Avis, was filmed in October 1981 on a barge in Grand Canal Dock in Dublin near Windmill Lane. "Gloria" was the first U2 music video that received heavy airplay on MTV. The video featured U2 playing on a barge while a crowd of onlookers danced. Neither the song nor the video has been included in any of the band's compilations.

Keni Dakuidreketi is a former Fijian politician, who served as Minister for Youth, Employment Opportunities, and Minister for Sport in the interim Cabinet formed by Laisenia Qarase in the wake of the Fiji coup of 2000.  He held office till an elected government took power in September 2001, then went back to running his very successful land valuation business. His friends call him Serea, after the part of Viti Levu that he hails from.

He was chief executive of the Fiji Rugby Union, but resigned in 2011.

Since the Fiji coup in 2006, Dakuidreketi has been involved in a court battle surrounding his role as an executive in Fiji's Native Land Trust Board (NLTB). Although the trial has had multiple ups and downs and the case was even thrown out by multiple judges over the course of 8 years, the military government of Voreque Bainimarama continued to push for Dakuidreketi's guilt. Finally, on 14 August 2014, Dakuidreketi was sentenced to a six-year prison sentence.
The piebald shrew (Diplomesodon pulchellus) is a shrew found in the Turan Lowland east of the Caspian Sea in Iran, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 

It grows to  to  in length, and usually hunts for insects and lizards at night.

Taconomy 
It is the only extant member of the genus Diplomesodon. In 2011, A. Cheke described a new and possibly extinct species based on a 19th-century manuscript: Diplomesodon sonnerati (Sonnerat's shrew). It was described again in 2018 to meet certain validity requirements of the ICZN code. The American Society of Mammalogists considers D. sonnerati to be a subspecies of the piebald shrew, if it exists.
"I, Roommate" is the third episode in the  first season of the American animated television series Futurama. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 6, 1999. The title of the episode is a reference to collected short stories written between 1940 and 1950 by author Isaac Asimov titled I, Robot. The episode was written by Eric Horsted and directed by Bret Haaland. The plot focuses on Fry and Bender's search for an apartment after deciding to become roommates and the various difficulties they have in finding a place that is acceptable to both of them.

Plot
Fry has been living in the Planet Express offices, making messes, leaving food out (which attracts owls, the vermin of New New York), wasting water, and generally disrupting business. When it is discovered, however, that Fry has eaten the professor's alien mummy (mistaking it for beef jerky) which the professor was going to eat himself, he declares that Fry has to go.

Fry then moves in with Bender. Bender lives in a robot apartment, which is little more than a two-cubic meter stall, and it soon becomes clear that Bender's cramped apartment cannot meet Fry's needs. Fry cannot even sleep properly, though this is mostly due to Bender repeating "kill all humans" in his sleep. The two begin a search for a living space that will satisfy them both, only to conclude that none of the properties they viewed is remotely livable. Bender and Fry then overhear that one of Professor Farnsworth's colleagues has died, and Fry and Bender are able to lease his spacious, fully furnished apartment. Bender plans to live in the apartment's tiny closet. To the theme of The Odd Couple, Fry and Bender make themselves at home.

The two hold a housewarming party, and the guests arrive with various gifts, including a miniature fruit salad tree from Leela. When the group attempts to watch All My Circuits on the apartment's gigantic television, they discover that Bender's antenna interferes with the building's satellite reception. The landlady promptly evicts Bender. Fry decides to stay, so Bender returns to his old apartment alone. He then embarks on a self-destructive sobriety binge, eventually cutting off his own antenna in the hope that he can move back in with Fry.

When Fry realizes that a robot's antenna is vital to his self-esteem, he helps Bender locate and reattach it, and then moves back in with Bender. When Fry is concerned that his miniature fruit salad tree will not get enough light in the windowless stall, Bender replies that there is a window in the closet and opens a hidden door, revealing a complete living suite more than spacious enough for Fry. To Bender's confusion, Fry happily moves into the "closet".

Production
The episode title is a spoof on the short story collection I, Robot by Isaac Asimov and the earlier short story of the same title by Eando Binder, although the plot of the episode has little to do with the original stories. According to Futurama executive producer David X. Cohen, Farnsworth's mention of the mummified remains of "Zevulon the Great," is a reference to his college roommate, Zev (according to the audio commentary). One of the apartments Fry and Bender look at is a parody of the M. C. Escher woodblock print Relativity.

Broadcast and reception
After two weeks airing in the prime Sunday night time slot between The Simpsons and The X-Files this episode was the first to be shown in Futurama'''s regular slot on Tuesdays as part of a block consisting of four cartoon sitcoms. As expected this move resulted in a drop in the ratings for the show. The initial airing was fourth place in households with a share of 5.7/10 and third among adults 18-49 with a share of 4.0/12, a build of 18% off its lead-in King of the Hill.

Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club'' gave the episode a B, saying, "While the story isn’t as sharp as it could’ve been, it does provide solid structure to support some great jokes, as well as solidifying Bender and Fry’s friendship as more than just a relationship of convenience."
Gargling is the act of bubbling liquid in the mouth. It is also the washing of one's mouth and throat with a liquid, such as mouthwash, that is kept in motion by breathing through it with a gurgling sound.

A traditional home remedy of gargling warm saltwater is sometimes recommended to soothe a sore throat.

One study in Japan has shown that gargling water a few times a day will lower the chance of upper respiratory infections such as common colds, though some medical authorities are skeptical.

Jean IV de Brosse, duc d'Étampes et Chevreuse, comte de Penthièvre (1505 in Lamballe – 31 January 1565) was a French governor, military commander and courtier. The son of René de Brosse and member of a prominent Breton family that had been disgraced during the War of the Public Weal Étampes found himself pushed forward into prominence when king François I arranged a marriage between the count and his mistress Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly. To secure his consent to this political arrangement François created for the couple the Duchy of Étampes and restored effective control of the County of Penthièvre to his family, it having been confiscated after their disgrace. In 1543 his position in Normandy, already expansive was supplemented still further with his appointment as governor of the province. To assist him in governance his nephew Martigues acted as lieutenant-general.

The death of François was a political blow to Étampes. Henri II and his mistress Diane de Poitiers despised his father's mistress, and the couple were compelled to hand over the duchy to Diane. In 1555 he was coerced into selling the Duchy of Chevreuse which he held to the Cardinal of Lorraine. Étampes did not completely fade from favour however, and when Henri II went about formally integrating Brittany into the kingdom of France in 1554, Étampes was assured of his families rights to the county of Penthièvre in return for ceding any rights he might have to the duchy itself.

In 1559 Henri in turn died unexpectedly. He was succeeded by the young François II under the stewardship of the Guise. Catherine de Medici who had been sidelined during the reign of her husband used his death to banish Diane from the court, and as a result Étampes found himself restored to his duchy. Opposition to the Guise government boiled over during the Conspiracy of Amboise, Étampes sought to supress sedition in his governorship, passing on seditious material to the court. Étampes was frustrated by the rapidly evolving and sometimes contradictory royal policy on religion as the country descended towards the French Wars of Religion, noting bitterly that he was receiving contradictory instructions from the Lieutenant-General of the kingdom and the Constable. He fought for the crown in the first war of religion, but was focused on affairs inside his governate, expelling the Protestants from Nantes in July. In 1564 he was granted the right to have his governorship inherited by his nephew Martigues rather than reverting to the crown for the selection of his successor. He died on 31 January 1565.

Early life and family
Jean IV de Brosse was the son of René de Brosse and Jeanne de Commines (daughter of Philippe de Commines).

After the death of his father at the Battle of Pavia, he succeeded him as nominal Count of Penthièvre.

Reign of François I
In 1533, on François I's instruction he married Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly, the mistress of the king, and was shortly thereafter created Count, then Duke of Étampes. this marriage also re-secured for his family the County of Penthièvre that had been seized from them following their involvement in the League of the Public Weal as a reward for facilitating the king access to his mistress. However, he was greatly impoverished by the expenditures necessary to maintain their position at court. In 1543 he was appointed governor of Brittany, to assist him in administering the province, his nephew Martigues was chosen as his lieutenant-general, handling many of the military affairs of the territory.

Reign of Henri II
With the death of François I, the antipathy of Diane de Poitiers compelled Étampes to retreat to Brittany and further she obtained his duchy of Étampes. During the early reign of Henri II Étampes maintained his position in the conseil des parties a looser less important council outside the conseil privé. In 1554 Henri pursued the formal annexation of Brittany into France through the Parlement of the region. In return for ceding any rights he might have to be duke of Brittany, Étampes was guaranteed his rights over the county of Penthièvre the following year. In 1555 Étampes and his wife were dispossessed of the duchy of Chevreuse, compelled to sell it and the lands of Meudon to Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine in return for 50,000 écus.

Reign of François II
On the death of king Henri II the Guise, whom Étampes had ceded Chevreuse to, took charge for the young François. There was considerable opposition to their administration that coalesced into the Conspiracy of Amboise. This attempt to seize the king failed, and the conspiracy was broken as it tried to storm the castle of Amboise. Nevertheless many elements of the conspiracy were not present, including the seigneur de Maligny who the Guise believed was taking refuge in Brittany. They urged Étampes in his capacity as governor of the province to provide him to the court, so that they might perform justice. Étampes was however unable to locate him, and Maligny would go on to be involved in a conspiracy in Lyon later the same year. Étampes reported on seditious placards he found in Nantes to the Guisard government in the following months, emboldened by the conspiracy of the previous months.

Reign of Charles IX

Crisis of authority
Due to the weakness of the central administration as the religious crisis deepened, the crown was compelled to ask Étampes to publicly offer his support to the regency, to demonstrate that leading magnates were still loyal. He in turn asked for letters from the court demonstrating their favour to him, so that he might show them to his subordinates in the province to 'give them courage.' In early 1561 he was informed that the court no longer wished for him to apprehend Protestants who were not under arms and only assembling peacefully in small numbers. This was despite the continued illegality of Protestantism until 1562. The continually evolving religious policy frustrated him, and he wrote angrily to Antoine of Navarre complaining that to many in his province, the changing methods of his handling of religion appeared like a manifestation of his personal prejudices rather than royal policy. By 1562 the policy was beyond rapidly evolving and had become contradictory. Étampes despaired as to how he was to govern Nantes, noting that the lieutenant-general had asked him to confiscate arms from the Protestants but do no more, while the Constable had asked him to drive the Protestants from his province.

First war of religion
During the first war of religion, Étampes fought for the crown, and was responsible for raising troops in Normandy to assist the effort. In July however he was instructed by  the crown to disband some of the units he had raised as a measure of economy. Étampes protested to Navarre the lieutenant-general of the kingdom in disgust, warning that if he was no longer responsible for the troops that they would seek their pay from the rebels instead. The crown urged him to seize church plate to help reduce the costs of the war, however Étampes was unenthused by the idea, noting that particularly in south Brittany this would be met by considerable resistance from the populace. He proposed instead calling the provincial estates to solve the revenue issue, the crown refused but permitted him to call diocese assemblies, through which he raised taxes to pay his garrisons. In the same month he undertook the expulsion of Protestants from the city of Nantes, and sequestered tax receipts and ignored other orders from court, writing bitterly to the regent about his situation and his difficulties ensuring order.

Succession
Ėtampes was granted the right in 1564, upon his death, to resign his governorship of Brittany in favour of his nephew Martigues, who would govern the province until his own death in 1569. This practice had been very rare during the reign of François I, but was proliferating by that of Charles IX as governors successfully maintained their posts within their families at a far higher frequency. Étampes died on 31 January 1565.
Jock of the Bushveld is a true story by South African author Sir James Percy FitzPatrick. The 1907 book tells of FitzPatrick's travels with his dog, Jock, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross, during the 1880s, when he worked as a storeman, prospector's assistant, journalist and ox-wagon transport-rider in the Bushveld region of the Transvaal (then the South African Republic).

Early life
Jock's mother Jess was the only dog in their camp. FitzPatrick describes her as "an unattractive bull-terrier with a dull brindled coat–black and grey in shadowy stripes. She had small cross-looking eyes and uncertain always-moving ears; she was bad tempered and most unsociable", but everybody respected her. Jock's father is only described as an imported dog in the book and there's an ongoing debate on whether he was an American Staffordshire Terrier or of a breed like the bull and terrier.

FitzPatrick describes the puppies: "Five of the litter were fat strong yellow chaps with dark muzzles—like their father. The sixth one was about half the size of the others. He wasn't yellow like the others, nor dark brindled like Jess, but a sort of dirty pale half-and-half colour with dark faint wavy lines all over him; and he had a dark little muzzle." Since the runt had not been spoken for, Percy slowly came upon the idea of taking him on as his own. He called him Jock and it seemed as if the puppy knew that FitzPatrick was his master from day one. He even followed him home without any coaching.

Reputation

This was the start of many a great adventure. The odd little puppy grew into a great and fearless dog. He was well liked, well respected and well behaved. He lived out his life at Percy's side with unwavering loyalty and his loving memory inspired many a bedtime story to Percy's three children. However, it was only when FitzPatrick had made his fortune, settled down to have a family and become an established and well-respected member of society that he took pen to paper at the urging of his children and shared these delightful tales with the rest of the world.

FitzPatrick gave Jock to a friend until he had a safer place for him to live in the town, where with his deafness, he was unsafe from traffic and people. The friend, Ted, loaned Jock to a store-owner Tom Barnett, who was having trouble with thieves and kraal dogs.

Publication
FitzPatrick later recounted these adventures as bedtime stories to his four children. Rudyard Kipling, a good friend of FitzPatrick, also took part in these story-telling evenings and eventually persuaded him to collect these tales in book form.

Jock of the Bushveld was first published in 1907 and had an extremely warm reception, being reprinted four times in that year alone.  Since then it has achieved the status of a classic South African book and has been also widely read abroad – more than one hundred editions have been printed and it has been translated into Afrikaans, Dutch, French, Xhosa and Zulu, amongst others. Illustrations for the book were done by Edmund Caldwell, a brother of Mary Tourtel, creator of Rupert Bear.

A widely available 'modernised' South African edition published by AD Donker Publishers, according to its editor Linda Rosenberg, has been cleansed of its 'prejudicial racial references', while 'the esoteric charm and innocent philosophical tone have been left scrupulously intact'.

Death

The main version of how Jock died is told as follows : When Fitzpatrick went to live in Barberton, he realised Jock was miserable living in a town and gave the dog to his friend Tom Barnett, who ran a supply store in what became Mozambique.  One night when Tom Barnett called him, he mistakenly shot Jock, because he was thought to be the dog killing chickens on the farm (when Jock had meanwhile already killed the other intruding dog). See Gelert and "Faithful Hound" folk-tale motif, which lives on as an urban legend. It is classified as Aarne–Thompson type 178A.

The exact location of Jock's grave is unfortunately not officially marked or known. However, in 1947 Fitzpatrick's daughter Cecily Niven, backtracked her father's 
travels according to the 
description in "Jock of the Bushveld" and wrote about her findings in her book "Jock & Fitz" published 1968.

Mrs. Niven claimed to have located the area of the grave and stated the coordinates as: 25°46'5.0"S 32°20'4.0"E .

Any remnants of Tom Barnett's store and the wild Fig tree, under which Jock was buried and "Jock" had been carved upon, was long gone.

Fragments of building materials and broken china was uncovered at the site. Today the area is only 400m from the N4 road near Sonte, Mozambique

According to Gubbins in a letter dated 4 August 1933, the site of the fig tree bearing Jock's name, was close to the Possene railway station. The fig tree was cleared around 1933 and he tried with the assistance of railway personnel to mark the spot. Gubbins communication is held by the University of the Witwatersrand. According to Dr Gerrit Haarhoff another older Gubbins was present during Jock's trek.

Sir Percy Fitzpatrick himself is buried at 33°28'25.2"S 25°36'21.1"E .

Statue
Percy FitzPatrick's daughter and only surviving child, Cecily Niven promoted her father's legacy in the Lowveld by erecting bronze plaques and statues at places of significance to the story of Jock. The most famous statue of Jock was sculpted by the well-known South African artist, Ivan Mitford-Barberton. It was erected on a farm in the Lowveld, but was moved to the Barberton, Mpumalanga Town Hall in 1984, during the town's centenary.

Movies
Wilbur Smith adapted the book into a screenplay for a movie that was never filmed.

The book was made into a movie in 1986, starring Jonathan Rands, Gordon Mulholland and Jocelyn Broderick with Mfubu as Jock. The movie did not prove popular with American audiences however, primarily due to its sad ending. Another fictional movie with an ending that was more palatable to this audience was therefore released in 1994.

At the end of 2007 Duncan MacNeillie together with a small team of animators moved from Nelspruit to Johannesburg to start production on Jock of the Bushveld. It took a team of 25 animators 3 years to complete the film. Midway through 2009 the decision was made to complete the film in Stereoscopic. Scheduling the release of a 3D animated movie called Jock the Hero Dog on 24 July 2012, Canadian singer Bryan Adams voiced the title character.

Criticism 
Recent readings of the book have called for its colonial narratives to be viewed critically, especially given its racially problematic language, colonial tropes and idealization of imperialism. In the Postscript to Jock FitzPatrick refers to Tsonga people as Zulu people who have "degenerated by mixture with inferior races". Critic Stephen Gray points out that the book is an instrument of FitzPatrick's imperial values. Drew Forrest argues that the book is opposed to post-apartheid values in South Africa but maintains that it should still be available even in its unabridged form because of the value it holds in teaching lessons about this era of South African history.
Spike Feresten (born September 3, 1964) is an American television writer, screenwriter, comedian and television personality, who is best known for his work on Seinfeld, writing for David Letterman, and hosting the late night Talkshow with Spike Feresten from 2006 to 2009 on Fox. He is the former host of Esquire Network's series Car Matchmaker with Spike Feresten.  He currently hosts the podcast Spike's Car Radio with Paul Zuckerman. He was also a screenwriter for the 2007 animated film Bee Movie.

Early life and career
Feresten was born on September 3, 1964 in Fall River, Massachusetts and raised in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, where he attended public schools. He lived with his parents, Mary Jo and Michael, and younger brother, Wally Feresten. Feresten then attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he planned to prepare for a career in music. However, according to Feresten, while there he was kicked out of his dormitory for dropping light bulbs out of his eighth story window, before seeing David Letterman perform the same stunt on his show a few weeks later. "I thought, 'God, he is getting paid. This is what network television pays you to do. Maybe I need to think twice about this music career.'" Feresten dropped out of college in order to attempt a career in television, working first as an intern at NBC in New York City, before being promoted to receptionist.

Feresten began his career writing for Saturday Night Live, where he first got the nickname "Spike" while working there as a receptionist. "It came from 'Saturday Night Live'. I was a receptionist, and I had hair licks. And one of the PAs at the time gave me the nickname. And I said, "No problem as long as you don't fire me. Call me whatever you want." According to Feresten, he started writing for the show when Dennis Miller, who was hosting "Weekend Update", started using jokes that Feresten was passing on to him. "I think my first joke had something to do with Oliver North. I can't remember it. But I remember once it aired, it was like smoking crack." 
 
He moved from there to the writing staff of Late Night with David Letterman and then later the Late Show with David Letterman. Describing the process of working for Letterman:

It's a lot of fun. You come in and read a couple newspapers and start your day with a nice appetizer of opening remarks. And during the day, you get these different writing assignments. We would write four to eight pages of jokes a day -- and at a moment's notice might be flying off to the Daytona 500 with Mujibur and Sirajul. 

In the 1990s, he wrote for the cult cartoon spoof talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, which process he described as:
Two things: First you pitch them an idea that you want to do. Once they say they like the direction you are going, there is a lot of creative freedom, so they let you write it. They send you a list of people they have interviewed as guests. They have already done the interviews. They have the voice of Space Ghost ask a bunch of questions and they have a bunch of responses. You can pick your guest and see if it works within the premise of your show then you get to re-write the questions. 

Feresten went on to write for The Dana Carvey Show, before getting his big break with The Simpsons and Seinfeld in 1995.

Feresten wrote one episode for The Simpsons during its seventh season, called "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", which aired on November 26, 1995, in which Sideshow Bob escapes once again from prison and takes control of a TV screen at an airshow, demanding all television stations immediately go off the air. Feresten has said that while he wrote and was credited for the script, it was completely rewritten keeping only the basic ideas intact, as that was usual writing process for the show.

Work on Seinfeld 
In 1995, Feresten left the late-night realm to join the writing staff of the hugely successful sitcom Seinfeld during the show's seventh season, and stayed there for three seasons until the show's finale, becoming supervising producer in 1998. During his tenure at Seinfeld, Feresten received three Emmy nominations, including one for his famed "Soup Nazi" episode, which remains part of the pop-culture vernacular. The episodes he wrote were:

Season 7
 "The Soup Nazi"
 "The Wig Master"

Season 8
 "The Little Kicks"
 "The Andrea Doria"
 "The Muffin Tops"

Season 9

 "The Junk Mail"
 "The Reverse Peephole"
 "The Bookstore"
 "The Puerto Rican Day"

Television work post-Seinfeld
After Seinfeld ended in 1998, Spike went to work writing on pilots (including one with Louis C.K.) and the short-lived The Michael Richards Show, as well as enjoying a short stint as producer of The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, which ended in April 2004.

Talkshow with Spike Feresten
In 2006, Feresten began his own talk-show on Saturday nights on Fox called Talkshow with Spike Feresten. While originally envisioned as an entertainment news parody, "Talkshow" developed into a mix of traditional talkshow segments with sketch elements, field pieces, fake commercials and pop culture parodies. Feresten described the show's format to Variety magazine as being, "all the comedy you'd find in a talkshow, but without any of the talk." Notable guests on the show included Tom Green, Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Andy Richter, Tom Arnold, Carl Reiner, Tim Heidecker, Vanilla Ice and Eric Wareheim. On the process of finding guests for the show, Feresten admitted: "We call friends. Sometimes we are very close to having our receptionist on the air. But because we're not guest driven, we just seek out funny people that we know."

It ran for three seasons, making it the longest-running late night television show in the history of the Fox network. From January 17, 2006, to February 21, 2009, the show had a six-week test run of hour-long episodes airing an hour earlier than usual; this came in the wake of the cancellation of MADtv. The show was cancelled in May 2009.

Giuseppe Francesco Gaspare Melchiorre Baldassare Sammartini (also Gioseffo, S Martini, St Martini, San Martini, San Martino, Martini, Martino; 6 January 1695 – between 17 and 23 November 1750) was an Italian composer and oboist during the late Baroque and early Classical era. Although he was from Milan, most of his professional life was spent in London and with Frederick, the Prince of Wales. He also had a younger brother, Giovanni Battista Sammartini, who likewise became a renowned composer.

Personal life
Giuseppe Sammartini was born in Milan, Italy. Giuseppe took oboe lessons from his French father Alexis Saint-Martin. Although born in Milan, Giuseppe found his success in other parts of Europe. His first trip was to Brussels, and from there he made his way to London where he would go on to spend the rest of his life. Giuseppe did return to Milan for his sister Madalena's marriage on 13 February 1728. In July 1728 Giuseppe also travelled to Brussels with his pupil Gaetano Parenti.

Performer
Sammartini was an exceptionally skilled oboist. He could play the flute and recorder, as was customary at the time. Before moving to London, he was the oboist at  in Milan around 1717. He then became the oboist at the Teatro Regio Ducale in 1720. He even gained fame in London as "the greatest [oboist] the world had ever known". He performed in places such as Lincoln's Inn Fields, Hickford's Room, Castle concerts, and in the opera orchestra at The King's Theatre. As an oboist, Giuseppe was unbelievably successful, and significantly advanced the level of oboe playing. Giuseppe was even able to make the oboe sound voice-like at times. One of his most notable students was the Englishman Thomas Vincent.

Composer
He was well versed in the ways of counterpoint and proper harmony. This made him a very skilled composer of his time. One of Giuseppe's first published collections was a set of 12 trio sonatas. It was published in London by Walsh & Hare. Sammartini's career as a composer advanced when he was hired as the music master for the Prince of Wales, Frederick, and his wife Augusta. He worked for them and their children from 1736 until his death in 1750. While working for the family, Sammartini dedicated many works to the different members of the family. His 12 sonatas op. 1 were dedicated to Frederick, and his 12 trios op. 3 to Augusta. Sammartini was clearly very attached to this family, writing everything from these wonderful collections to simple birthday tunes for the children.

Most of Sammartini's chamber music was played and re-published regularly during his life. However, many of the concertos and overtures that Sammartini wrote were not published until after his death, but then gained wide acceptance, even more than other Italian composers such as Corelli.

Musical style
Although Sammartini wrote in a later Baroque style, he also incorporated many Classical elements. Sammartini was forward thinking as a composer, and even used ideas such as a galant style and Sturm und Drang, (the idea of extreme and stormy emotions). Sammartini had other clearly forward thinking musical trends. An example of this would be the number of movements in some of his concertos and symphonies.  

Being primarily an instrumental composer, Sammartini wrote a significant amount of solo sonatas. Due to his professional instrument, many of these sonatas were written for the flute, recorder, and oboe. One of his unique idioms was starting a sonata with a slow movement. His larger orchestral works often featured four to five movements with slow transitional movements. Giuseppe Sammartini was one of the first composers to write keyboard concertos in England, causing him to be an exceptionally influential composer for his time.

Works
24 sonatas for recorder and bass,
30 trios for flutes or violins,
24 concerti grossi,
4 keyboard concertos,
oboe concertos,
16 overtures,
some cello sonatas,
some flute duets.

One of Sammartini's most famous pieces is his Concerto in F major for recorder, strings and continuo. A catalogue of his works (recognizable by the signal  "GSM") has been established in 2020 by B. Laurent.
Zhanna Vladimirovna Bichevskaya (born June 17, 1944) is a prominent Russian singer and folk musician.

She was born in Moscow. In 1971 she graduated from the Moscow Circus and Performing Arts School. She was a teacher of music in Zagorsk (Sergiev Posad). In the 1970s, Zhanna started to perform Russian folk songs and romances.

At that time she was influenced by Bulat Okudzhava, and she gained popularity in Russia and abroad with some critics dubbing her the Russian Joan Baez. Her unique style of music is described as Russian country-folk.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Zhanna Bichevskaya's songs began to have more political, nationalist and spiritual themes. She performed a series of White Guard officer's songs, as well as a series of patriotic, monarchist and religious songs, some times songs dedicated to the Romanov Holy Martyrs. The lyrics to the latter were composed by Father Roman, a priest of the Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery. Her album "Hieromonk Romans's songs" was blessed by him in 1997.

In 1999, Zhanna also became the host of her own show on Voice of Russia radio station. She was awarded People’s Artist of the RSFSR.

Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd. is a listed property developer in Hong Kong and a constituent of the Hang Seng Index. The company's principal activities are property development and investment, project management, construction, hotel operation, department store operation, finance, investment holding and infrastructure. It is the third largest Hong Kong real estate developer by market capitalisation. The company is controlled by Lee Shau Kee, who owns approximately 70.17% of the share capital as of June 2015.

History 
Founded by Li Shau-kee, the company was taken public in 1981 by Sun Hung Kai Securities. The shares were introduced at HK$4 by a novel, geared, method – there was to be an initial downpayment of HK$1 per share upon subscribing to the offer, with cash calls of another HK$1 six months later. The final HK$2 instalment would be due at the year end.

In 2006, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) found that Henderson had breached the foreign-exchange regulations in the amount of HK$565 million. Henderson allegedly engaged Shenzhen Zhaotian Investments, headed by Tian Chenggang – whose father is former vice-premier Tian Jiyun – to lobby for leniency from the potential fine of 150 million yuan, according to Tian. On 4 December 2006, the company was issued with a fine of 2.33 million yuan (HK$2.9 million), which the company paid. Zhaotian sued in Hong Kong in 2012, claiming an oral agreement between Tian Chenggang and CFO Alexander Au for a HK$43 million "consultation fee", and failed upon appeal in 2015 due to the absence of documentary evidence of the agreement.

Subsidiaries and associates
The company's stakes in its principal associates as at 31 December 2014 were Towngas (41.51%), Miramar Hotel and Investment Co, Ltd (45.08%) and Hong Kong Ferry (33.33%).

Henderson Investment
As at 31 December 2014, Henderson Investment ("HI") was a 69.27% listed subsidiary of the Company (67.14% as at 30 June 2006), which previously held the group stakes in the Hong Kong Ferry (Holdings) Company, the Miramar Hotel Group, and The Hong Kong and China Gas Company. Its shares have been consistently trading at below NAV.

Privatisation attempt
In November 2002, the company attempted to buy out minority shareholders by making an all-cash offer of HKD 7.60, representing a 40% discount to NAV. The buyout offer fell when it was opposed by more than 14% of the holders of the outstanding shares. In November 2005, it made another attempt when it offered one share for every 2.6 share in HI, although the offer was subsequently sweetened to 2.5 shares. The revised deal valued HI at an 18% discount to its net asset value. The company had persuaded shareholder Templeton Investment to back the buyout. Nevertheless, this second offer was again rejected, more narrowly this time, by 10.94% of the minority vote. This was in excess of the statutory blocking vote of 10%.

Asset sale to parent

Miramar and HK Ferry
When trading in both companies' shares were suspended on 26 March, there was speculation that the Company would launch another buyout attempt after the expiry of the one year legal moratorium.

On 27 March 2007, it was reported that the Company would not make another privatisation bid for the time being, but offered HK$12.1 billion for some of its subsidiary's assets, principally the holdings in Miramar Hotel and Hong Kong Ferry held by Henderson Investment. HI would make a special distribution of HK$5 per HI after the sale. Net of the HKD10.35 billion special distribution for its 73.5% stake, Henderson's net cash outlay will be $1.75 billion.

Towngas
On 3 October 2007, the company proposed to pay market value only to gain control of Towngas. It would acquire the 39.06 percent stake in Towngas held by subsidiary Henderson Investment for HK$42.86 billion in cash and convertible notes. Minority shareholders of Henderson Investment, who together hold 30.73%, would receive 204.1 million Henderson Land shares and HK$1.19 billion in cash. The offer was considered by analysts to be favourable to the Company, and David Webb criticised the deal saying Henderson was acquiring the stake on the cheap, without paying any control premium to minority shareholders of Henderson Investment. Webb further criticised the nature of the offer as a back-door privatisation of Henderson Investment, which would virtually be a shell company after the transfer of the stake.

On 7 November, Henderson sweetened the offer to appease minority shareholders (mainly Elliott Capital) by increasing the cash portion to HK$2.24 per share. On 7 December 2007, Henderson secured shareholders' support for the usurpation.

Sunlight REIT
On 8 December 2006, the company spun off and listed 12 office and 8 retail properties in Hong Kong into a Real Estate Investment Trust, Sunlight. However, the issue fell by 6.5% on its market début on 21 December, and as at March 2007 has fallen 16.2 percent (since the listing) due to investors' apprehension of financial engineering of the REIT.

The estimated distribution yield stands at 10%, the highest among Hong Kong REITs. Yet, investors fear a decline of distribution after yield-boosting mechanisms, such as interest swaps. Henderson Land also offered a temporary dividend waiver as a sweetener. Yields are expected to fall in 2010, and again in 2012 as rental reversions come through. The issue's flop was cited as the reason Regal Hotels International chose to delay its own planned REIT offering.

Development projects

Beverly Hill

Beverly Hill is an upper class private housing estate in Happy Valley, Hong Kong, jointly developed by Henderson Land Development and Hang Lung Properties in 1988. It has ten 37-storey residential blocks built at a very steep slope of Broadwood Road and Link Road.

International Finance Centre 

In a joint venture with Sun Hung Kai and MTR Corporation, the company developed the International Finance Centre complex, which includes the landmark waterfront property and then tallest building in Hong Kong, completed in 2003. Since its completion, the company has its headquarters in the building.

39 Conduit Road 
39 Conduit Road is a residential development by the company situated in the mid-levels in Hong Kong. Soon after the development was launched in October 2009, the developer claimed to have sold a five bedroom duplex flat, on the "68th floor" of the 46-storey the building for HK$439 million (US$57m). The price, equating to US$9,200 per square foot, set the new world record for the most expensive apartment.

Due to selective numbering, a total of 42 intermediate floor numbers are missing from 39 Conduit Road: these include 14, 24, 34, 64, all floors between 40 and 59. The floor above the 68th is the 88th. The Democratic Party accused the developer of misleading; the Consumer Council recognised the accepted common practice of skipping the 13th and 14th floors, but suggested that developers "imaginary heights brought back to earth." Lee Shau Kee argued that buyers liked the numbering scheme.

248 Queens Road East 
A 40-storey building developed in 1998.
USS Jarvis (DD-799) was a  destroyer of the United States Navy, the third Navy ship named for Midshipman James C. Jarvis (1787–1800), who was killed at the age of 13 during the historic engagement between the famed frigate  and the French frigate La Vengeance.

Jarvis was laid down by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington; 7 June 1943; launched 14 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Harold Burkit, daughter of  Rufus C. Holman, U.S. Senator from Oregon; and commissioned 3 June 1944.

Service history

World War II 

After shakedown off the California coast, Jarvis departed Seattle 25 August for Pearl Harbor as escort for the battleship . Arriving 31 August, she proceeded independently 3 September to Adak, Alaska, to join the North Pacific Force, engaged in operations against the Kurile Islands. Operating out of Adak and Attu, Jarvis battled stormy seas and prolonged bad weather to conduct eight raids on shipping and shore installations from Paramushiru to Matsuwa. After returning to Adak 15 August 1945 from her last raid, she steamed to Aomori, Honshū, to support occupation operations. Arriving Aomori 8 September, she plied the Sea of Japan, assisting occupation landings and destroying military installations on Honshū and Hokkaidō. Jarvis departed Yokosuka, Honshū, 19 November for the United States. Arriving Pearl Harbor 29 November, she joined the "Magic Carpet" fleet and sailed 1 December for the East Coast via San Diego and the Panama Canal, returning veterans of the Pacific War. She reached Charleston, South Carolina, 22 December; deactivated as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet 11 April 1946; and decommissioned 29 June.

1951 – 1960 

With the development and enlargement of the Korean War, Jarvis recommissioned 8 February 1951. She operated in the Atlantic out of Charleston and Norfolk, Va. for more than a year before departing Norfolk 15 May 1952 for deployment to Korea. Steaming via Panama, the West Coast, and Japan, she arrived off Korea's eastern coast 23 June and began blockade and interdiction patrols. Under her skipper, Comdr. C. D. McCall, she ranged the coast from Songjin to Chongjin, conducting operations with the 7th Fleet until returning to Yokosuka, Japan, 18 August. Following operations in Japanese waters, she joined the Formosa Patrol from 26 September to 10 October. After completing this important duty, she proceeded to the Philippine Islands; and on the 18th she departed Subic Bay for the United States via Ceylon, Suez, and Gibraltar, arriving Norfolk 12 December.

Jarvis resumed operations with the Atlantic Fleet and on 4 May 1954 deployed to the Mediterranean, arriving Naples, Italy, 18 May. Before returning to Norfolk 9 July, she operated with the mighty 6th Fleet, America's deterrent to Communist aggression in the Middle East.

Clearing Norfolk 5 January 1955, Jarvis sailed to the West Coast, arriving Long Beach 26 January. After training off the California Coast, she departed 21 April on the first of five post-Korean War deployments to the Far East. As a unit of the powerful and versatile 7th Fleet, she ranged the Western Pacific from Japan to the Philippines, ever alert to insure peace in the unsettled Far East. While on her 1955 deployment to the Far East, she supported the evacuation of thousands of refugees from North to South Vietnam during Operation Passage to Freedom. During all her deployments she conducted patrols in the Formosa Strait to help stabilize the Nationalist-Communist struggle and prevent the invasion of Formosa from the mainland. In 1958 she provided valuable assistance for the Chinese Nationalists during the threatened Communist invasion of Quemoy and Matsu.

Jarvis returned to Long Beach from her fifth deployment 4 March 1960 and resumed coastal operations until 24 September when she sailed for the East Coast. Arriving Philadelphia 16 October, Jarvis decommissioned 24 October and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

Alcalá Galiano 

On 3 November 1960 the ship was turned over to Spain on a 5-year renewable loan under terms of the Military Assistance Program. She served the Spanish Navy as  Alcalá Galiano, at first with hull number 44, then designated D 24.

Alcalá Galiano was stricken 15 December 1988 and broken up for scrap.

Kieran Prendiville (born 25 December 1947) is an English-Irish television writer, producer, and presenter.

Early life
Prendiville was born on 25 December 1947 in Rochdale, Lancashire, the son of an Irish father from Killorglin, County Kerry, who had relocated to Rochdale to practise medicine. He attended Clongowes Wood College in Clane, County Kildare, the same Jesuit boarding school his father had attended.

Career

Presenting
Working alongside Glyn Worsnip, Prendiville was a presenter of the BBC consumer programme That's Life! from 1973 to 1978, having served on the production team from the very first episode. He was the BBC's on-site commentator on the first Space Shuttle mission, reporting from Cape Canaveral and Edwards Air Force Base.  He was also a reporter at football matches on the BBC's Grandstand Saturday afternoon sports programme in the 1980s.

Writing
The creator of the 1990s BBC dramas Ballykissangel and Roughnecks, Prendiville's other writing credits include episodes of The Bill, Boon and Perfect Scoundrels (all ITV). He received praise and criticism for Care (2000), his controversial drama about child abuse in a Welsh children's home.
Non-stoichiometric compounds are chemical compounds, almost always solid inorganic compounds, having elemental composition whose proportions cannot be represented by a ratio of small natural numbers (i.e. an empirical formula); most often, in such materials, some small percentage of atoms are missing or too many atoms are packed into an otherwise perfect lattice work.

Contrary to earlier definitions, modern understanding of non-stoichiometric compounds view them as homogeneous, and not mixtures of stoichiometric chemical compounds. Since the solids are overall electrically neutral, the defect is compensated by a change in the charge of other atoms in the solid, either by changing their oxidation state, or by replacing them with atoms of different elements with a different charge. Many metal oxides and sulfides have non-stoichiometric examples; for example, stoichiometric iron(II) oxide, which is rare, has the formula , whereas the more common material is nonstoichiometric, with the formula . The type of equilibrium defects in non-stoichiometric compounds can vary with attendant variation in bulk properties of the material. Non-stoichiometric compounds also exhibit special electrical or chemical properties because of the defects; for example, when atoms are missing, electrons can move through the solid more rapidly.  Non-stoichiometric compounds have applications in ceramic and superconductive material and in electrochemical (i.e., battery) system designs.

Occurrence

Iron oxides
Nonstoichiometry is pervasive for metal oxides, especially when the metal is not in its highest oxidation state. For example, although wüstite (ferrous oxide) has an ideal (stoichiometric) formula , the actual stoichiometry is closer to .  The non-stoichiometry reflect the ease of oxidation of  to  effectively replacing a small portion of  with two thirds their number of .  Thus for every three "missing"  ions, the crystal contains two  ions to balance the charge. The composition of a non-stoichiometric compound usually varies in a continuous manner over a narrow range.  Thus, the formula for wüstite is written as , where x is a small number (0.05 in the previous example) representing the deviation from the "ideal" formula. Nonstoichiometry is especially important in solid, three-dimensional polymers that can tolerate mistakes.  To some extent, entropy drives all solids to be non-stoichiometric.  But for practical purposes, the term describes materials where the non-stoichiometry is measurable, usually at least 1% of the ideal composition.

Iron sulfides

The monosulfides of the transition metals are often nonstoichiometric. Best known perhaps is nominally iron(II) sulfide (the mineral pyrrhotite) with a composition  (x = 0 to 0.2). The rare stoichiometric  endmember is known as the mineral troilite. Pyrrhotite is remarkable in that it has numerous polytypes, i.e. crystalline forms differing in symmetry (monoclinic or hexagonal) and composition (and others). These materials are always iron-deficient owing to the presence of lattice defects, namely iron vacancies. Despite those defects, the composition is usually expressed as a ratio of large numbers and the crystals symmetry is relatively high. This means the iron vacancies are not randomly scattered over the crystal, but form certain regular configurations. Those vacancies strongly affect the magnetic properties of pyrrhotite: the magnetism increases with the concentration of vacancies and is absent for the stoichiometric .

Palladium hydrides
Palladium hydride is a nonstoichiometric material of the approximate composition  (0.02 < x < 0.58).  This solid conducts hydrogen by virtue of the mobility of the hydrogen atoms within the solid.

Tungsten oxides
It is sometimes difficult to determine if a material is non-stoichiometric or if the formula is best represented by large numbers.  The oxides of tungsten illustrate this situation.  Starting from the idealized material tungsten trioxide, one can generate a series of related materials that are slightly deficient in oxygen.  These oxygen-deficient species can be described as , but in fact they are stoichiometric species with large unit cells with the formulas , where n = 20, 24, 25, 40.  Thus, the last species can be described with the stoichiometric formula , whereas the non-stoichiometric description   implies a more random distribution of oxide vacancies.

Other cases
At high temperatures (1000 °C), titanium sulfides present a series of non-stoichiometric compounds.

The coordination polymer Prussian blue, nominally  and their analogs are well known to form in non-stoichiometric proportions. The non-stoichiometric phases exhibit useful properties vis-à-vis their ability to bind caesium and thallium ions.

Applications

Oxidation catalysis
Many useful compounds are produced by the reactions of hydrocarbons with oxygen, a conversion that is catalyzed by metal oxides.  The process operates via the transfer of "lattice" oxygen to the hydrocarbon substrate, a step that temporarily generates a vacancy (or defect).  In a subsequent step, the missing oxygen is replenished by O2. Such catalysts rely on the ability of the metal oxide to form phases that are not stoichiometric.  An analogous sequence of events describes other kinds of atom-transfer reactions including hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization catalysed by solid catalysts.  These considerations also highlight the fact that stoichiometry is determined by the interior of crystals: the surfaces of crystals often do not follow the stoichiometry of the bulk.  The complex structures on surfaces are described by the term "surface reconstruction".

Ion conduction
The migration of atoms within a solid is strongly influenced by the defects associated with non-stoichiometry.  These defect sites provide pathways for atoms and ions to migrate through the otherwise dense ensemble of atoms that form the crystals.  Oxygen sensors and solid state batteries  are two applications that rely on oxide vacancies.  One example is the CeO2-based sensor in automotive exhaust systems.  At low partial pressures of O2, the sensor allows the introduction of increased air to effect more thorough combustion.

Superconductivity

Many superconductors are non-stoichiometric. For example, yttrium barium copper oxide, arguably the most notable high-temperature superconductor, is a non-stoichiometric solid with the formula YxBa2Cu3O7−x. The critical temperature of the superconductor depends on the exact value of x.  The stoichiometric species has x = 0, but this value can be as great as 1.

History

It was mainly through the work of Nikolai Semenovich Kurnakov and his students that Berthollet's opposition to Proust's law was shown to have merit for many solid compounds. Kurnakov divided non-stoichiometric compounds into berthollides  and daltonides depending on whether their properties showed monotonic behavior with respect to composition or not. The term berthollide was accepted by IUPAC in 1960. The names come from Claude Louis Berthollet and John Dalton, respectively, who in the 19th century advocated rival theories of the composition of substances.  Although Dalton "won" for the most part, it was later recognized that the law of definite proportions had important exceptions.
Eleonora Brown (born August 22, 1948, in Naples) is an Italian film actress. Her first, and perhaps biggest, role was at age twelve as the daughter of Sophia Loren's character in Two Women (1960).

Career 
Brown's primary acting role was in Two Women. In an interview about the movie, Brown stated that Sophia Loren, who played her mother, protected her from some of the underlying implications of the rape scene in the film. She also said that director Vittorio De Sica brought her to tears for the climactic final scene (upon hearing that the character played by Jean-Paul Belmondo had died) by saying that a telegram had arrived saying that Brown's parents had died in an accident.

Brown appeared in a few other films in the 1960s, including The Sailor from Gibraltar, The Tiger and the Pussycat and Cuore matto... matto da legare, before choosing to retire from acting at age 19, after her appearance in The Young, the Evil, and the Savage (1968).

Brown later attended John Cabot University in Rome, graduating with a degree in Business and Economics. She then worked as a translator at the Italian Parliament, while also doing voice acting, in both English and Italian, for two decades in Italy.

Brown made her first screen appearance in 50 years in the 2018 Italian film Un Amore Così Grande (A Love So Big). The film focuses on the world of opera in Verona, Italy, and features performances by the operatic pop trio Il Volo.

Family
Brown's parents met when her American father was introduced to her Neapolitan mother while he was working with the International Red Cross in post-World War II Italy. Brown was married once, and was widowed in 1993.
NICA (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility) is a particle collider complex being constructed by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to perform experiments such as Nuclotron ion beams extracted to a fixed target and colliding beams of ions, ions-protons, polarized protons and deuterons. The projected maximum kinetic energy of the accelerated ions is 4.5 GeV per nucleon, and 12.6 GeV for protons.

NICA setup 

Main elements of the NICA complex are:

 Two-tier injection complex
 Booster
 Superconducting synchrotron Nuclotron
 Collider facility 
 Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD)
 Spin Physics Detector (SPD) 
 Beam transport channels.

LU-20 injection device produces ions of 5 MeV/n energy. It is succeeded by three-staged Light Ion Linac (LILAc) that is capable of light particles acceleration up 7 MeV/n energy, 13 MeV proton acceleration section and a  20 MeV superconducting HWR proton accelerating section.

Heavy-Ion Linac (HILAc), conceived in 2016 by the JINR-Bevatech collaboration, accelerates heavy gold ions up to the energy of 3.2 MeV/n with beam intensity of 2×109 particles per pulse, and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The gold ions are injected from a JNIR-made KRION superconducting electron-string heavy ion source.

The Booster, a superconducting synchrotron, accumulates, cools and further accelerates heavy ions to 600 MeV/n energy. The booster's circumference is 211 meters, its magnetic structure is mounted inside the yoke of the Nuclotron. The Booster is supposed to ensure ultrahigh vacuum of 10−11 Torr.

The Nuclotron to be used in NICA was constructed in 1987–1992. It is the world's first synchrotron based on fast cycling electromagnets of the 'window frame' type with superconducting coil.

The collider is made of two identical 503-meter long storage rings with MPD and SPD placed in the middle of the opposite straight sections. Magnetic rigidity is up to 45 Tm, residual gas pressure in the beam chamber is below 10−10 Torr, maximum field in the dipole magnets – 1.8 T, kinetic energy of gold nuclei – 1.0 to 4.5 GeV/n. The beams are combined and separated in the vertical plane. Upon passing the section bringing them together, the particle bunches in the upper and lower rings travel along a common straight trajectory toward each other to collide at MPD and SPD. Single-aperture lenses are installed along the final focus sections to provide that both beams are focused at SPD and MPD.

MPD facility is designed to study hadron matter at high temperatures and densities, where nucleons "melt" releasing their constituent quarks and gluons and forming a new state, the quark-gluon plasma.

SPD facility allows to collide the polarized beams of protons and deuterons to study the particle spin physics.

Construction 
By 2013, an international tender for scientific equipment supply was completed selecting five core suppliers. Up to 2019, most of the equipment has been delivered and mounted. First tests began in late 2019. The construction that was initially scheduled to end in 2016 is now, as of 2020, to be accomplished by 2022.

The novel is set in the distant future as a group of space travellers, marooned in an inhospitable planetary system, attempt to terraform a moon and create a sufficient civilisation on it to refuel their ship so they can continue to their original destination.

Plot introduction
A couple of centuries from the present, artificial intelligences and nanotechnology are in widespread use in the Solar System and in some cases have caused disasters. Some people do not trust these technologies and plan a simpler life in a distant planetary system, where they plan to terraform a planet called Ymir. Once Ymir is habitable, they will abandon use of all advanced technology. Three sleeper ships leave the Solar System bound for Ymir, using suspended animation to keep the crew and settlers alive during the sub light-speed journey. While in transit, all communication with the Solar System ends; by implication, human civilisation has fallen. The lead ship, John Glenn, is crippled by a design flaw en route, and uses all its antimatter fuel to reach the nearest star system, Apollo. It warns the other two ships, which can correct the flaw, but there is no word from them about whether they reach Ymir.

The John Glenn creates a substantial moon around the gas giant Harlequin by colliding several smaller moons together, and give it an atmosphere, seas, and the beginnings of an ecosystem. This takes 60,000 years, with almost all the passengers of the ship in hibernation during the entire time. The person in charge of creating and terraforming the new moon, Selene, is Gabriel.

Apart from a brief prologue, the novel begins as the second generation of people born on Selene approach adulthood.

Plot summary

Gabriel is teaching a group of moon-born teenagers about agriculture. Rachel is one of these; she passes her exams and is selected by Gabriel to become a leader of the moon-born. Andrew is another; he fails his exams because he plays a practical joke on Rachel. Gabriel takes Rachel to the John Glenn. As the first moon-born to visit the ship, she arouses hostility from some of the leaders there. She learns that there are three classes amongst the space travelers: five are High Council, who rule until Ymir is reached; some dozens are Council, including Gabriel, and have extended privileges; and the remaining "Earth-born" are colonists, many of them not having been unfrozen since leaving Earth and with few rights. She also learns to use the vast repository of knowledge in the ship's library, and makes contact with the AI "Astronaut" who is kept severely restricted because the High Council doesn't trust high technology. Rachel comes to realise that when the moon-born have helped restock the ship with antimatter the John Glenn will continue on to Ymir without them, leaving them on a moon that can only sustain life for a century or two.

Gabriel decides there is no immediate need for him and Rachel to return to Selene, and that as a leader Rachel would be most useful with the longer lifespan that is conferred by the suspended animation process, and has himself and Rachel frozen for a year. Problems with radiation flares intervene, and without Gabriel to stand up for her, they are left frozen for twenty years. Rachel returns to Selene to find her best friend killed in an accident, her boyfriend married and with children almost her own age, and her remaining friends more than twice as old as she is. She also realizes that the moon-born are being treated as slaves, with Earth-born as overseers. The moon-born must develop the technological infrastructure to refine antimatter, but there are major risks involved in the refining which could destroy the population of Selene.

Rachel becomes a teacher of the next generation of moon-born. She teaches them what she is supposed to, but she also includes concepts from Earth history that she learns from the library and Astronaut - concepts such as democracy and passive resistance. She has a few friends among Council, and Astronaut is able to conceal her communications with them from other Council and High Council. Andrew (a childhood enemy) plays a more active role in stirring up rebellion, but the moon-born have no power to change their role. The Council notices the passive resistance and their members begin carrying weapons. Some years later, one of the ship's boats crash lands on Selene and is abandoned there. It has sufficient electronics to house an AI, and Rachel's Council friends make a copy of Astronaut there, Vassal, unknown to High Council.

Ten years after Rachel was unfrozen, an accident leads to a Council member shooting one of the moon-born. Andrew leads a revolt and takes a Council member hostage. The rebellion is halted by a flare which requires everyone to shelter together, and by Rachel's heroic intervention. In the wake of the rebellion, a new understanding is reached between the moon-born and the High Council. They will work more as equals, and the refinement of the antimatter will take place at a safe distance from Selene. The travellers will leave more technology behind when they leave (including the copy of Astronaut) so Selene can survive. This is at a cost of delaying their departure significantly. Gabriel decides he will remain on Selene when John Glenn departs.

A final, short, section of the novel sums up the next two hundred years, with the antimatter refined, the flare problem on Selene permanently dealt with, and John Glenn preparing for departure. Periods of suspended animation keep Rachel and Gabriel young.

There is room for a sequel, dealing with either or both of the futures of John Glenn and Ymir, and of Selene.

Samuel Ross Hay (1865 – 1944) was an American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, elected in 1922.

Born 15 October 1865 in Decaturville, Decatur County, Tennessee, he was the son of the Rev. William and Martha (England) Hay.  His grandfather was an influential local preacher.

The Hays moved to Texas about 1881. Samuel attended Centenary College, Southwestern University, and Southern College, Lakeland, Florida.  He was licensed to preach in 1886, joining the North Texas Annual Conference of the M.E. Church, South in 1887.  Prior to his election to the Episcopacy, Hay was a pastor and a presiding elder.

He was elected Bishop 16 May 1922 and placed in charge of all American Southern Methodist Episcopal Mission work in China. Returning to the United States in 1924, he resided in several episcopal areas in the south and west of the country and assisted in the development of the Methodist Church in Mexico.

On June 26, 1928, he offered the opening invocation at the 1928 Democratic National Convention in Houston.

Hay died on 4 February 1944 in Houston, Texas.

The T.123 standard specifies that T.120 protocols use network port 1503 when communicating over TCP/IP.

Components
HMT Limited, formerly Hindustan Machine Tools Limited, is an Indian state-owned manufacturing company under the control of the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India. It was founded in 1953 as a machine tool manufacturing company, diversifying into watches, tractors, printing machinery, metal forming presses, die casting and plastic processing machinery, and CNC systems and bearings. HMT is headquartered at Bangalore. 

The watch making division, HMT Watches, opened in 1961. During the 1970s and 1980s HMT was the largest supplier of wrist watches in India, with popular styles including Janata and Pilot. The division closed in 2016, largely due to mismanagement leading to heavy losses. In the same year, the Government of India also shut down HMT Chinar Watches Ltd., HMT Bearings, and HMT Tractors. HMT Machine Tools Limited still manufactures industrial machines and tools with a work force of around 2,500 in six manufacturing units situated at Bangalore (Mother unit), Kochi, Hyderabad (2 units), Pinjore and Ajmer. These mostly serve India's defence, government and educational institutions.

HMT's wholly owned subsidiaries include HMT Machine Tools Limited and HMT International Limited. HMT also holds a majority stake in Praga Tools Limited (51%).

History 
Hindustan Machine Tools was incorporated in 1953 by the Government of India as a machine tool manufacturing company.  Over the years, HMT diversified into watches, tractors, printing machinery, metal forming presses, die casting and plastic processing machinery, and CNC systems and bearings. HMT is headquartered in Bengaluru (Bangalore).

Technology was absorbed in all product groups through collaborations with world-renowned manufacturers and further strengthened by continuous in-house R&D.

Today, HMT consists of six subsidiaries under the ambit of a holding company, which also manages the tractor business directly.

HMT Limited took over Praga Tools Limited as one of its subsidiaries 1988. Praga Tools Limited was established in May 1943 as Praga Tools Corporation Limited to manufacture machine tools with its headquarters at Secunderabad. It was renamed as Praga Tools Limited in 1963. It is mainly involved in the manufacturing of machine tools, including CNC machines.

Watch division 

HMT set up a watch manufacturing factory in Bangalore in collaboration with Citizen Watch, a Japanese company, in 1961. The first batch of mechanical (hand wound) wrist watches manufactured here was released by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. The most popular mechanical watch was HMT Janata. Other mechanical watch styles included HMT Pilot, HMT Jhalak (Semi Skeletal), HMT Sona, HMT Braille.

In 1972, HMT expanded its watch manufacturing capacity with a set up alongside the Bangalore Factory to manufacture additional watches. In 1975, the watch factory at Bangalore was further expanded to manufacture main spring, hair spring and shock absorber components. HMT set up additional manufacturing facilities to produce watch components sets at Tumkur in 1978 and at Ranibagh in 1985. The factory at Tumkur was partially converted to manufacture quartz analog watches in collaboration with Citizen. To cater to the niche market, a specialised watch case manufacturing facility was set up at Bangalore in 1983.

Since 1985, HMT Watches had been involved in making floral clocks, solar clocks, international clocks and tower locks, most popular among them being the garden clock in Bangalore. In the year 2000, HMT Watch Business group was re-structured as HMT Watches Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of HMT Limited.

In September 2014, the Government of India shut down HMT operations in a phased manner. By late 2016, the website for HMT watches was taken down.

Takeover 
In September 2016, the Government of India closed some divisions of HMT: HMT Watches Ltd, HMT Bearings, HMT Tractors, and HMT Chinar Watches Ltd. The main reasons were that the company was making losses for more than a decade. During 2012–13, the company had losses of ₹242 crore on revenues of only ₹11 crore. In contrast, competitor Titan's watch business reported sales of ₹1,675 crore during the same year. The government also tried restructuring it in 1999 to improve its finances but the company continued to make losses. While in the 1980s several new companies entered the market with newer designs and more modern production techniques, HMT is said to have been hobbled by slow decision making and was unable to compete. Machine tools divisions of HMT in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kochi (Kalamassery) are still operational and catering industrial and defence sectors of India and abroad. The Government of India is mulling takeover of HMT by Ordnance Factory Board.

Operating units 

HMT Limited had 18 manufacturing units. The constituent subsidiaries are given below while the holding company retains the tractors business group.

HMT's tractor business commenced its operations in 1971 in technical collaboration with Zetor through a licensing deal with Motokov, the export trading arm of Czechoslovakia. HMT started the operation with the manufacture of the 25 HP Zetor 2511 tractor at the manufacturing plant in Pinjore, Haryana state. Over the years, it has developed tractors ranging from 25 HP to 75 HP.

Machine tools divisions of HMT is still continuing its operations and introducing state of the art technologies in Indian industrial market. The Kochi unit has entered manufacturing equipments for Indian Naval defence sector by manufacturing Directing Gear systems.
Ashburton Forks, formerly known as Spreadeagle, is a defined locality on the Canterbury Plains between the forks of the Ashburton / Hakatere Rivers and within the Ashburton District of the Canterbury Province of New Zealand's South Island. It is approximately 50 km west of Ashburton and about 17 km from the foot of the Southern Alps.

Early settlers
A hotel was established there in the late 1870s and, in 1880, was owned by a Mr Philip Tesch. William Campbell (settler), blacksmith by trade, of Oakfield Demesne, County Donegal established a blacksmith business next to the hotel in 1882 and purchased the nearby Spreadeagle Farm with his wife Mary (née Falloon). The hotel and blacksmith shop burnt down in 1892. William Campbell died a few weeks later from consumption. William Campbell Jnr, son of William and Mary Campbell, continued to work the Spreadeagle Farm until his death in 1936. Mary Campbell was postmistress at Spreadeagle/Ashburton Forks until 1928. She died in 1932 and is buried in the nearby town of Methven.

In basketball, a turnover occurs when a team loses possession of the ball to the opposing team before a player takes a shot at their team's basket. This can result from a player getting the ball stolen, stepping out of bounds, having a pass intercepted, committing a violation (such as double dribble, traveling, shot clock violation, three-second violation or five-second violation), or committing an offensive foul (including personal, flagrant, and technical fouls).

According to Boston Globe sportswriter Bob Ryan, the concept of the turnover was first formulated by his colleague Jack Barry. Turnovers were first officially recorded in the American Basketball Association (ABA) during the 1967–68 season. The NBA began tracking team turnovers during the 1973-74 season and started tracking turnovers for individual players during the 1977–78 season subsequent to the NBA-ABA merger. The WNBA has recorded turnovers since its inaugural season in 1997.

Records

NBA 
The record for the most turnovers in an NBA game is shared by Jason Kidd and John Drew. Kidd committed 14 turnovers against the New York Knicks on November 17, 2000 while playing for the Phoenix Suns. Drew committed 14 turnovers against the New Jersey Nets on March 1, 1978 while playing for the Atlanta Hawks. The record for most turnovers in an NBA playoff game was 13, set by James Harden on May 27, 2015 while playing for the Houston Rockets against the Golden State Warriors.

LeBron James holds the regular season and playoff records for most career turnovers with 4,966 in the regular season and 1,015 in the playoffs. Russell Westbrook holds the record for highest career turnover average in the regular season with 4.1 turnovers per game.

WNBA 
The record for the most turnovers by a WNBA team in one game is 33. The record for the most turnovers by a WNBA player per season is held by Ticha Penicheiro, who committed 135 turnovers in 1999. The career record for the most turnovers by a WNBA player is held by Sue Bird has the most turnovers in the WNBA with 1,370.
Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 2 (VMAQ-2) was a United States Marine Corps electronic warfare squadron in service from 1952 to 2019. It was the last squadron flying the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler.

Mission
Its mission was to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commander by conducting airborne electronic warfare, day or night, under all weather conditions during expeditionary, joint, or combined operations. The squadron was based at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina and fell under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 14 (MAG-14) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW).

History
VMAQ-2's predecessor squadrons flew various electronic warfare aircraft, including the AD-5 Skyraider, the EF-10 Skyknight, the RF-8 Crusader, the RF-4B Phantom II, and the EA-6A Intruder. VMC-2 was the original composite squadron (combined aerial photographic reconnaissance and electronic warfare capability) in Marine Corps aviation. It was commissioned at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point on September 15, 1952 evolving from the former Airborne Early Warning and Electronic Counter Measures section of the Wing Headquarters Squadron. On December 1, 1955, the squadron was redesignated as VMCJ-2 after former Marine Photographic Squadron 2 (VMJ-2) was decommissioned and joined VMC-2, and became VMCJ-2 (Marine Composite Jamming Squadron 1).  As 1955 was also the year Playboy magazine was first published, it soon followed that the squadron adopted the Playboy name and logo with their permission.  In 1962, VMCJ-2 provided electronic and photographic intelligence during the Cuban Missile Crisis that enabled President Kennedy to make key decisions that would lead to the removal of Soviet military equipment from Cuba. 
In 1964 VMCJ-2 participated in Operation Steel Pike, the largest amphibious training exercise in history. The unit sailed from Morehead City, NC to the Naval Base at Rota, Spain and flew both photographic and electronic warfare missions during the exercise.

Vietnam War

Less than three years after the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis, some of the same VMCJ-2 aircrews deployed with VMCJ-1 to Vietnam and applied their lessons learned against Cuba as the EF-10Bs began to provide ECM support for air strikes against North Vietnamese targets. Beginning in the Spring of 1966 the squadron began sending Marines to join VMCJ-1 in Vietnam for 13-month tours. In late November 1965, VMCJ-2 received the first EA-6A Electric Intruder. With the rapidly escalating North Vietnamese air defenses this new EW aircraft was anxiously awaited by VMCJ-1 still flying the outdated EF-10B Skyknights, However, the initial EW systems delivered with the new aircraft proved unsuitable for the mission without some major modifications. Given the urgency, the decision was made to make the modifications by a contractor team on-site at VMCJ-2. The success of this effort was due to the dedicated support of VMCJ-2 personnel who worked tirelessly to get the aircraft ready for deployment to Vietnam. 

During this same time period the squadron received the first of its RF-4Bs and for several months the squadron was flying four different aircraft types. In October, 1966 VMCJ-2 sent six EA-6As with full maintenance capability to Danang, Vietnam as a VMCJ-1 replacement cadre. The squadron would continue to provide replacement aircrews and updated aircraft to VMCJ-1 in Vietnam.

In 1971 the squadron deployed the first EA-6A detachment aboard  for a Mediterranean cruise that lasted 10 months with cross decking to  and . On April 13, 1972 the squadron diverted an EA-6A detachment that was scheduled to deploy on the Saratoga in the Mediterranean to WESTPAC to join VMCJ-1 at NAS Cubi Point. The VMCJ-2 detachment operated in concert with VMCJ-1 to support strikes against North Vietnam under Operation Linebacker that ended with the release of the U.S. POWs early in 1973.

Cold War sea service 
After its re-designation in 1975, VMAQ-2 deployed detachments of EA-6A Electric Intruder aircraft [designated Detachments Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie] and EA-6B Prowler aircraft [designated Detachments Xray, Yankee, and Zulu] on a continuous basis in support of Marine forces in the Western Pacific and in support of Fleet Commanders on aircraft carriers, including lengthy deployments on the , , , and . In 1977, the squadron transitioned to the EA-6B Prowler with the Improved Capability (ICAP) EW suite. In 1986, a detachment of the squadron participated in U.S. raids against Libya as part of Operation El Dorado Canyon.

The Persian Gulf War and Post-War Reorganization

In August 1990, VMAQ-2 deployed Detachments Yankee and Zulu to Shaikh Isa Air Base , in southern Bahrain in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, flying nearly 500 combat sorties in a six-week period.  Detachment X-Ray was already forward deployed to MCAS Iwakuni (1st Marine Aircraft Wing) for their routine six-month WestPac tour but would end up remaining on deployment for a total of 410 days - more than double their scheduled time - the longest continuous deployment in Marine aviation history during peacetime.

On 1 July 1992, VMAQ-2, the largest tactical squadron in Marine Aviation, was reorganized into three squadrons: VMAQ-1 "Banshees", VMAQ-2 "Playboys", and VMAQ-3 "Moondogs". In 1993, outside pressure forced the Marine Corps to direct the squadron to change their name and logo from "Playboys" to something more politically correct.  After several ideas were rejected the squadron chose "Panthers" as the new name and began using the logo (with permission) of the National Football League's Carolina Panthers. VMAQ-2 later changed from the "Panthers" to the current name "Death Jesters". Even with the name changes the squadron continues to use "Playboy" Bunny patches and paint jobs on their five aircraft. Even the CY tail code was fashioned on some in the shape of a bunny head (designed and implemented by VMAQ-2's MMCO at the time, Captain Ross Meglathery).

The Balkans

VMAQ-2’s next assignment led them to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in March 1996 in support of Operation Decisive Endeavor. This operation tasked VMAQ-2 with missions over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Specifically, VMAQ-2 Prowlers provided Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) support to British Harriers performing reconnaissance flights over weapons containment sites in these two areas of operation.  In 1997, VMAQ-2 once again deployed to Aviano Air Base. However, this time it was in support of Operation Deliberate Guard. VMAQ-2 was tasked with flying missions over Bosnia to cover the Bosnian elections.  On February 3, 1998 a USMC Grumman EA-6B Prowler, BuNo 163045, callsign "Easy 0-1" from VMAQ-2, struck a cable supporting a gondola in Cavalese, Italy. The cable was severed and 20 people in the cabin plunged over 80 metres to their deaths. The plane had wing and tail damage but was able to return to the base.  It was the squadron's first major mishap in over 60,000 flight hours spanning nearly fifteen years of worldwide operations.
 
In February 1999, VMAQ-1, VMAQ-2, VMAQ-3, and VMAQ-4 received the order to again deploy to Aviano Air Base in Italy in support of Operation Noble Anvil and possible subsequent combat operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After diplomatic attempts to resolve the Kosovo crisis failed, Operation Allied Force began. VMAQ-2 launched day and night sorties to provide jamming and HARM support to U.S. and NATO missions. VMAQ-2 also provided support for armed reconnaissance missions, day and night battlefield air interdiction strikes, and combat search and rescue efforts of downed allied aircrew. When Operation Allied Force came to an end, VMAQ-2 had flown 2151.5 combat hours, 464 combat sorties, and fired 57 High speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARM) against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Global War on Terrorism

In February 2003, VMAQ-2 deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, initially in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM and then Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. VMAQ-2 logged over 1000 combat hours in under 60 days during the invasion of Iraq.

VMAQ-2 deployed to Tallil Air Base, Iraq, for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM II from July 2004 through January 2005 and became the first Prowler squadron to operate from Iraqi soil. The squadron logged over 2000 mishap-free combat hours and attained 10,000 mishap free flight hours during the same period. VMAQ-2 was subsequently chosen as the Marine Corps Aviation Association 2005 Prowler squadron of the year

In January 2006, VMAQ-2 deployed to Al Asad Airbase, Iraq in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM 05-07. VMAQ-2 flew 691 combat missions for 3286.7 combat flight hours and supported 975 Joint Tactical Air Requests (JTARS). This rigorous operational tempo resulted in four times the normal airframe utilization rate.

In July 2007, VMAQ-2 returned to Al Asad, Iraq in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM 06-08. During the deployment, VMAQ-2 flew 821 combat missions for a total of 4423.0 combat flight hours while supporting Coalition ground forces. This sustained tempo led not only to the highest utilization rate for any Prowler squadron but also for any Type/Model/Series in the Marine Corps.

On May 19, 2010, VMAQ-2 Marines deployed to Camp McCool had to repel a Taliban attack in which two of the Marines who were involved in the firefight were injured. 

In November 2018, VMAQ-2 returned from its final deployment and the final deployment of any USMC Prowler squadron. The squadron was decommissioned on March 8, 2019.

St. Johns Country Day School is an independent, coeducational private college preparatory school founded in 1953 in Orange Park, Florida, U.S.. It offers a PK–12 education, including a preschool, an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school, and maintains an enrollment of about 450 students each year.

History 
St. Johns Country Day School was founded by Dr. Edwin Paul Heinrich and his wife Dorothea Aldine Heinrich on September 14, 1953. The couple moved from Washington, D.C. to Jacksonville, Florida in order to found the first private school in Clay County. The school was named after the St. Johns River, a nearby geographical landmark. The first location of the school was the second floor of a public building at the modern day location of  Moosehaven. The first class consisted of 26 students from grades 1-10.By 1956, the lease on the building was expiring, so the Heinrichs purchased a 26-acre property further south on July 31, 1956. Ground was broken on construction on February 27, 1957, and the new building opened on August 21, 1957. Rod Fisher, longtime science teacher and landmark of the St. Johns campus, was hired in 1967 out of Catawba College. Dr. Heinrich served as the school's headmaster until his retirement in 1970. He was succeeded by Patrick Mackin in September 1970. On October 14, 1976, faulty electrical wiring caught fire and burned down nearly half of the school, leaving classrooms inoperable and causing smoke damage to the library.

Academics

The Goodricke-Pigott Observatory is a private astronomical observatory in Tucson, Arizona. It was formally dedicated on October 26, 1996, and observations began that evening with imaging of Comet Hale–Bopp.

The observatory is named after John Goodricke and Edward Pigott, two late-eighteenth century astronomers who lived in York, England.

Observatory telescopes 

The observatory opened with a Celestron C14, 0.35-meter aperture, f/11 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. This instrument has been upgraded with a new optics lens and a new clock drive, and an ST-4 star tracker was attached to the telescope's side to correct a two-minute, ten-arc second periodic motional error. There is another telescope dubbed MOTESS (Moving Object and Transient Event Search System) which is essentially a giant camera aimed at the sky.

Sint Maartensbrug is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Schagen, and lies about 14 km northwest of Heerhugowaard.

History 
The village was first mentioned in 1613 as "Sinte Maertensbrugge", and means "bridge (over the Groote Sloot on the road to) Sint Maarten". Sint Maartensbrug is a cross shaped village which appeared shortly after the area was poldered between 1596 and 1597. It consists of a linear settlement along the Groote Sloot and another linear settlement along the road.

The Dutch Reformed church is a wide aisleless church with wooden tower which was built in 1696. The polder mill N-G or Noorder G was probably built in the second half of the 17th century. It was in service until 1958 when it was replaced by a Diesel powered pumping station. Between 1969 and 1972, the windmill was restored and is frequently in service on a voluntary basis.

Labyrinth is an archaeological mystery English-language novel written by Kate Mosse set both in the Middle Ages and present-day France. It was published in 2005.

It divides into two main storylines that follow two protagonists, Alaïs (from the year 1209) and Alice (in the year 2005).  The two stories occur in a shared geography and intertwine. The novel relies heavily on historical events such as the massacre at Béziers and the Crusade against the Cathars in Occitania, now the South of France, from around 1200. The text itself features many Occitan and French quotes.  Ultimately the story becomes a quest for the Holy Grail.

In the 2006 British Book Awards, Labyrinth was awarded Best Read of the Year. According to The Sunday Times, it was the second best selling book in the United Kingdom in 2006, after The Da Vinci Code, selling about 865,400 copies in paperback. The Guardian ranked it the number one bestseller for 2006. An extract from the novel was used in the Scottish Qualifications Authority's 2009 Standard Grade English General close reading paper.

Plot 
When Dr Alice Tanner, who works as a volunteer at the archaeological site of Pic de Soularac, in France, discovers two skeletons in a long-hidden cave in the hillside, she unearths a link with an horrific and brutal  past. However, it is not just the sight of the shattered bones that makes her uneasy; there is an overwhelming sense of evil in the tomb that Alice finds hard to shake off, even in the bright French sunshine. Puzzled by the words carved inside the chamber and the representation of a labyrinth, she finds an exact representation of it on the underside of the ring she found in the cave.

Alice has an uneasy feeling that she has disturbed something that was meant to remain hidden. She finds a connection to the nightmares she had been having since childhood and discovers that the cave was related to her past.

Eight hundred years ago, on the night before a brutal civil war ripped apart Languedoc, three books were entrusted to Alaïs, a young herbalist and healer, the daughter of the steward of Carcassona. Although she cannot understand the symbols and diagrams the books contain, Alaïs knows her destiny lies in protecting their secret at all costs. The books contain the secrets to the Holy Grail. Alice later discovers that she is Alaïs's descendant.

Television adaptation 
A television adaptation of the novel adapted by Adrian Hodges and directed by Christopher Smith was released in 2012.
Retail media is marketing to consumers at or near their point of purchase, or point of choice between competing brands or products. Common techniques include in-store advertising, online advertising, sampling, loyalty cards and coupons or vouchers.

The planning and use of retail media is a key component in the delivery of shopper marketing campaigns.

Retail media channels have become established as important for promoting goods and services at or near or even further beyond the points of purchase and consumption. Retail media is now being taken more seriously by most traditional media agencies.

Retail media originated as media available within the retail environment. This has now developed into a media discipline in its own right as new retail media channels have been added. Retail media now reaches outside the retail environment to encompass media channels such loyalty program marketing, coupons and door drops, fleet media (retailer's fleet vehicles, etc.).

Though many retail media channels are found inside the retailer's store/environment, the media channels themselves are not always "owned" or operated by retailers. Many retail media channels are operated independently by specialist media companies who also manage other media outside the retail environment.

Context and targeting
Retail media channels are to a large extent defined by the context of the retailer. The majority of retail media channels reach their audience at or near the point of purchase or point of choice. Research suggests media placed at or near the points of choice/purchase can have a significant impact on purchasing decisions (PoS).1 Media owners and agencies have learnt more in recent years about the value of retail media channels.

There is potential for conflict of interest between the retailer selling the media and the CPG/FMCG buying the media, which is why retailers often engage a third-party media owner to operate and sell media space on their behalf.

Challenges
 Audience measures: There are several methods for evaluating the audience for retail media, whether total footfall, segmented audiences or sales uplift attributed to retail media channels.
 Buying process: Dependent on the retailer, product, sales cycle and retail media channel, and other concerns, there are different media sales cycles to fit the particular requirements.

Agencies
Due to the specialized nature of retail media programs, advertisers are increasingly turning to dedicated retail media agencies to facilitate shopper-targeted campaigns.

Retail media agencies help connect retailers such as Walmart and Sam's Club with brands that are interested in presenting their message to consumers while they are navigating the path to purchase.

In the UK, one of the first agencies to specialise in this space was RMI (Retail Marketing International), who developed a "software operating system" known as BASE; a platform used by retailers and CPGs to run their shopper marketing. Other shopper marketing agencies in the UK include: GIG Retail, Result Marketing, and Capture Marketing.
Traditional advertising agencies are beginning to understand the power of shopper marketing, in light of the overall share of traditional marketing budgets being directed more towards "shopper" and "digital" media, away from less efficient and less quantifiable media such as TV, local press, and radio.

Networks
Retail media networks are channels spanning individual retailers or a multitude of retailers. They can range from static posters, point-of-sale material, audio, visual or digital materials, and many things in between. Networks can therefore provide narrowcast and broadcast audience buying solutions. As shoppers spend time in stores, it becomes difficult for them to avoid in-store advertising and this can benefit advertisers, who not only can ensure their campaigns are seen, but that they can also be acted upon, especially if the advertised product is available in the store.

Retail media networks now offer accountability in providing audience measurement techniques in the same way as traditional broadcast or print media.
Blaenwern is a Welsh Christian hymn tune composed by William Penfro Rowlands (1860–1937), during the Welsh revival of 1904–1905. It was first published in Henry H. Jones' Cân a Moliant (1915).

The metre of the tune is 8.7.8.7.D (alternating lines of eight and seven syllables) in F major or G major key, or occasionally A flat major.

The tune is named after Blaenwern Farm near Tufton, Pembrokeshire, where Rowlands sent his son from Porth to stay with friends of the family to convalesce as it was thought the fresh air would assist his recovery: he named the tune in honour of them.

In the United Kingdom Blaenwern has come to be used as the prevalent setting for the hymn Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, but also in other settings including the Welsh Deued Dyddiau O Bob Cymysg by William Williams Pantycelyn, and Calon Lân by Daniel James. It also became familiar to a wider audience through the Billy Graham crusades when it was used as a setting to What a Friend We Have in Jesus.

As a setting for Love Divine it is a popular choice at English weddings and was voted as one of Britain's ten favourite hymns in October 2005. Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, set to Blaenwern, was sung at the wedding blessing of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles and it was also selected as one of three hymns sung at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the others being Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, set to Cwm Rhondda, and Jerusalem.

The tune was also used for Love Divine, All Loves Excelling at the funeral of former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in 2013, the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in 2018 and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.
Valentin Ivanovich Varennikov (December 15, 1923 – May 6, 2009) was a Soviet/Russian Army general and politician, best known for being one of the planners and leaders of the Soviet–Afghan War, as well as one of the instigators of the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt.

Early life
Valentin Varennikov was born to a poor Cossack family in Krasnodar. His father, who fought in the Russian Civil War, graduated from the Moscow industrial institute and was a manager. His mother died in 1930 when he was seven. In 1938, Varennikov lived in Armavir, where he graduated from high school in 1941.

Military career

World War II
In August 1941, Varennikov was drafted by the Armavir city military registration and enlistment office into the ranks of the Red Army. He attended the Cherkassk Infantry School, which was then evacuated to Sverdlovsk following the start of Operation Barbarossa. From October, the first military recruitment began to train. After an accelerated graduation from the school in the summer of 1942, Varennikov was among the few graduates to be appointed the commander of a training platoon in the reserve rifle brigade stationed in Gorky, and only in October 1942 he ended up on the Stalingrad Front as commander of a mortar platoon of 120-mm regimental mortars of the 138th Rifle Division. He fought in the Battle of Stalingrad for 79 days and nights. In November 1942, Varennikov was appointed battery commander, and in December of the same year he participated in the destruction of the encircled units of the German 6th Army commanded by Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus.

In January 1943, he was wounded. After recovering, he returned to duty, enlisted in the operational department of the 35th Guards Rifle Division of the 8th Guards Army. Since March 1943, he was the commander of the mortar battery of the 100th Guards Rifle Regiment, and in the spring of 1944 Varennikov was appointed Deputy Commander of the 100th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 35th Guards Rifle Division of artillery. He participated in the Battle of the Dnieper, and fought for the liberation of Belarus and Poland. When the 8th Guards Army was transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front  Varennikov and his regiment took part in the Operation Bagration. In late July and early August 1944, he entered Polish soil in the Vistula–Oder offensive and fought for the capture of a bridgehead on the Vistula south of Warsaw in Magnuszew. There he was seriously wounded and was treated in a hospital for four months. After his recovery, he returned to the 100th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 35th Guards Rifle Division as deputy regiment commander of artillery, and in mid-January 1945 he participated in the offensive of Soviet troops from the Baltic to the Carpathians. He took part in the battles for the bridgehead in the area of the city of Kustrin on the Oder. In March 1945, Varennikov was wounded for the third time in the battles for Kustrin.

In March 1945, he was assigned as Chief of Artillery of the 101st Guards Rifle Regiment of the 35th Guards Rifle Division. From April to May, Varennikov finished the German–Soviet War in the Battle of Berlin as one of the commanders of the Soviet soldiers who captured the Reichstag.

During the war he was wounded three times and was decorated four times. In June 1945, he took part in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 and immediately before the parade, being the chief of the guard of honor, he received the Victory Banner. He ended the war with the rank of captain.

Post war career
Varennikov stayed in East Germany as an officer of the Soviet troops, stationed there until 1950.

In 1954 he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow. Later he graduated from the General Staff Academy.  In 1960 he became deputy commander of a motor rifle division. From 1962 to 1966 Varennikov commanded the 54th Motor Rifle Division of the Leningrad Military District. In 1964 armed forces inspectors tested the division, and it was awarded as one of the six top divisions of the Ground Forces of the USSR Armed Forces by order of the Minister of Defence. In August 1965 he was enrolled in the General Staff Academy. From 1967 to 1969 he commanded the 26th Army Corps of the Leningrad Military District.

In 1969 Varennikov took charge of the 3rd Shock Army, and in 1971 he was appointed as the First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. On 1973, he became the commander of the  Carpathian Military District. 
From 1979 to 1984, he served as the Head of the Main Operations Directorate and First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR.

Between 1984 and 1985, Varennikov worked with the Soviet military mission in Angola, then in the throes of a bloody civil war. In a sharp contrast with the official policy of only permitting Soviet military advisers to serve in non-combat roles, Varennikov supported allowing the advisers to fight alongside their Angolan allies in the event they came under attack. He was the senior Soviet general officer in Angola during Operation Askari, and personally advised Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos on defensive measures to counter the South African Defence Force's incursion. During the Chernobyl Disaster of 1986, Varennikov was the main organizer of the work of military units in deployment of troops to the location of the catastrophe, to help in recovery efforts.

During the last few years of the Soviet–Afghan War, Varennikov was the personal representative in Kabul of the Soviet Defence Minister and held negotiations with the United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan members who oversaw the pullout from the country of Soviet troops between 1988 and 1989. Varennikov continued to defend the war even after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.

In 1989 General Varennikov was named Commander-in-chief of Ground Forces and Deputy Minister of Defence.

Involvement in the August Coup
In 1991, during the August coup attempt he joined forces opposing Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. After the coup's failure General Varennikov was arrested, tried, and prosecuted for treason together with other coup plotters. He was acquitted by the Supreme Court of Russia in 1994, as the court concluded he had merely followed orders and had acted "only in an interest of preserving and strengthening his country". He was the only member of the group of accused plotters who refused to accept an amnesty.

Later life

In 1995 Varennikov, as a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, was elected deputy of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament. In the Duma Varennikov presided over the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. In 2003 he joined the Rodina bloc as one of its leaders.

In February 2008, Valentin Varennikov was officially accepted as fellow of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (Armenian branch) and member of the International Academy Ararat. He was the president and founder of the International League for Human Dignity and Security, an international NGO present in more than 40 countries.

In May 2005, Varennikov travelled to China and participated in the launch of the Chinese version of his book Man, War and Dream, at the Russian Embassy in Beijing. Although Varennikov has been to China before, he has a deep love for the Chinese people.

In the preface to the Chinese version of the book, he wrote:

"I have five reasons to love China: first, the Chinese people are outstanding people, and China has a long history and culture; second, she has an amazing development rate today; third, the Chinese people have never threatened anyone, but the Chinese people have been brought to them by the aggressors. However, he finally defeated the aggressor and embarked on the road of national independence. Fourth, China is our great neighbor, and China and Russia have traditional friendship. Fifth, the Chinese leaders trained by the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to find the right direction of development in the world economic development system.

Varennikov was one of Russia's most outspoken defenders of Joseph Stalin. During 2008, Varennikov presented the case for Stalin as Russia's greatest historical figure on the Name of Russia television project. Stalin won third place. According to Varennikov: "We became a great country because we were led by Stalin."

Personal life
Varennikov was married to Elena-Olga Tikhonovna (1923-2005). They had two sons. One of his sons, Vladimir Varennikov, is a retired lieutenant general in the Russian Ground Forces, an Afghan war veteran and also a Rodina deputy in the Russian Parliament (Duma).

Valentin Varennikov lived in Moscow, where he died on May 6, 2009, aged 85, at the Main Military Clinical Hospital named after N.N.Burdenko following complications after a complex operation performed in January 2009 at the S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. He is buried with full military honors at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

The National Assembly, also known as the Parliament of Afghanistan or simply as the Afghan Parliament, was the legislature of Afghanistan in various forms from the monarchy, republican, communist and democratic periods between 1931 and 2021. It was a bicameral body, comprising two chambers:
Meshrano Jirga or the House of Elders: an upper house with 102 seats.
Wolesi Jirga or the House of the People: a lower house with 250 seats

According to Chapter Five of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan, "the National Assembly of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as the highest legislative organ was the manifestation of the will of its people and represents the whole nation. Every member of the National Assembly took into judgment the general welfare and supreme interests of all people of Afghanistan at the time of casting their vote".

The parliament was effectively suspended between 1992 and 2005 due to the ongoing war and was reconstituted in 2005 after the collapse of the first Taliban regime. It was dissolved when the Taliban regained control of the country on 15 August 2021, and transferred legislative authority to the Leadership Council. The Taliban did not include the National Assembly and several other agencies of the former government in its first national budget in May 2022. Government spokesman Innamullah Samangani said that due to the financial crisis, only active agencies were included in the budget, and the excluded ones had been dissolved, but noted they could be brought back "if needed".

Duties of the National Assembly
Ratification, modification or abrogation of laws or legislative decrees;
Approval of social, cultural, economic as well as technological development programs;
Approval of the state budget as well as permission to obtain or grant loans;
Creation, modification and or abrogation of administrative units;
Ratification of international treaties and agreements, or abrogation of membership of Afghanistan in them;
Other authorities enshrined in this Constitution.

The Wolesi Jirga (House of People)
The Wolesi Jirga had 250 seats with members directly elected by the people. Sixty-eight women were elected to the seats reserved under the Constitution, while 17 of them were elected in their own right. Each province was given proportionate representation in the Wolesi Jirga according to its population. Each member of the Wolesi Jirga enjoyed a five-year term.

An aspiring candidate for the Wolesi Jirga had to fulfill the following criteria:
Be at least 25 years of age
Be a citizen of Afghanistan
Be registered as a voter
Be running as a representative in only one province
Pay a registration fee of 15,000 Afghanis (approximately US$300) which will be refunded provided the candidate wins at least three percent (3%) of the vote

In addition, no candidate could have been charged with crimes against humanity.

The Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders)

The Meshrano Jirga consisted of a mixture of appointed and elected members (total 102 members). Sixty-eight members were selected by 34 directly elected Provincial Councils, and 34 were appointed by the President. President Karzai's appointments were vetted by an independent UN sponsored election board and included 17 women (50%), as required by the Constitution.

Each provincial council elected one council member to serve in the Jirga (34 members), also each district council (34 members). Representatives of provincial councils served a term of four years, while representatives of district councils served a term of three years. Sebghatulla Mojadeddi was appointed President of Meshrano Jirga.

An aspiring candidate for the Meshrano Jirga had to fulfill the following criteria:
Be at least 35 years of age
Be a citizen of Afghanistan
In addition, no potential member of the Meshrano Jirga could have been charged with crimes against humanity.

New Parliament building 

The National Assembly is located next to the famous Darul Aman Palace in Darulaman, which is the southwestern section of Kabul where many important national institutions are found. The current building for the Assembly was built by India as part of its contribution in the rebuilding of Afghanistan. It was inaugurated in late 2015 by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his guest Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India. The current Parliament was inaugurated on April 26, 2019, after being sworn in by Ghani.

The foundation stone for the new National Assembly Building was laid in August 2005 by the last reigning monarch of Afghanistan, King Zahir, in the presence of Hamid Karzai and  Manmohan Singh. India's Central Public Works Department (CPWD) was the consultant for the project and the contract was awarded to an Indian infrastructure company in 2008. The new Parliament building is corralled in a 100-acre plot in the famous Darulaman section of Kabul. It sits next to two historical landmarks: the Darul Aman Palace and the Tajbeg Palace.

The construction work on the $220 million building was initially slated to be complete by 2012, in 36 months. The deadline, however, was pushed back due to challenging work conditions, shortage of skilled workforce and precarious security environment. More than 500 laborers had worked on the building, most of them Indian nationals. The main attraction of the building is a bronze dome of 32 meter diameter and 17.15 meter height is considered to be the largest dome in Asia. The big dome will cover the assembly hall and the small dome will be over the entrance lobby. In front of the building, there is a water body with nine cascading fountains. Inside the building, a 20-feet fountain, made of green marble imported from Indian city of Udaipur, has been installed.

On December 25, 2015, during a state visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the new Parliament building was inaugurated along with President Ashraf Ghani. Ghani tweeted: "Pleased to welcome PM Modi to Kabul. Though, India & Afghanistan need no introduction, we are bound by a thousand ties... We have stood by each other in the best and worst of times."
The prime minister of Cambodia is the head of government of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The prime minister is also the chairman of the Council of Ministers, and represents the government at home and abroad. Under the current constitution, the prime minister is elected to a five-year term, with no limits imposed on the office. Since 1945, there have been 36 prime ministers, including 4 who served in acting capacity.Constitutionally the prime minister is required to be a member of the National Assembly. He must also gain their approval through a resolution before an official appointment by the King can take place. The traditional swearing-in ceremony takes place at the Royal Palace where the prime minister-elect has to take an oath of office in front of the King and the two Patriarch monks.

The current prime minister of Cambodia is Hun Sen, since 14 January 1985.

Timeline
KRFC (88.9 MHz) is a community-based FM radio station in Fort Collins, Colorado. The station is owned and operated by Public Radio for the Front Range. The station's programming includes music of numerous genres, played by volunteer DJs.  Some news, information and syndicated shows are on the schedule as well.  Although similar in funding strategies to a traditional public radio station, KRFC is not a member of any of the major networks such as NPR or Pacifica.

KRFC has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts, with a signal extending from the Wyoming border to the suburbs of Denver.  The transmitter is on Weld County Route 80 near Route 17 in Severance, Colorado.

History
Public Radio for the Front Range (PRFR) was started by a group of former DJs from KCSU-FM. DJs who were not current students were forced to leave after KCSU-FM's underwriter, Colorado State University, decided to make KCSU-FM solely student-run. In September 1995, PRFR was given IRS 501(C)(3) non-profit status.

By the summer of 1996, PRFR had applied for a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The group wanted to build a station on 88.9 MHz, but were challenged by other broadcasting groups. PRFR then went into negotiations during 1997 with Colorado Christian University to share 88.9 MHz; these negotiations failed. 

By 2000, the group applied for the 89.7 MHz frequency in a low-power jurisdiction; another Christian group applied for the same frequency. After successful negotiations, PRFR came into agreement with the other applicants that the PRFR would receive 88.9 MHz. The agreement was submitted to the FCC on July 7, 2002, who then granted PRFR a construction permit for a 3,000–watt non-commercial radio station. KRFC 88.9 FM Radio Fort Collins began broadcasting on March 1, 2003.

In 2004, KFRC completed the construction and expansion of its studios. Its facilities include three separate studios, all of which have the ability to broadcast live. Volunteers continue to make up the majority of KRFC 88.9 FM Radio Fort Collins' workforce.  In 2022, the station increased its power to 50,000 watts and constructed its own antenna tower.  This gives it a larger area of Colorado able to receive its signal.
Mingo Wilderness is an 8,000 acre (32 km2) U.S. Wilderness Area located in southeastern Missouri in the Mingo National Wildlife Refuge. It was established and governed under the Wilderness Act of 1964. While the public is invited to engage in recreational opportunities such as fishing, hiking, canoeing, and wildlife observation, all uses are primitive and nondestructive and all access is by either foot traffic or nonmotorized boat.

A special auto tour that runs around the perimeter of the Wilderness Area is open on Saturdays and Sundays in April, October, and November.

The following specific activities are permitted in the Wilderness Area:

 Hiking and backpacking:  Most hiking is associated with and used as the means to accomplish other activities such as wildlife observation, berry picking, or fishing. There are no established hiking trails in the Wilderness Area.
 Fishing: Most fishing is done from small boats and canoes or from the bank. Fishing pressure is usually heaviest during the spring and summer months, especially on week-ends. Boat motors are prohibited in the Wilderness Area.
 Wildlife Observation: Wildlife and wild lands observation is a popular activity in the Wilderness Area. Deer, wild turkey, raccoon, migratory birds and other wildlife are readily seen in this area.
 Environmental Education and Interpretation: groups such as school and college classes are allowed to use the Wilderness area for educational purposes.
Clifton is a village on the coast of New South Wales, Australia, between Sydney and Wollongong. Along with nearby Coalcliff, the village began life as a coal-mining centre. It is situated on a narrow area between the sea and the Illawarra escarpment. The electrified South Coast railway line passes through, but the station at Clifton was closed in 1915. It reopened on 1934-07-04 and closed for the last time on 1983-11-27, at the time of double tracking and electrification.

The Sea Cliff Bridge, opened in 2005, restored the connection between Clifton and Coalcliff, broken by frequent rock falls onto this section of the Lawrence Hargrave Drive. The bridge lies parallel to the former "coal cliffs" and offers scenic views of the cliffs, the sea, and surrounding coastline.

History
In 1797, survivors of the Sydney Cove discovered coal in the 'Coal Cliffs'. Clifton was created with the construction of the Coal Cliff Colliery in 1877. It was situated on the southern end of the Stanwell Park Estate owned by surveyor Sir Thomas Mitchell. A number of weatherboard cottages with galvanised iron roofs had been built. The mine officially opened in 1878. In 1880, the School of Arts was established. Thomas Hale, the first mine manager, constructed a  jetty out to sea and a slide down the  cliff. This took coal to Hilda and Herga, two steam colliers built in Glasgow. Hilda struck a reef near Port Hacking in 1893. In 1878 the mine employed 73 men. By 1884 there were 150 miners, and coal production was 51,500 tons annually. Most of the miners lived, with their families, in Clifton. There was a post/telegraph office, school, (opened 1879), and James Farraher's Clifton Inn and in 1884 the press reported near 1000 residents, a large proportion of which worked at the mines. In 1879 a mail service to Bulli was established. 

The mine closed after storms destroyed the jetty and job losses crippled the village. In 1887 the railway line had reached Clifton from Wollongong. Before this time four-horse coaches would travel between Wollongong and Clifton, starting from Wollongong at 5 am. In 1884 an Anglican and a Roman Catholic Church were built. A public hall was built in 1885. In 1887 the railway between Wollongong and Clifton was opened. In 1890 the Coal Cliff Coal and Land Company Ltd took over the colliery. In 1893 the Clifton School was opened. In 1910 the miners at the Coal Cliff Colliery went on strike for ten months. Also in 1910 the school of arts building was built. The strikers supplied some of the required labour for this project. In 1919 additions were made to the Catholic Church and it was blessed in a ceremony on the first of March.

From May 8 to 10, 1972, about sixty miners took over the mine at South Clifton in protest of its closure on May 5, ensuring the mine was reopened for a further period; all workers were returned to the payroll and promised work at other mines after the closure.

The Imperial Hotel was established 1884 by Allan Broadhead as a miners Pub. It closed in November 2002 after the collapse of Lawrence Hargrave Drive (now replaced by the Sea Cliff Bridge). It has now been purchased and restored by Shellharbour Workers Club.
The Homestead Town Hall, also known as the Redlands District Chamber of Commerce, is the original town hall for the Town of Homestead, built in 1917 Homestead, Florida. It is located at 41 North Krome Avenue. On November 7, 1997, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

The building was originally two separate buildings that date to 1917 and 1924, which were subsequently connected. It was the first municipal building in Homestead.  
This property is part of the Homestead Multiple Property Submission.

The Historic Homestead Town Hall Museum is located in Homestead Town Hall.  The museum features photos, artifacts and films about the city's history.
Édson Boaro (born July 3, 1959), best known as Édson or Édson Abobrão, is a former Brazilian football defender.

In his career, he played for Ponte Preta (1978–1984), Corinthians (1984–1989), Palmeiras (1989–1992), Guarani (1992), Noroeste, Paysandu and Remo (1993), Botafogo (1994–1995) and São José do Rio Pardo (1995–1998).

He won the Brazilian Silver Ball Award in 1984, one São Paulo State Championship in 1988 and one Pará State Championship in 1992. With the Brazil national football team he won at the Pan American Games in 1979, was capped 19 times between June 1983 and June 1986, and participated in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

Édson played at right-back in Brazil’s opening two games in the 1986 World Cup in México, when first choice Leandro did not make the trip.  He was injured early in the second game, against Algeria in Guadalajara, and was replaced by the veteran midfielder Falcão.  However, Édson’s injury ultimately led to the début of Josimar, at right-back, for the next game against Northern Ireland. Édson, as luck would have it, never played for Brazil again. Since 1998, he is a coach.
Jean-Baptiste Romane (1807 - 1858) was an early Haitian poet and playwright. 

Romane is best known for his first work, the lyrical poem Hymne à l'Indépendance (Hymn to Independence). When France announced its official recognition of Haitian independence, Romane's poem was sung at the subsequent national celebration. His works were typically historic or patriotic; many celebrated the heroes of the Haitian Revolution. For one poem, Vers à la France, Romane was awarded a gold medallion by the French government.

The village itself only has a population of 312. The community includes the small settlements of Llanelian-yn-Rhos, Trofarth, Dolwen , Bryn-y-maen, and Dawn.

Etymology 
The first part of the name of the village comes from the Middle English word bedhus, meaning "prayer house", which became betws in Welsh. Bettws Newydd translates therefore to the new prayer house.

Sport
Betws yn Rhos is home to a football team who play in the Clwyd Football League.
Betws yn Rhos enjoyed a good first season 2007/08 but have since been unable to recapture their form in the 2008/09  In the summer of 2011 Craig Hughes took over Betws yn Rhos FC, to become their 4th manager in the last 5 seasons.

In cryptography, Nimbus is a block cipher invented by Alexis Machado in 2000. It was submitted to the NESSIE project, but was not selected.

The algorithm uses a 128-bit key. It operates on blocks of 64 bits and consists of 5 rounds of
encryption. The round function is exceedingly simple. In each round the block is XORed with a subkey, the order of its bits is reversed, and then it is multiplied mod 264 by another subkey, which is forced to be odd.

History
Ugo-Iwaya Station opened on October 16, 1922 as a station on the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) Rikuusai Line. It was switched to the control of the JGR Uetsu Main Line on April 20, 1924. The JGR became the JNR (Japan National Railway) after World War II. With the privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company. A new station building was completed on March 8, 2000. The building also includes offices for the Chamber of Commerce of the former town of Ōuchi, Akita.

Surrounding area
Geof Motley OAM (born 3 January 1935) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach who played for South Australian National Football League (SANFL) side Port Adelaide. Motley was born near Alberton Oval, the home ground of the Port Adelaide Football Club, and grew up supporting Port Adelaide.

Port Adelaide (1954-1966) 
For eight seasons (1959–1966) Motley captained the then dominating team of the League, including a stint as captain-coach from 1959 to 1961.  He was the only man to appear in all nine of the Magpies premiership teams between 1954 and 1965. Motley played a total of 258 games for Port between 1953 and 1966 and also represented South Australia on 28 occasions. 

During his career, Motley was never dropped from the league team and was never reported. During his time in league football, not being reported for foul play was a rare thing for a player as at the time having a certain amount of mongrel or thuggery was seen a common thing.

Motley was named Port Adelaide's best and fairest player in 1958, 1959, 1963, and 1965; and won the Magarey Medal in 1964.

Motley was captain-coach of the Magpies 1959 premiership winning side.

North Adelaide coach (1967-1969) 
Geof Motley went on to coach North Adelaide in 1967-1969, taking the club to 3rd, 3rd, and 5th. They won the minor premiership in 1967 but were unable to compete successfully against Sturt and Port Adelaide in the major round. Under Motley's tutelage, Australian Football Hall of Fame Legend Barrie Robran debuted and won his first Magarey Medal.

After football 
Since retiring, Motley has been bestowed with several honours including life membership of Port Adelaide and the SANFL, and membership of the South Australian Football Hall of Fame and the Australian Football Hall of Fame. In 2001 Motley was named on a half-back flank in Port Adelaide's 'Greatest Team of All Time'.

Personal life 
Geof was married to Gaynor who played for Australia in basketball (competing in the first world championships in Rio de Janeiro) and netball, and represented South Australia in softball until her death on 21 February 1999.

Their son, Peter Motley played for rival SANFL club Sturt and Victorian Football League (VFL) club Carlton, while Motley's second cousin is former Port Adelaide captain Warren Tredrea.

Note: "Geof" is the correct spelling of his name.
Dalchhut is a Bangladeshi pop rock band formed by Bappa Mazumder and Sanjeeb Choudhury in November 1996 in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Formation 
Bappa Mazumder and Sanjeeb Chowdhury first met each other at a local market in Dhaka in 1993. Bappa and Sanjeeb began to work together when Bappa asked Shanjib to work on his solo album. Sanjeeb wrote a number of songs including “Rani Ghumay”, “Chokkhu Khule Dekho” and “Hattimatimtim” for Bappa's inaugural solo album. They worked together in the Aashok Karmokar photo exhibition  'Kalratri' , which impressed the audiences and encouraged the duo to form a band. Sanjeeb proposed Bappa to form a musical group. Bappa agreed and Sanjeeb named the Band Dalchhut. As a result, Dalchhut was formed in November 1996.
The initial line up only included Bappa and Sanjeeb.

In 2016, Bappa Mazumder has announced that Dalchhut have taken a brand new reformation with Shahan Kabondho as the band manager, Masum on lead guitar, Sohel on keyboards, Sharton on bass guitar and Dano on drums.

History 
In 1997, Dalchhut released their first album, titled Ah. The album failed to catch the eyes of the audience, but the band began to gain public interest and fame when a music video of the song 'Rangila' was shown on television. In regards to the first album, Sanjeeb said that "The weird thing is our first album became a hit after eight months".

In 2000, Dalchhut's second album, Hridoypur was released, did not take long to become a hit. With this album release, the band saw their popularity grow.

In 2002, Dalchhut released a third album titled Aakaashchuri, which also enjoyed popular ratings. It had 11 songs in its first edition. In 2003 it was released again with the song, "Bioscope".

 Dalchhut started shining with a new look with Rumi Rahman (drummer Rumi) on drums and Ratul on bass along with the album Akashchuri, which made a real difference in the sound.

After third album in 2002, Bappa became more busy as his popularity was increasing and at the same time Sanjeeb Chowdhury had been busy with journalism. They started working for Dalchhut's 4th album Jochhnabihar released in 2007, and it was an instant hit.

After the untimely death of Sanjeeb Chowdhury at 2007, Dalchhut released a single tracked album named "Tukro Kotha". The song was made out of one of Sanjeeb Chowdhury's poems.

Kingbodonti, a musical tribute to Sanjeeb Choudhury, by Dalchhut and Souls was released on 25 December. It features the last song recorded by Choudhury.

Dalchhut's latest album, the 6th one of the band, is Aay Amontron, released on 25 December 2010, the 47th birthday of Sanjeeb Chowdhury. With a ceremony named 'Sanjeeb Utshob' the band, with some other fellow musicians, celebrated the birthday of their loving "Sanjeeb'da" and released the new contribution. This new album contains 11 tracks, one of which, the 11th track, 'Notojanu' was written by Sanjeeb Chowdhury himself. In this album they also covered the popular patriotic song "Teerhara Ei Dheuer Shagor" by famous singer and lyricist Apel Mahmud. The album was another hit.

In 2022, Dalchhut got to go on their very first International Tour to Australia where they toured and performed in Canberra, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane & Sydney.

Judith Ann Jamison (pronounced JAM-ih-son) (born May 10, 1943) is an American dancer and choreographer. She is the artistic director emerita of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

Early training
Judith Jamison was born in 1943 to Tessie Brown Jamison and John Jamison Sr. and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with her parents and older brother. Her father taught her to play the piano, and violin. She was exposed to the prominent art culture in Philadelphia from a very early age. At the age of six, she began her dance training at Judimar School of Dance. There she studied with Marion Cuyjet who became one of Jamison's early mentors. Under Cuyjet's tutelage, Jamison studied classical ballet, and modern dance. The Judimar studios were treated as a "holy place" and there was always a sense of performance and theatricality in Cuyjet's classes. By the age of eight, Jamison began dancing on pointe and started taking classes in tap, acrobatics, and Dunham technique (which was referred to as "primitive").

A few years later, Cuyjet began sending Jamison to other teachers to advance her dance education. She learned the Cechetti method from Antony Tudor, founder of the Philadelphia Ballet Guild, and studied with Delores Brown Abelson, a graduate of Judimar who pursued a performance career in New York City before returning to Philadelphia to teach. Throughout high school, Jamison was also member of numerous sports organizations, the Glee Club, and the Philadelphia String Ensemble. She studied Dalcroze Eurhythmics, a system that teaches rhythm through movement.

At the age of 17, Jamison graduated from Judimar and began her collegiate studies at Fisk University. After three semesters there, she transferred to the Philadelphia Dance Academy (now the University of the Arts) where she studied dance with James Jamieson, Nadia Chilkovsky, and Yuri Gottschalk. In addition to her technique classes, she took courses in Labanotation, kinesiology, and other dance studies. During this time, she also learned the Horton technique from Joan Kerr, which required great strength, balance, and concentration.

In 1992, Jamison was inducted into Delta Sigma Theta sorority as an honorary member.

Performance career
In 1964, after seeing Jamison in a master class, Agnes de Mille invited her to come to New York to perform in a new work that she was choreographing for American Ballet Theatre, The Four Marys. Jamison immediately accepted the offer and spent the next few months working with the company. When the performances ended and she found herself in New York without a job, Jamison attended an audition held by Donald McKayle. She felt that she performed very poorly in the audition and claimed, "I felt as if I had two left feet." However, a few days later, a friend of McKayle's, Alvin Ailey, called Jamison to offer her a place in his company – Alvin Ailey Dance Theater.

Jamison made her premiere with Alvin Ailey Dance Theater at Chicago's Harper Theater Dance Festival in 1965 in Congo Tango Palace, and in 1966, she toured Europe and Africa with the company. Jamison had always had a strong interest in African identity; therefore, traveling to Africa with the company and having the opportunity to observe the culture first-hand was an exciting and valuable experience for her. Unfortunately, soon afterward, financial complications forced Ailey to put his company on a temporary hiatus. During this time, Jamison danced with Harkness Ballet and served as an assistant to the artistic director. However, she immediately returned to Alvin Ailey Dance Theater when the company re-formed in 1967. Jamison spent the next thirteen years dancing with Alvin Ailey Dance Theater and learned over seventy ballets. "With Ailey`s troupe, Jamison did many U.S. State Department tours of Europe, going behind the Iron Curtain as well as into Asia and Turkey. She danced quite a bit in Germany, which she says became her "second home". Throughout her performance career with the company she danced in many of Ailey's most renowned works, including Blues Suite and Revelations.

On May 4, 1971, Jamison premiered the famous solo, Cry. Alvin Ailey choreographed this sixteen-minute dance as a birthday present for his mother, Lula Cooper, and later dedicated it to "all-black women everywhere, especially our mothers." The solo is intensely physical and emotionally draining to perform. It celebrates the journey of a woman coming out of a troubled and painful world and finding the strength to overcome and conquer. Jamison never ran the full piece from start to finish until the premiere. The piece and Jamison's performance in it received standing ovations and overwhelming critical acclaim at the premiere, rewarding Jamison with great fame and recognition throughout the dance world. Today, Cry remains a crowd favorite and is still featured in the company's repertoire.

Throughout her years with Alvin Ailey Dance Theater, Jamison continued to perform all over the world. Along with her work with Ailey's company, she also appeared as a guest artist with the Cullberg Ballet, Swedish Royal Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and numerous other companies. She danced alongside many renowned dancers, including the ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov, in a duet entitled Pas de Duke, choreographed by Alvin Ailey in 1976. Finally, in 1980, she left Ailey's company to perform in the Broadway musical, Sophisticated Ladies. It was Jamison's first stage experience outside the realm of concert dance, and she admits it was initially very challenging for her. It was a completely different performance atmosphere and required a variety of new skills.

The Jamison Project
In addition to performing, Jamison wanted the opportunity to explore working with her own group of dancers. She began teaching master classes at Jacob's Pillow in 1981 and soon began choreographing her own works. She later formed The Jamison Project with a group of dancers with a strong desire to work and learn. The Project premiered on November 15, 1988, at the Joyce Theater in New York City, performing works such as Divining, Time Out, and Tease. Jamison later invited guest choreographers, including Garth Fagan, to set work for the company.

Return to Alvin Ailey Dance Theater as Artistic Associate and Artistic Director
In 1988, Jamison returned to Alvin Ailey Dance Theater as an artistic associate. Upon Ailey's death, on December 1, 1989, she assumed the role of artistic director and dedicated the next 21 years of her life to the company's success. Alvin Ailey Dance Theater continued to thrive as Jamison continued to rehearse and restage classics from the company's repertory, as well as commission distinguished choreographers to create new works for the dancers. Jamison also continued to choreograph, and created dances such as Forgotten Time, Hymn, Love Stories, and Among Us for the company. In July 2011, Jamison transitioned into the role of artistic director emerita and appointed Robert Battle to the position of artistic director designate.

Personal life
Judith Jamison was married briefly to Miguel Godreau, a dancer with the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater, from 1972 to 1974, when the marriage was annulled.

Monsters Menace America is a 2005 light-strategy board game produced by Avalon Hill, a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast. The game design is by J.C. Connors and Ben Knight.

Monsters Menace America is a redevelopment of Monsters Ravage America, a game published by Avalon Hill shortly before they were acquired by Hasbro in 1998. This new edition streamlined some rules and drastically improved the aesthetics of the game by adding plastic monsters and military units.

Like the original version, players are B-Movie monsters who rampage across America, destroying cities, mutating at radioactive sites, and stomping on military bases and famous landmarks. In addition to the monsters, each player also controls a branch of the U.S. armed forces with which they can attack other players. The game ends with a final fight called the "Monster Challenge" where all the surviving monsters fight it out to determine the king.

The six monsters included in the game are Gargantis, Konk, Megaclaw, Tomanagi, Toxicor, and Zorb. Each of these represents a famous B-Movie archetype and possesses a special ability that distinguishes it from its fellow monsters. These abilities range from Konk's expertise at smashing fighter jets to Tomanagi's prowess in sea-based combat.
In information science and information technology, single source of truth (SSOT) architecture, or single point of truth (SPOT) architecture, for information systems is the practice of structuring information models and associated data schemas such that every data element is mastered (or edited) in only one place, providing data normalization to a canonical form (for example, in database normalization or content transclusion). Any possible linkages to this data element (possibly in other areas of the relational schema or even in distant federated databases) are by reference only. Because all other locations of the data just refer back to the primary "source of truth" location, updates to the data element in the primary location propagate to the entire system, providing multiple advantages simultaneously: greater efficiency/productivity, easy prevention of mistaken inconsistencies (such as a duplicate value/copy somewhere being forgotten), and greatly simplified version control. Without SSOT architecture, rampant forking impairs clarity and productivity, imposing laborious maintenance needs. 

Deployment of an SSOT architecture is becoming increasingly important in enterprise settings where incorrectly linked duplicate or de-normalized data elements (a direct consequence of intentional or unintentional denormalization of any explicit data model) pose a risk for retrieval of outdated, and therefore incorrect, information. Common examples (i.e., example classes of implementation) are as follows: 

 In electronic health records (EHRs), it is imperative to accurately validate patient identity against a single referential repository, which serves as the SSOT. Duplicate representations of data within the enterprise would be implemented by the use of pointers rather than duplicate database tables, rows, or cells. This ensures that data updates to elements in the authoritative location are comprehensively distributed to all federated database constituencies in the larger overall enterprise architecture. EHRs are an excellent class for exemplifying how SSOT architecture is both poignantly necessary and challenging to achieve: it is challenging because inter-organization health information exchange is inherently a cybersecurity competence hurdle, and nonetheless it is necessary, to prevent medical errors, to prevent the wasted costs of inefficiency (such as duplicated work or rework), and to make the primary care and medical home concepts feasible (to achieve competent care transitions). 
 Single-source publishing as a general principle or ideal in content management relies on having SSOTs, via transclusion or (otherwise, at least) substitution. Substitution happens via libraries of objects that can be propagated as static copies which are later refreshed when necessary (that is, when refreshing of the copy-paste or import is triggered by a larger updating event, such as a new scientific advance or a piece of breaking news). Component content management systems are a class of content management systems that aim to provide competence on this level. 

Ideally, SSOT systems provide data that are authentic (and authenticatable), relevant, and referable.

Implementation

Ontologic interactions

An acknowledged prerequisite (of the notion that any given single source of truth can exist) is that it depends on the ontologic condition that no more than a single truth (about any particular fact or idea) exists, an assertion that is ontologic in both the IT sense and the general sense of that word. In many instances, this presents no problem (for example, within particular namespaces, or even across them, as long as naming collisions or broader name conflicts are adequately handled). The broadest contexts (and thus thorniest, regarding ontologic discrepancies) require adequate epistemic regime comparison and reconciliation (or at least negotiation or transactional exchanges). An archetypal example of this class of reconciliation is that two theological seminary libraries, from two different religions (X and Y), could exchange information with an SSOT architecture, but the unification of truth would reside on the level of the statement that "religion X asserts that God is purple whereas religion Y asserts that God is green", rather than on the level of "God is purple" or "God is green". This platform-agnostic concept has civil applications and foreign relations applications as well, regarding jurisdictional differences in legal definitions: for example, whether any particular economic lens is good, bad, or syncretizible (e.g., capitalism, socialism, mixed economy), legal definitions of marriage (EHR example: is patient X married or not, according to which state law or its interstate reciprocity), whether sex assignment equals legal gender (EHR example: what is the gender or gender identity of patient X, according to the patient themselves (self-report) or according to someone else), and so on.

Architectures or architectural features

An ideal implementation of SSOT is rarely possible in most enterprises. This is because many organisations have multiple information systems, each of which needs access to data relating to the same entities (e.g., customer). Often these systems are purchased as commercial off-the-shelf products from vendors and cannot be modified in trivial ways. Each of these various systems therefore needs to store its own version of common data or entities, and therefore each system must retain its own copy of a record (hence immediately violating the SSOT approach defined above). For example, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system (such as SAP or Oracle e-Business Suite) may store a customer record; the customer relationship management (CRM) system also needs a copy of the customer record (or part of it) and the warehouse dispatch system might also need a copy of some or all of the customer data (e.g., shipping address). In cases where vendors do not support such modifications, it is not always possible to replace these records with pointers to the SSOT.

For organisations (with more than one information system) wishing to implement a Single Source of Truth (without modifying all but one master system to store pointers to other systems for all entities), four supporting architectures are commonly used:

Enterprise service bus (ESB)
Master data management (MDM)
Data warehouse (DW)
Service-oriented architecture (SOA)
Event store and event sourcing (ES)

Enterprise service bus (ESB)
An enterprise service bus (ESB) allows any number of systems in an organisation to receive updates of data that has changed in another system. To implement a Single Source of Truth, a single source system of correct data for any entity must be identified. Changes to this entity (creates, updates, and deletes) are then published via the ESB; other systems which need to retain a copy of that data subscribe to this update, and update their own records accordingly. For any given entity, the master source must be identified (sometimes called the golden record). Any given system could publish (be the source of truth for) information on a particular entity (e.g., customer) and also subscribe to updates from another system for information on some other entity (e.g., product).

An alternative approach is point-to-point data updates, but these become excessively expensive to maintain as the number of systems increases, and this approach is increasingly out of favour as an IT architecture.

Master data management (MDM)
An MDM system can act as the source of truth for any given entity that might not necessarily have an alternative "source of truth" in another system. Typically the MDM acts as a hub for multiple systems, many of which could allow (be the source of truth for) updates to different aspects of information on a given entity. For example, the CRM system may be the "source of truth" for most aspects of the customer, and is updated by a call centre operator. However, a customer may (for example) also update their address via a customer service web site, with a different back-end database from the CRM system. The MDM application receives updates from multiple sources, acts as a broker to determine which updates are to be regarded as authoritative (the golden record) and then syndicates this updated data to all subscribing systems. The MDM application normally requires an ESB to syndicate its data to multiple subscribing systems.

Data warehouse (DW)
While the primary purpose of a data warehouse is to support reporting and analysis of data that has been combined from multiple sources, the fact that such data has been combined (according to business logic embedded in the data transformation and integration processes) means that the data warehouse is often used as a de facto SSOT. Generally, however, the data available from the data warehouse are not used to update other systems; rather the DW becomes the "single source of truth" for reporting to multiple stakeholders. In this context, the Data Warehouse is more correctly referred to as a "single version of the truth" since other versions of the truth exist in its operational data sources (no data originates in the DW;  it is simply a reporting mechanism for data loaded from operational systems).

Event store and event sourcing (ES)
In event oriented architectures, it has become increasingly common to find an implementation of the Event Sourcing pattern which consists of going to store the system state as an ordered sequence of state changes. To do this, you need an Event Store, a particular type of database designed to hold all the events that change the state of the system. The event store in an Event Sourcing + Command Query Responsibility Separation + Domain Driven Design + Messaging architecture is in fact a "single source of truth", with the additional advantage that it can also act as an Enterprise Service Bus as it can be put into I listen directly to the event store for status changes as everyone passes by. In addition, by saving all the events, it also plays the role of Data Warehouse. As a last advantage, it has that through this system the Shared Database pattern can be implemented, another technique not mentioned to obtain a single source of truth.

Solid and source code
In software design, the same schema, business logic and other components are often repeated in multiple different contexts, while each version refers to itself as "Source Code".  To address this problem, the concepts of SSOT can also be applied to software development principles using processes like recursive transcompiling to iteratively turn a single source of truth into many different kinds of source code, which will match each other structurally because they are all derived from the same SSOT.

Distributed SaaS data (DSD)
In cases where storing data centrally and managing it in reference locations is impractical, such as in B2B software data ecosystems where there are multiple sources of truth, companies use a DSD system. This system plays air traffic controller to provide a veneer of central data management and control by pushing updates to and enforcing data accuracy in the locations where it is stored.

Data access and field productivity
Adoption of a single source of truth execution model is on the rise in the energy sector, where the technological advancements brought about by Industry 4.0 have enabled operators to improve field productivity. With an accessible SSOT for an industrial asset, owners are able to maximize worker efficiency by providing wireless mobility that enables on-demand access to verifiable field data, engineering drawings and inventory and communications with centralized operations experts.

1988 albumsHuanghetitan (meaning "Yellow River titan"), is a genus of sauropod dinosaur from the early Cretaceous Period. It was a basal titanosauriform which lived in what is now Gansu, China.

History 
 
The type species, Huanghetitan liujiaxiaensis, was described by You et al. in 2006. It is known from fragmentary materials including two caudal vertebrae, an almost complete sacrum, rib fragments, and the left shoulder girdle, and was discovered in the eastern part of the Lanzhou Basin (Hekou Group) in the Gansu Province in 2004.

A second species, H. ruyangensis, was described in 2007 from the Aptian-Albian Haoling Formation of Ruyang County, China (Henan Province). A recent cladistic analysis has found that this species is unlikely to be closely related to H. liujiaxiaensis and requires a new genus name.

Description 
H. liujiaxiaensis is a relatively small sauropod, measuring  long and weighing . H. ruyangensis is known from a partial vertebral column and several ribs, the size of which (the largest approaches 3 m (10 ft)) indicate it had among the deepest body cavities of any known dinosaur. This second species, along with its local relatives Daxiatitan and Ruyangosaurus, is one of the biggest dinosaurs ever found in Asia, and possibly one of the largest in the world. In 2019 Gregory S. Paul suggested that the dorsal rib of Huanghetitan ruyangensis is about the same length as Patagotitan's, and its sacrum may be similar in length, possibly suggesting a similar mass range of 45–55 tonnes (49.6–60.6 short tons).

In 2007, Lü Junchang et al. created a new family for Huanghetitan, the Huangetitanidae, but this family found to be polyphyletic by Mannion et al.

The following is a cladogram from Averianov et al., 2017, based on the work of Mannion et al., showing Huanghetitan as a paraphyletic genus with "H." ruyangensis being closer to Titanosauria:
Caméra Café is a French-born concept of comedy television series exported around the world. Two movie spin-offs have been made in France under the titles of Espace détente and Le Séminaire. It was originally a French television show created by Bruno Solo, Yvan Le Bolloc'h, and Alain Kappauf and it was broadcast from September 2001 to December 2004 on the M6 channel.

700 episodes of 3 minutes each have been produced and were broadcast again on M6 in 2004. The show revolves around a dysfunctional office. Its originality stems from the fact that, within the fiction, the camera is fixed into the automated coffee machine of the office space.

The title is a French pun on "Caméra Cachée", (literally "hidden camera", or Candid Camera for the related TV show).

Plot 

The main originality of the series is the coffee machine, located in the relaxation area of the company, which becomes the point of view of the viewer during each episode. In front of it, parade the employees of the company "Geugène Electro Stim" (G.E.S.) all are caricatured to the grotesque humor, even cynical at times.

This place of choice allows the viewer to live from within the everyday atmosphere of the head office of a large company in the French (such as the presence of a driver for the president, a director of human resources and 'a full-time psychologist), with professional or private discussions that often turn into caricatures.

Some extras pass from time to time down the hall and sometimes serve as spectators in some skits at strategic moments.

The length of an episode varies on the locale. In Quebec, where the shorter format is less prevalent than in France, episodes are 30 minutes long, commercials included (inversely, the Quebec show Un gars, une fille, originally half an hour long, was reduced to 9 minutes in its French version). Italy kept the 7 minute format and Spain chose a four- to six-minute format.

Episodes
Admiral Sir Charles Bullen  (10 September 1769 – 2 July 1853) was a highly efficient and successful naval officer who served in the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and distinguished himself at the Glorious First of June, the battle of Camperdown and the battle of Trafalgar.

Early life
Charles Bullen was born in Newcastle in 1769 but spent much of his early childhood in Weymouth, Dorset. His father, John Bullen, also served in the Royal Navy and was the Surgeon General on the North American Station between 1779 and 1781. Charles' mother, Ruth (née Liddel), was a cousin of Lord Eldon who served as Lord Chancellor of Great Britain between 1801 and 1806 and again between 1807 and 1827. Richard Bullen, Charles younger brother by 10 years, became a captain in the Scots Greys, dragoons. Charles entered the navy when he was just ten years old as a volunteer (1st class) aboard the 64 gun, third rate, HMS Europe.

Career

American Revolutionary War

When his father was appointed Surgeon-General to the North American station in 1779, the 10-year-old Charles went with him aboard HMS Europe, which arrived in New York City on 25 August. On 23 December, Charles transferred to HM Sloop Loyalist and assisted in the capture of Charleston, South Carolina on 12 May 1780. He spent a short period aboard HMS Renown, which was dismasted in a gale while escorting a convoy to Quebec, before returning to Loyalist where he was promoted to Able Seaman and then Midshipman. Bullen returned to England in July 1781 aboard HM Sloop Halifax along with his father and Rear Admiral Arbuthnot, who had had some differences of opinion with Admiral Rodney.

Peace
Charles stayed ashore until 1786 and finished his schooling. At the age of 17, he joined HMS Culloden a 74-gun, third rate stationed in the Channel, in which he spent the next two years under Captain Sir Thomas Rich. In October 1789, he joined Rear Admiral Peyton aboard his flagship HMS Leander and began a spell of service in the Mediterranean that lasted two and a half years. Bullen was promoted to acting lieutenant on 9 January 1791 and the following month transferred to the frigate . His promotion was confirmed when he joined the 24-gun, post ship,  on 9 August. By the end of the year however, Bullen was back in England on half pay, during which time he married his cousin, a Miss Wood of Martock.

French Revolutionary War

When war broke out, Bullen returned to HMS Culloden, which was still under the command of Thomas Rich and sailed for the West Indies where they took part in the unsuccessful invasion of Martinique. Returning home in March 1794, Bullen transferred to HMS Ramillies in which he took part in the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 and the battle of the Glorious First of June. The captain, Henry Harvey, was subsequently promoted and replaced by Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton, who took the ship to the West Indies. Bullen continued to serve in Ramillies in the waters around the West Indies and Newfoundland until the end of 1795 when she returned to English waters, joining the North Sea Fleet under Admiral Duncan. Towards the end of 1796, Bullen re-joined Admiral Peyton in his then flagship, the 64-gun, third rate, Overyssel. This appointment didn't last long however and by Christmas, Bullen was again on half pay.

Mutiny

At the beginning of 1797, Bullen was appointed first lieutenant to HMS Monmouth and it was here he first met his new commanding officer, William Carnegie, 7th Earl of Northesk and the two became fast friends. During the Nore mutiny when rebellion broke out on the Monmouth, Bullen drew a line across the deck and threatened to shoot dead the first man to cross it. His prompt action probably saved his life and the lives of his fellow officers, including the Earl of Northesk, who was later chosen to take the rebels demands to the government. Carnegie, who had some sympathy with the rebels, resigned following suppression of the mutiny but Bullen remained on board under the new captain, James Walker and together they fought at the battle of Camperdown later that year, the crew of the Monmouth fighting hard to absolve themselves of their part in mutiny.

Camperdown

The battle of Camperdown took place on 11 October 1797. As the Monmouth was bearing down on the Dutch fleet, Captain Walker spoke to the crew, "My lads, you see your enemy; I'll lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters in the blood of your foes. Now go to your quarters and do your duty". Monmouth battled with two 50 gun Dutch ships, Alkmaar and Delft, capturing both in a brutal encounter. Bullen was placed in charge of the Delft, which he found to have been greatly damaged during the battle and leaking badly. 43 members of her crew had been killed, including the captain, and 76 injured. To add to Bullen's woes, on 14 November, a storm blew up. Unable to plug the leaks or pump the ship out, and with ten-foot of water in the hold, the decision was taken to abandon her. However, when the Delft's commanding officer, Lieutenant Heilburg, was invited into one of the longboats, he refused. Indicating the wounded, he asked, "How can I leave these unfortunate men?". Bullen agreed to stay behind and help evacuate the wounded but few could be got off. When the Delft suddenly sank, Heilburg went down with her but Bullen jumped into the sea, where he was later rescued. He was praised for marshalling the evacuation of the ship and controlling the survivors in the water until they could be rescued by the boats of HMS Veteran, HMS Russell and other neighbouring vessels. Bullen was promoted to commander for his actions and returned to his Dorset home on half pay, where he spent the next three and a half years with his wife and family.

Return to sea
In June 1801, Bullen was despatched in the sloop HMS Wasp to Sierra Leone, where a powerful allegiance of native tribal leaders were threatening British trade interests. He was rewarded with a promotion to post captain and returned to England in August 1802. When hostilities with France were renewed the following year, Bullen was given temporary command of HMS Minerve. The previous captain, Jahleel Brenton was injured when a block fell on his head, and Bullen, who was conveniently close by in Weymouth, commanded the vessel between 8 May and 3 June in 1803. Patrolling the waters off Cherbourg, Bullen captured 23 merchantmen and the frigate sent to protect them. Between 14 July 1803 and 15 May 1804, Bullen commanded the Plymouth division of Sea Fencibles, protecting the south-west of England from an invasion which, fortunately, never came. In November 1803, he was additionally given command of a flotilla which was being fitted out in the Thames for the defence of tidal estuaries and creeks. When Northesk was given the first rate flagship HMS Britannia in 1804 he asked for Bullen as his flag captain especially. Initially serving with the Channel Fleet off Brest under William Cornwallis; Britannia was sent to join a squadron under Vice Admiral Robert Calder which, in August 1805, was sent to join Nelson off Cadiz.

Battle of Trafalgar

On 30 August, the Britannia joined the blockade of the Franco-Spanish fleet and so was present on 21 October for the battle of Trafalgar. On the day of the battle, Britannia, Prince and Dreadnought, being the slowest ships present, were ordered to "...take station as convenient". At this point Bullen and Northesk had a serious disagreement about the meaning of the order, with Bullen refusing to shorten sail. Britannia fell in 5th behind  and, with no particular role allocated, attacked three ships, including the Bucentaure and the 130-gun Santissima Trinidad, before turning to pursue the enemy's flying van. After the battle, Britannia was still relatively undamaged, despite having suffered 52 casualties, and so she was able to aid other more seriously damaged ships in the storm which followed. Bullen brought three ships back to England and received prize money in excess of £3000, along with the usual awards from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund of the gold medal and sword given to Trafalgar captains. His ship was paid off on 20 June, and Bullen spent the next 15 months on half pay.

Mediterranean service
Bullen was appointed to 38 gun frigate, HMS Volontaire on 7 September 1807 and spent the next three years helping to maintain the blockade of Toulon and in operations along the French and Spanish coasts including the conveyance of the Duc D'Orleans and his brother the Comte de Beaujolais to Malta. When Spain declared war on France in May 1808, Bullen was ordered to undertake an overland expedition from Fez to Tangiers to purchase arms for the Spanish rebels. In 1809 he undertook a series of raids along the French coast, capturing the island of Pomegues and destroying Fort Rioux near Cape Croisette. The latter action also led to the capture of five vessels sheltering under the 14 gun battery. Bullen also assisted in a boat action off Rosas, which resulted in the taking of seven merchantmen and their three armed escorts. On 13 December 1810, an amphibious assault on Palamós was forced to retreat and Captain Francis William Fane, was captured. Consequently, on 1 January 1811, Bullen took command of Fane's ship, HMS Cambrian. Bullen continued to support the Spanish in operations along the Catalan coast, destroying the shore batteries at Palamos and St Phillion in April that year. Returning to the bay of Rosas, Bullen captured 19 merchant vessels off Cadaques before sailing south to Tarragona in April, where, together with other ships from the squadron he aided the early defence during the siege, at one point risking running his ship aground by taking it close in shore to deliver broadsides on the enemy. Later, whilst serving in a battery ashore in Selva, he was badly wounded. Bullen quit Cambrian on 9 December and returned to England invalided.

Later service

Bullen did not go to sea again until 10 November 1814 when he was appointed to HMS Akbar as flag captain to Admiral Thomas Byam Martin, helping to supervise the partition of naval supplies at Antwerp. Bullen and the Akbar then proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia with Rear Admiral Edward Griffith. In June 1815, Bullen was made a companion of the Order of the Bath for his services. The Akbar was paid off on 1 January 1817.

After nearly seven years ashore, Bullen returned to active duty on 12 December 1823, when he was appointed commodore on the west coast of Africa. With his broad pennant in the fifth rate , he supported operations along the Gold Coast during the First Ashanti War. While defending the British depot at Cape Coast, his men were forced to strip the lead from the roof to cast extra bullets. In anti slave trade operations, Bullen was responsible for freeing almost 10,000 would be slaves before his return home in September 1827.

In July 1830, he was appointed a Commissioner of Navy for the Navy Board for Chatham Dockyard and then Pembroke Dockyard before being given command of the Royal Yacht Royal Sovereign. In 1835, Bullen became a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order, and was dubbed a Knight Bachelor. He gained promotion to rear admiral in January 1837 and although he retired in March the same year, he continued to receive awards and promotions. Bullen was awarded the Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1839, a good service pension of £300 a year in 1843 and was promoted to vice admiral in 1846. In 1852 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath followed by promotion to full admiral in July that year.  Admiral Charles Bullen died aged 84 on 2 July 1853, the last surviving captain of the British fleet at Trafalgar.
CS Minaur Baia Mare, commonly known as CS Minaur or simply Minaur, is handball team based in Baia Mare, Maramureș, Romania.

History

HC Minaur Baia Mare was founded on May 15, 1974. Thus, it became the first sports club in the country specializing exclusively in handball. Its name means Gold Mine, referring to the gold mines around Baia Mare. From the very beginning, Minaur has been playing exclusively in the first division of the Romanian handball championship. In the beginning, they played in golden jerseys. The first entry to the Romanian Handball Cup was won by Minaur in 1977/1978. In 1978/79, they reached the semi-finals of the EHF Cup Winners' Cup undefeated, with two victories, where they were dismissed by SC Magdeburg. He will be second in the 1979/80 and 1980/81 seasons. In 1980/81, EHF Cup Winners' Cup reached the semi-finals again, where it was eliminated against TuS Nettelstedt. In these years, Minaur is the only rural team from the Romanian league that plays on the international stage, often much more successfully than the Bucharest clubs. In 1985, he achieved the first Romanian international handball success when he defeated the Soviet ZTR Zaporizhzhia in the final of the EHF Cup. Then, in 1988, he repeated the success. 24 years after the foundation, in 1998, the dream of every Baia Mare handball lover came true: HC Minaur became the champion of Romania! A year later, in 1999, the success was repeated, the team became champions again. The team was last champion in 2015. In 1979, 1981 and 1986, Minaur reached the semi-finals of the EHF Cup Winners' Cup.

The FIA GT3 European Championship was a sports car racing series organized by the Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) and regulated by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).  It was a championship derived from the international FIA GT1 World Championship, but meant to provide competition for more amateur racers in closer to production cars. The series used extensive performance balancing and handicap weights to make cars more equal.

FIA GT3 European Championship races served as support races for the FIA GT1 World Championship races that took place in Europe.

History
The FIA GT3 European Championship was launched in 2006 as a way to expand manufacturer involvement in motorsports as well as to help amateur drivers across Europe.  It attempts to combine multiple one-make series into a larger event with a race within a race, teams competing not only to beat others in their own manufacturer cup but also to win the overall race.

In the future, the FIA and SRO plan to not only expand the overall European championship, but also to help in the development of multiple one-make series across Europe, similar to the Ferrari Challenge and Porsche Supercup.

Vehicles
Following in the established name usage from FIA GT, the FIA's Group GT3 differs from its GT1 and GT2 counterparts by using more low-cost engineering and design elements in the development of the road cars to their racing counterparts, as well as attempting to make all cars equal by pre- and in-season performance balancing adjustments.  Unlike FIA GT1's GT1, the GT3 class cars are not allowed to be developed by their manufacturers over the course of a racing season.  Manufacturers simply provide a ready-to-race car to a customer and the teams are limited in what they can alter from production specs.  All cars that participate in GT3 must be allowed permission and equalized with the competition by the FIA.

The Jaguar XKR, Ford Mustang FR500GT, Ford GT, and Morgan Aero 8 were added to the homologation list for 2007, while the Venturi Atlantique silhouette, Maserati Trofeo, and Lotus Exige were all dropped due to lack of participation. The Jaguar XKR, Ford Mustang, and Morgan were eventually dropped by the 2011 season.  The Audi R8 LMS and the Alpina B6 were homologated for 2009, while the Ferrari F430 GT3 was replaced by the 430 GT3 Scuderia. The Alpina B6 and Chevrolet Corvette Z06R were also dropped by the 2011 season, while the Ferrari 430 GT3 Scuderia was replaced with the 458 Italia GT3. 

From 2006-09 teams were limited to a maximum of 3 cars, with each car having 2 drivers.  From 2010 teams are limited to  a maximum of two cars, each with two drivers.  A team must use the same type of car for each of their entries.  There can be no more than six entries per marque (three two car teams), although teams entering cars in the GT1 championship can enter cars in GT3 beyond this restriction.

Drivers
The drivers in FIA GT3 are not on the same level as those in FIA GT, in that they are intended to be more amateur drivers than the professionals who are hired in FIA GT.  The term gentleman driver is that most commonly used to describe the drivers in FIA GT3. However, in order to ensure that the drivers in FIA GT3 are of amateur status, the FIA put into place rules regarding what determines a driver's skill level.  

Drivers under the age of 55 who fit the following criteria are not allowed in FIA GT3:
 Has held an FIA Super Licence or Grade A License.
 Has finished in the Top 10 in Formula 3000, A1 Grand Prix, GP2, Indy Racing League, or Champ Car World Series. (Though Formula 3000, A1 Grand Prix, and Champ Car are all defunct currently, the regulations for those are still in effect because drivers who participated in those series may still be active in other disciplines.)
 Has finished in the Top 6 of any international or national Formula 3 championship.
 Has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans outright.
 Has been a hired works driver for a major automobile manufacturer.
 Has achievements or performances which, according to the SRO and FIA, deem that individual a professional racing driver.

Exception to this is that drivers over the age of 45 can petition the SRO and FIA to be allowed to race even with prior professional experience.

Races
For each event in the FIA GT3 season, two individual races are held.  Each driver on the two car team qualifies the car individually, and then starts each of the two races from their respective starting position, with one driver starting the first race and the other driver starting the second race.  Each race requires one pit stop, where the team must switch between the two drivers, as well as change all four tires.  Each team is limited to only two crew members in the pits during a pit stop. All races are one hour in length.

Championships
FIA GT3 attempts to present itself as a gathering of cup races.  Besides the fact that all cars are individually fighting against others to have a race win, cars are also meant to be competing against cars of their same make. Each individual make in GT3 has their own respective drivers championship alongside the overall GT3 Teams Championship and Drivers Championship.

Points are awarded to the top eight on the scale of 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1, with each car in a team scoring points even if multiple entries finish in scoring positions.

Champions

Similar series
On November 29, 2006, the German ADAC launched a race series known as GT Masters, which will be a national level series for FIA GT3 cars. Their initial season in 2007 will feature six races (all but one in Germany), serving as support races for the 24 Hours Nürburgring and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.   The series is the first national level version of FIA GT3.

In 2005 the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport launched the return of the Australian GT Championship which uses older GT2 and GT3 cars with balanced performance.  the Australian GT Championship allows GT3 cars and will allow older GT cars as well.

Starting from 2007, the GT3 Brasil Championship has been held in Brazil, also organized by SRO, with several veteran drivers racing in some events, such as former Formula One champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet and former Brazilian Stock Car champions Chico Serra and Alexandre Negrão, who also was the first series champion. Differently from the European series, GT3 Brasil accepts professional drivers, in a system where drivers are graded from A (International Driver) to D (Fully Amateur), however, at least one of the drivers in each car must be of amateur status (C or D), except if a team is composed of two B-graded drivers, in that case, the car gets a 60 kg ballast penalty.

Various other championships are also running now which allow GT3-spec cars to participate, notably British GT Championship, FFSA GT Championship, Belcar, Super GT and Super Taikyu.

In 2007 the SRO and FIA have launched a similar championship, known as the GT4 European Cup, which features the same concept of using serial production sports cars, but with smaller engine sizes, minimum modifications and restrictions on the professionalism of participating drivers.

In 2010-12, the FIA GT1 World Championship acted as a senior series to this series. Drivers in GT1 drive were more experienced (and can be hired by the factory), drove more powerful cars, and the season was longer and visited more countries (including non-European countries). Because the GT1 Championship allowed performance balanced GT3 cars and 2009-spec GT2 cars in 2012, the only difference in the car lineups was the GT3 Championship still being restricted to GT3 cars. All GT3 races occurred on the same weekend as a corresponding GT1 race, and the races were also at different times of the day (e.g. Paul Ricard hosts both a GT1 and a GT3 race on the same weekend). Some manufacturers like Aston Martin had raced cars in both the GT1 and GT3 championships.

Greenway Court is a historic country estate near White Post in rural Clarke County, Virginia.  The property is the site of the seat of the vast 18th-century land empire of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693-1781), the only ennobled British colonial proprietor to live in one of the North American colonies.  The surviving remnants of his complex — a later replacement brick house and Fairfax's stone land office — were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

Description
Greenway Court is located down a long private drive on the west side of White Post Road south of the village of White Post.  The property now consists of about , although it was in the 18th century at the center of landholdings in excess of .  Its principal feature today is a brick farmhouse built in 1828, the original plantation house having been demolished c. 1834.  The main historic structure surviving from the period of the Fairfax residency is the Land Office, a c. 1762 single-story gable-roofed limestone structure, and there is also a timber smokehouse dating to the 18th century.

History

Greenway Court was the center of the "Northern Neck Proprietary" or "Fairfax Grant", which passed to Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron from his mother's family, the Culpepers, who had taken proprietorship of the land in 1673.  Fairfax laid out the Greenway Court estate in 1747, intending it to be a much larger establishment than it became.  The main house was a -story timber structure with long sloping roofs and corbelled brick chimneys.  It was originally intended to house the land steward, but it was occupied by Fairfax with his nephew, Thomas Bryan Martin, until his death in 1781.  Fairfax employed a young George Washington as a surveyor on his extensive land holdings.

Abandoned, the roof of the main house at Greenway Court collapsed in 1834, after which the structure was pulled down.

A visit to this estate is the subject of "A Night at Greenway Court," an 1896 short story by Willa Cather.

Unincorporated community
Greenway Court is used as a name to describe the unincorporated community in which the former estate is located.
Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is a 456-residue (~50kDa) protein that is part of the innate immune system, coded for in the human by the BPI gene. It belongs to the family of lipid-binding serum glycoproteins.

Distribution and function
BPI was initially identified in neutrophils, but is found in other tissues including the epithelial lining of mucous membranes.
It is an endogenous antibiotic protein with potent killing activity against Gram-negative bacteria.  It binds to compounds called lipopolysaccharides produced by Gram-negative bacteria.  Lipolysaccharides are potent activators of the immune system; however, BPI at certain concentrations can prevent this activation.

BPI was discovered by Jerrold Weiss and Peter Elsbach at New York University Medical School.

rBPI21
Because lipopolysaccharides are potent inflammatory agents, and the action of antibiotics can result in the release of these compounds, the binding capacity of BPI was explored as a possible means of reducing injury.  Xoma Ltd. developed a recombinant 21kDa portion of the BPI molecule called rBPI21, NEUPREX, or opebecan.  In a trial, it was found to decrease the mortality of Gram-negative bacterial-induced sepsis.  Studies suggest that its binding activity is not the means by which it mediates its protective effect.  Studies show biological effects with Gram-positive bacteria and even in infection by the protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii.

The N-terminal portion of murine BPI (199 amino acids) genetically fused to Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 GvpC protein was bound to the surface of gas vesicle nanoparticles (GVNPs) and tested for protective activity using a murine model of endotoxic shock. Depending on the time of delivery and exposure to lethal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine, the treatment resulted in increased survival and reduced symptoms of inflammation, including inflammatory anemia, recruitment of neutrophils, liver apoptosis as well as increased pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels. When administered via footpad and before LPS exposure, there was 100% survival of the experimental cohort.

State Route 155 (SR 155) is a  state highway in the central part of the U.S. state of Alabama. The southern terminus of the highway is at an intersection with U.S. Route 31 (US 31) just north of Jemison. The northern terminus of the highway is at an intersection with SR 119 in Montevallo.

Route description
From its beginning at Jemison, SR 155 travels in a northwestward direction as it leaves Chilton County. Crossing into Shelby County, the highway continues, traveling through rural areas of the county. Southeast of Montevallo, the highway has an intersection with SR 25 and turns west, forming a brief wrong-way concurrency.

SR 155 diverts from SR 25 at Montevallo and resumes its northward trajectory. The northern terminus of the highway is at an intersection with SR 119 near the entrance to the campus of the University of Montevallo.

Major intersections
In American football, Air Coryell is the offensive scheme and philosophy developed by former San Diego Chargers coach Don Coryell. The offensive philosophy has been also called the "Coryell offense" or the "vertical offense".

With Dan Fouts as quarterback, the San Diego Chargers' offense was among the greatest passing offenses in National Football League history. The Chargers led the league in passing yards an NFL record six consecutive years from 1978 to 1983 and again in 1985. They also led the league in total yards in offense from 1978 to 1983 and in 1985. Dan Fouts, Charlie Joiner, Kellen Winslow, and Don Coryell would all be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame from those Charger teams.

Pre-Coryell NFL
Before Coryell, NFL teams generally used the pro set formation in ball-control, grind-it-out-style offenses that used play-action fakes to set up deep passing attempts when defenses stacked up vs the running game. The pro set features a tight end, two wide receivers, a halfback, and a fullback, often split behind the quarterback. On pass plays, the pro set provided one or even two backs to help protect the quarterback. QBs generally took snaps from under center to allow for more effective use of the play action pass. 

In 1978, the contact from defenders on receivers was minimized with the passing of the Mel Blount Rule, which prohibited defenders from making contact with receivers past five yards from the line of scrimmage.

Coryell opens up passing in the NFL
After Coryell arrived in the NFL from jobs with college football teams, he set the league on its ear with his passing offenses. He won two consecutive division titles (1974–1975) with the St. Louis Cardinals, whose offense emphasized the pass while running the standard pro set. Coryell moved to the Chargers and reached the playoffs in four consecutive seasons that included three straight division titles (1979–1982). The Chargers in 1979 were the first AFC Western Division champion to run more passing plays (541) than rushing (481). Coryell's Chargers teams led the league in passing in seven of eight years. The Pro Football Hall of Fame called the Chargers' offenses under Coryell "one of the most explosive and exciting offenses that ever set foot on an NFL field." Coryell was the first coach to win more than 100 games at both the collegiate and professional level. Coryell's offensive innovations changed the entire nature of the league from a run-first league to a pass-first one.

As of 2022, most NFL offenses' passing games are based at least partially on Coryell conventions.

Mike Martz, who ran The Greatest Show on Turf with the St. Louis Rams, said, "Don is the father of the modern passing game. People talk about the West Coast offense, but Don started the 'West Coast' decades ago and kept updating it. You look around the NFL now, and so many teams are running a version of the Coryell offense. Coaches have added their own touches, but it's still Coryell's offense. He has disciples all over the league. He changed the game".

Attributes of Air Coryell
The Coryell offense is based on Sid Gillman's offense that required the defense to defend the entire field. The passing game was based on timing and rhythm, and coaching the system required a lot of repetition. Coryell expanded on those principles by putting receivers in motion. With the new defensive rules limiting contact to near the line of scrimmage, receivers in motion would be virtually impossible to jam. Coryell not only placed wide receivers in motion, he did so with tight ends and running backs as well. Putting the players in motion also had the advantage of allowing the quarterback to determine pre-snap if the defense would be playing zone or man-to-man defense. It was easier to read the coverage before the snap than afterwards due to the pass rush. It is also harder for a defender to cover if he has to change direction with the receiver instead of squaring up and getting set before a play. Defenses that react to the motion could get confused, leaving a defender in the wrong position.

The offense did not have any set formations, as receivers could line up anywhere on any given pass play. Passes were thrown to a spot before the receiver even got there, allowing defenders no hint where the pass was being targeted. Each receiver had two or three different route options they could adjust depending on the coverage during the play. Throwing a deep pass was the first option on each play. Coryell's offense had more progressions than Gillman's, with backup options for screen passes and underneath routes.

The Coryell offense is a combination of deep and mid range passing and power running. The offense relies on getting all five receivers out into patterns that combined stretched the field, setting up defensive backs with route technique, and the quarterback throwing to a spot on time where the receiver can catch and turn upfield. Pass protection is critical to success because at least two of the five receivers will run a deep in, skinny post, comeback, speed out, or shallow cross.

Overall, the goal of the Coryell offense is to have at least two downfield, fast wide receivers who adjust to the deep pass very well, combined with a sturdy pocket quarterback with a strong arm. The Coryell offense uses three key weapons. The first is a strong inside running game, the second is its ability to strike deep with two or more receivers on any play, and the third is to not only use those two attacks in cooperation with each other, but to include a great deal of mid-range passing to a TE, WR, or back.

The Coryell offense introduced the concept of a tight end that ran wide receiver-type routes with Kellen Winslow in 1980. Tight ends previously were primarily blockers lined up next to an offensive lineman and ran short to medium drag routes. Winslow was put in motion so he would not be jammed at the line, or he was lined up wide or in the slot against a smaller cornerback. Former Chargers assistant coach Al Saunders said Winslow was "a wide receiver in an offensive lineman's body." Back then, defenses would cover Winslow with a strong safety or a linebacker, as zone defenses were not as popular. Strong safeties in those times were almost like another linebacker, a run defender who could not cover a tight end as fast as Winslow. Providing another defender to help the strong safety opened up other holes. Head coach Jon Gruden called Winslow the first "joker" in the NFL. He could line up unpredictably in any formation from a three-point stance as a blocker to a two-point stance or being in motion as a receiver.

After the Chargers in 1980 acquired running back Chuck Muncie, the offense started using a single set back featuring Muncie as the lone running back and adding a second tight end into the game. When defenses countered with extra defensive backs, the offense would run the ball. Joe Gibbs, the Chargers offensive coordinator at the time, said that marked "the evolution of the one-back offense."

Gibbs served as head coach of the Washington Redskins from 1981-1992, and during that time, he won three Super Bowls with a Coryell offense.  His offense featured a smash mouth running game with 3 different running backs, Hall of Famer John Riggins, George Rogers and Earnest Byner, behind a massive offensive line known as the "Hogs." Gibbs's offense also showcased a 3-receiver deep air attack featuring Hall of Famer Art Monk, Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders, known as "The Posse." Gibbs usually kept the tight end in as an extra blocker, especially to neutralize pass rushing specialist and Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants. Today, many Coryell offenses still reduce the use a tight end, except in the red zone,. 

Gibbs, who earned induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his work as Redskins head coach, is also the first head coach in NFL history to win 3 Super Bowls with 3 different quarterbacks: Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, and Mark Rypien. Gibbs also coached the Redskins from 2004-2007, but was unable to duplicate the success he enjoyed during his first term in Washington. 

Norv Turner, a former Washington Redskins and San Diego Chargers head coach, and offensive coordinator for many NFL teams (most notably for the Dallas Cowboys during the early 1990s), also implemented a version of the Coryell style of offense. The Turner strain of Coryell offenses are still very reliant on a good receiving TE. Norv Turner strains sometimes feature an 'F-Back' (formerly known as an 'H-Back' in the 1980s), a hybrid tight end/wide receiver/fullback/running back. An F-Back is a multi-purpose, unpredictable tool for the offense. On any play he may carry the ball, lead block or pass block, play as a wide receiver, or run a tight end route. He is also part decoy, as his unpredictable role forces defenses to keep an eye on him, thereby opening up other opportunities for the offense..

History of the name
Originally it was known as the West Coast offense until an article about San Francisco 49ers Head Coach Bill Walsh in Sports Illustrated in the early 80s incorrectly called Walsh's offense "the West Coast offense," and this mis-labelling stuck. Subsequently, Coryell's offense scheme was referred to as "Air Coryell"—the name announcers had assigned to his high powered Charger offenses in San Diego, featuring 3 Hall of Famers in QB Dan Fouts, WR Charlie Joiner, & TE Kellen Winslow, as well as Pro Bowl WR Wes Chandler & HB Chuck Muncie. Today it is also known as the "Coryell offense", although the "vertical offense" is another accepted name.

Disciples of Air Coryell

In NFL coaching circles, the most famous and successful advocates of the Air Coryell system are Norv Turner, Mike Martz and Al Saunders.

Norv Turner's version

Norv Turner first learned the offense from longtime Coryell assistant Ernie Zampese. As offensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys, Turner ran Coryell's offense with a greater emphasis on sideline throws than the Chargers used. Turner's take on the Coryell system turned around the career of Hall of Fame QB Troy Aikman, and has also proven to be very successful with talented high draft picks struggling with the complexities of the NFL, such as Alex Smith. Turner's variant is not the most robust flavor of the Air Coryell offense.  It is a very sound, QB friendly scheme that favors taking controlled chances, like quicker midrange post passes to WRs off play action rather than slower developing passes that leave QBs exposed.  It is almost exclusively run out of the pro set. Turner favors a more limited palette of plays than Coryell and most other Coryell disciples, instead insisting on precise execution.  His offenses are usually towards the top of the league standings, but are often labeled predictable.  His offenses tend to include a strong offensive line, a strong running game, a #1 WR who can stretch the field and catch jump balls in the end-zone, a good receiving TE to attack the space the WRs create in the middle of the field and a FB who fills the role of a lead blocker and a final option as an outlet receiver. In Dallas, Turner helped make RB Emmitt Smith & WR Michael Irvin Hall of Famers, and TE Jay Novacek a five time Pro Bowler. 

As offensive coordinator of the Cowboys under head coach Jimmy Johnson, Norv Turner enjoyed great success, piloting Dallas to back-to-back Super Bowl titles in 1992 and 1993. His record as a head coach, however, has only seen limited results. Turner first served as head coach of the Washington Redskins from 1994-2000, but the team only made the playoffs once, in 1999. He also served as head coach of the Oakland Raiders from 2004-2005, but endured 2 more losing seasons. Turner did, however, enjoy a good amount of success as San Diego Chargers head coach from 2007-2012. During his time with the Chargers, Turner's system helped quarterback Philip Rivers set new franchise records for single-season quarterback rating and touchdown passes in 2008. Besides Rivers, the Chargers featured a strong running game, starring Hall of Fame RB LaDainian Tomlinson. Turner's offense also had a potent passing game, which featured multiple-time Pro Bowl TE Antonio Gates. San Diego won 3 straight AFC West division titles, from 2007-2009. However, despite having one of the NFL's most talented rosters, Turner was never able to guide the Chargers to the Super Bowl. Norv Turner also owns the rather dubious distinction of having the most career wins of any NFL head coach with a career losing record, compiling an overall record of 118-126-1 (.484), regular season and playoff games combined.

Mike Martz's version
The Mike Martz variant was a much more aggressive passing offense, frequently deploying pre-snap motion and shifts, with the running game often forgotten. There is much less of a focus on play action. The Martz variant favored an elusive feature back who can catch the ball, such as Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk, over the power runners the Turner scheme prefers. Martz credited both his influences on his variation of the offensive system and his overall coaching philosophy to Don Coryell. Martz first learned the Air Coryell offense as an assistant coach working under his mentor, Ernie Zampese. Martz continued learning the offense in the mid-90s as the quarterbacks coach of the Washington Redskins, working under the tutelage of head coach Norv Turner.

In 1999, Martz, then serving as offensive coordinator for Hall of Fame head coach Dick Vermeil, helped pilot the St. Louis Rams to victory in Super Bowl XXXIV. The Rams' offense, which was also known as "The Greatest Show on Turf", featured Hall of Fame QB Kurt Warner, who was the NFL MVP for the 1999 season (Warner earned another NFL MVP award in 2001). RB Marshall Faulk also played a prominent role in the St. Louis offense that season. Faulk won the NFL MVP award in 2000, and he would also win 3 straight AP NFL Offensive of the Year awards from 1999-2001. Additionally, St. Louis's offensive line was strong, anchored by multiple-time Pro Bowler and fellow Hall of Famer Orlando Pace. Lastly, the Rams' receiving core was impressive, featuring 4 strong wide receivers: Hall of Fame WR Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Ricky Proehl and Az-Zahir Hakim. When Vermeil retired after Super Bowl XXXIV, Martz replaced him as head coach, starting in the 2000 season. The Rams set a new NFL record for total offensive yards that same season, with 7,335. 5,492 of those were passing yards, also a new NFL team record. From 1999-2001, St. Louis became the only team in NFL history to score 500+ points in 3 consecutive years. In all, the Rams totaled 1,569 points, more than any other NFL team in any 3-year stretch. The Rams also became the first team to gain more than 20,000 yards of total offense in a 3-year stretch. Martz coached the Rams from 2000-2005, compiling a 53-32 regular season record and a 3-4 playoff record.

Meanwhile, Vermeil came out of retirement to coach the Kansas City Chiefs from 2001-2005. Despite having decent success in Kansas City, he wasn't able to lead the Chiefs to a Super Bowl appearance. However, in 2022, Vermeil earned induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his work as an NFL head coach.

Al Saunders version

Al Saunders was the former wide receiver coach under Don Coryell in San Diego, and he succeeded him as head coach of the Chargers in the middle of the 1986 season. The Al Saunders variant is heavily influenced by Don Coryell and Al Saunders's former boss, former Coryell assistant and 2-time Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, whose Ace formation (single back, two wide receivers, a tight end, and a halfback) was very effective in the 1980s.  The Al Saunders variant is a more conservative variant than the Martz version, but also quite complex.  It is better suited for a veteran quarterback. It does not insist on size at wide receiver or halfback like the Turner variant and as such has difficulties in short yardage and red zone situations. It does not require a pair of dominant fast receivers like the Martz system, and is not as aggressive attacking down the field. Consequently, the Saunders system does not score as many points as the Martz system. Saunders's scheme is a more sound variant than Martz's scheme, offering a little more blocking and more run support for the quarterback. The Saunders variant pulls in many Coryell concepts that the Turner system eliminated in favor of simplicity. Saunders only went 17-22 in 2 1/2 years as a head coach.

West Coast offense comparisons
The Coryell offense attacked vertically through seams, while the West Coast offense moved laterally as much as vertically through angles on curl and slant routes. The Coryell offense had lower completion percentages than the West Coast offense, but the returns were greater on a successful play. "The Coryell offense required more talented players, a passer who could get the ball there, and men who can really run—a lot of them," said Walsh. He said the West Coast offense was developed out of necessity to operate with less talented players. He noted, "[Coryell] already had the talent and used it brilliantly."

Impact
Former head coach Marty Schottenheimer said "putting three receivers on one side and flooding that area" probably originated from the Coryell offense. Head coach Bill Belichick notes that the pass-catching tight ends that get paid the most money are "all direct descendants of Kellen Winslow" and there are fewer tight ends now that can block on the line. Former defensive coordinator Joe Collier credits the Coryell offense with creating an evolution by using multiple receivers, forcing defenses to counter with different packages. As a result, more defensive backs were drafted, and linebackers that could also cover inside receivers were sought. Defenses were altered to use nickel and dime defenses in response to offensive formation; their usage was no longer limited to down and distance. Former head coach Dick Vermeil said no other NFL offense "performs more efficiently or scores more points" than the Coryell offense.

The WIVB-TV Tower is a  guyed steel mast located at 8242 Center Street in Colden, New York, United States. The tower site was first used in 1948 by the Buffalo Evening News as the main broadcast tower for WIVB-TV (channel 4, the former WBEN-TV), now owned by Nexstar Media Group, who also owns the tower itself.

The tower is located in a farm field and fenced off near the entrance from Center Street. There are two towers on the site: a newer tower, and the older original 1948 structure.

WIVB temporarily left the tower site after 70 years in April 2018 when it entered into a channel-sharing agreement with sister station WNLO (channel 23) and sold its standalone digital channel allocation in the broadcast spectrum auction, transmitting for the next year from the WNED-TV (channel 17) tower in eastern Grand Island with WNLO while new tower construction took place to upgrade its television transmitter and antenna structure (WNLO transmitted from Grand Island since before the Western New York Public Broadcasting Association sold WNLO (then WNEQ) to WIVB's owners at the time, LIN Media, in 2001). It returned to the site in July 2019 after the two Nexstar stations both shifted to their new post-spectrum channel allocation, which also addressed the lack of signal range for Southern Tier viewers regarding both stations from Grand Island.

In addition to its longstanding use for WIVB, its former sister station, the Educational Media Foundation's WBKV (102.5, the former WBEN-FM and WTSS) uses the site. WBKV is noted for being included in a grandfather clause allowing the station to transmit from the tower at 110,000 watts, more than double the otherwise allowable power for a station in the northeastern United States, which allows the signal to also serve the Greater Toronto Area to the north across Lake Ontario.
Frank Bartlet Adler (better known by his stage name Felix Adler; June 17, 1895 – February 1, 1960), was an American circus performer and entertainer. Known as "The King of Clowns", he performed for Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey for 20 years. He was inducted into the International Clown Hall of Fame in 1989.

Life

Felix Adler was born in Clinton, Iowa on June 17, 1895. He became interested in performing at age 9, when a circus visited his hometown.

Adler and his wife, Amelia, ran the first American husband-and-wife independent circus, and he was the second clown to appear on television after Sombris Aremelo, an Italian clown.

Amelia Adler appeared, in costume and makeup, as a guest on April 10, 1955 episode of the American television quiz program, What's My Line?  Adler also appears as a clown in the 1952 film The Greatest Show on Earth.

In addition to his "King Of Clowns" moniker, Adler was known as "The White House Clown" for his number of command performances before United States Presidents.

His outlandish costumes often featured a huge grossly exaggerated posterior, made from two inflated beach balls held in place by a brassiere-like canvas sling.

Identified in the annals of Clowndom as a "Whiteface" clown, his exclusive "face" was easily differentiated from other clowns by a sparkling rhinestone embedded in the tip of his red putty nose.

During his career, Adler performed before millions of circus fans in the United States. 

His image was placed onto at least two classic Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus posters, and a commercial mask resembling this face was created and sold by Verne Langdon.

He died at Saint Clare's Hospital in New York on February 1, 1960, following surgery on an ulcer. He is buried in Springdale Cemetery in Clinton, Iowa.

Recognition

Felix Adler was once photographed by American designer Charles Eames for the latter's visual slide presentation accompanied by circus music, a photograph which today retains fame in the form of a cover for the compact disc Circus Clown Calliope! Vols. 1&2. 

He was inducted into the International Clown Hall of Fame in 1989.

Thomas Edward Dandelet (August 1, 1897 – March 30, 1950) was an American college football and college basketball coach. He served as the head football coach at the First District Agricultural School of Jonesboro, Arkansas—now known as Arkansas State University—from 1922 to 1923 and at Marshall College—now known as Marshall University—from 1931 to 1934, compiling a career college football record of 18–29–3. Dandelet was also the head basketball coach at Marshall from 1931 to 1935, tallying a mark of 43–35.

Career
From 1922 to 1923, Dandelet coached at the First District Agricultural School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, where he compiled an 0–13–1 record. Returning to the Tri-State (West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky) area, Dandelet played for semi-professional football teams like Armco Steel in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, and with early National Football League teams like the Ironton (Ohio) Tanks and Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans (today's Detroit Lions organization), while coaching football at his alma mater, the Wonders of Ceredo-Kenova High School in nearby Wayne County, West Virginia.

From 1931 to 1934, Dandelet coached at Marshall, where he compiled an 18–16–2 record despite being underfunded and out-manned often in the Buckeye Conference, which included the University of Cincinnati, Ohio University, the University of Dayton, Miami University and Ohio Wesleyan University. After being released as football coach to make way for Cam Henderson to assume the Herd football and basketball jobs, Dandelet remained as a professor in the Health, Physical Education and Recreation Department and was also Dean of Men through 1950 at Marshall College.

Dandelet died of a heart attack at his home in Huntington, West Virginia on March 30, 1950.

"She Thinks His Name Was John" is a song written by Sandy Knox and Steve Rosen, and recorded by American country music icon Reba McEntire.  It was released in July 1994 as the second single from her album Read My Mind.  Upon its release, the song gained media attention and controversy for its storyline, regarding a woman who was dying from AIDS.

Content
"She Thinks His Name Was John" tells the story of a woman who is dying from AIDS, which she acquired after becoming intoxicated and having a one-night stand with a man whom she did not previously know. The song recounts how, upon learning she has contracted AIDS, she struggles to remember the man with whom she had her affair; she cries herself to sleep over dreams and life's milestones she will never experience, (such as marriage and motherhood); and how former friends pity her because of the decision that led to her illness.

Sandy Knox, one of the song's writers, was inspired to write "She Thinks His Name Was John" after losing her brother to the disease. The song was released as a single after several radio stations began playing it as an album cut.

In mathematics, a quadratic form over a field F is said to be isotropic if there is a non-zero vector on which the form evaluates to zero. Otherwise the quadratic form is anisotropic. More explicitly, if q is a quadratic form on a vector space V over F, then a non-zero vector v in V is said to be isotropic if . A quadratic form is isotropic if and only if there exists a non-zero isotropic vector (or null vector) for that quadratic form. 

Suppose that  is quadratic space and W is a subspace of V. Then W is called an isotropic subspace of V if some vector in it is isotropic, a totally isotropic subspace if all vectors in it are isotropic, and an anisotropic subspace if it does not contain any (non-zero) isotropic vectors. The  of a quadratic space is the maximum of the dimensions of the totally isotropic subspaces.

A quadratic form q on a finite-dimensional real vector space V is anisotropic if and only if q is a definite form:
 either q is positive definite, i.e.  for all non-zero v in V ; 
 or q is negative definite, i.e.  for all non-zero v in V. 

More generally, if the quadratic form is non-degenerate and has the signature , then its isotropy index is the minimum of a and b. An important example of an isotropic form over the reals occurs in pseudo-Euclidean space.

Hyperbolic plane

Let F be a field of characteristic not 2 and .  If we consider the general element  of V, then the quadratic forms  and  are equivalent since there is a linear transformation on V that makes q look like r, and vice versa. Evidently,  and  are isotropic. This example is called the hyperbolic plane in the theory of quadratic forms. A common instance has F = real numbers in which case  and  are hyperbolas. In particular,  is the unit hyperbola. The notation  has been used by Milnor and Husemoller for the hyperbolic plane as the signs of the terms of the bivariate polynomial r are exhibited.

The affine hyperbolic plane was described by Emil Artin as a quadratic space with basis  satisfying , where the products represent the quadratic  form.

Through the polarization identity the quadratic form is related to a symmetric bilinear form .

Two vectors u and v are orthogonal when . In the case of the hyperbolic plane, such u and v are hyperbolic-orthogonal.

Split quadratic space
A space with quadratic form is split (or metabolic) if there is a subspace which is equal to its own orthogonal complement; equivalently, the index of isotropy is equal to half the dimension. The hyperbolic plane is an example, and over a field of characteristic not equal to 2, every split space is a direct sum of hyperbolic planes.

Relation with classification of quadratic forms 

From the point of view of classification of quadratic forms, anisotropic spaces are the basic building blocks for quadratic spaces of arbitrary dimensions. For a general field F, classification of anisotropic quadratic forms is a nontrivial problem. By contrast, the isotropic forms are usually much easier to handle.  By Witt's decomposition theorem, every inner product space over a field is an orthogonal direct sum of a split space and an anisotropic space.

Field theory
 If F is an algebraically closed field,  for example, the field of complex numbers, and  is a quadratic space of dimension at least two, then it is isotropic.
 If F is a finite field and  is a quadratic space of dimension at least three, then it is isotropic (this is a consequence of the Chevalley–Warning theorem).
 If F is the field Qp of p-adic numbers and  is a quadratic space of dimension at least five, then it is isotropic.

Strictureplasty (also spelled Stricturoplasty) is a surgical procedure performed to alleviate bowel narrowing due to scar tissue that has built up in the intestinal wall from inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn's disease. The scar tissue accumulates as a result of repeated damage and healing, with the scarring causing a stricture (a narrowing of the lumen of the bowel). The narrowing can force bowel contents into fissures and ulcers at the site, causing additional damage and narrowing. The surgery restores free flow through the bowel without the need for removing bowel segments (i.e., without bowel resection).

Strictureplasty was first used in Crohn's disease patients about 30 years ago. The first strictureplasty for Crohn's disease was performed by Emanoel Lee in 1976 and was reported in 1982. The course of the following two decades several papers demonstrated that strictureplasties were safe and effective.

Strictureplasties are categorized into three groups: Conventional, intermediate, and complex procedures.  The Heineke-Mikulicz Strictureplasty is the most common among the conventional stricutreplasties. Best-suited for short (up to 7 centimeters) strictures, the H-M Strictureplasty is performed by making a cut lengthwise along one side of the bowel, pushing the two ends of the cut together and then suturing the bowel widthwise (picture), thus, having the effect of widening the segment of narrowed bowel, therefore resolving the stricture.

The Finney Strictureplasty is the most common intermediate strictureplasty. Indicated for strictures up to 15 centimeters, the Finney Strictureplasty is performed by folding the diseased bowel on itself and creating a large opening between the two loops.

For multiple strictures or for longer strictures neither the conventional nor the intermediate strictureplasties are suitable. In these cases surgeons need to use complex procedures. The most common complex strictureplasty is the Michelassi Strictureplasty. In this strictureplasty the long loop of the bowel affected by Crohn's is first divided at its midpoint. The two halves are then moved side to side. A very long opening is created between the two loops, which are then sutured together (Figure 1), (Figure 2), (Figure 3), (Figure 4).

Multiple strictureplasty can be performed in the same patient.  All strictureplasty techniques spare the patient from bowel resections, an important consideration in a chronic recurrent intestinal condition or in patients with short gut. In addition, recent data suggests that strictureplasty has a protective effect on disease recurrence.   Because of the reconfiguration of the bowel, strictureplasty causes slight discontinuities in peristalsis, visible in some imaging tests.
Na Kae is a district (amphoe) in the province Nakhon Phanom in northeast Thailand.

Geography
Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise): Wang Yang, Pla Pak, Renu Nakhon, and That Phanom of Nakhon Phanom Province; Dong Luang of Mukdahan province; and Tao Ngoi and Khok Si Suphan of Sakon Nakhon province.

History
The district dates back to Mueang Kabin (เมืองกบิล), which was deserted after it was invaded by an enemy army. It was later resettled by Lao people.

In 1917 the district's name was changed from Nong Sun (หนองสูง) to Na Kae. The name means 'field of Kae trees' (Combretum quadrangulare), which grew profusely in swampy areas.

Administration

Central administration 
Na Kae is divided into 12 sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 143 administrative villages (mubans).

Missing numbers are tambons which now form Wang Yang district.

Local administration 
There are two sub-district municipalities (thesaban tambons) in the district:
 Na Kae (Thai:) consisting of parts of sub-district Na Kae.
 Phra Song (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Phra Song.

There are 11 subdistrict administrative organizations (SAO) in the district:
 Na Kae (Thai:) consisting of parts of sub-district Na Kae.
 Nong Sang (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Nong Sang.
 Na Khu (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Na Khu.
 Phiman (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Phiman.
 Phum Kae (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Phum Kae.
 Kan Lueang (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Kan Lueang.
 Nong Bo (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Nong Bo.
 Na Liang (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Na Liang.
 Ban Kaeng (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Ban Kaeng.
 Kham Phi (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Kham Phi.
 Si Chomphu (Thai:) consisting of sub-district Si Chomphu.

Economy
Na Kae district is the site of a shuttered 72 million baht solid waste facility built in 2011 and abandoned in 2013. In Ban Phon Sawan, the facility occupies 70 rai. It was designed to serve four districts: Na Kae, That Phanom, Renu Nakhon, and Wang Yang. It suspended operations two years after its launch due to high costs. The facility was designed to separate organic waste from other materials to be turned into fertiliser for sale. Absent the facility, local authorities are struggling to cope with 20 tonnes of garbage per day. Based on an auditor's findings, the facility cannot operate as intended and cannot be fixed or amended for other uses. The auditor recommended that an investigation be carried out to identify those responsible for the problem and seek the return of 72 million baht.
Pampamarca District is the smallest of eight districts in the Canas Province in Peru. Its seat is the village of Pampamarca.

Ethnic groups 
The people in the district are mainly indigenous citizens of Quechua descent. Quechua is the language which the majority of the population (86.85%) learnt to speak in childhood, 12.95% of the residents started speaking using the Spanish language (2007 Peru Census).

The Promise calls for building the tax base in Baltimore City, creating safe school zones in Baltimore modeled after the Harlem Children's Zone, conducting independent audits of all state agencies, and lowering corporate and unemployment taxes among other initiatives. This plan prompted the Baltimore Sun Editorial Board on July 17, 2013, to name George "The leader so far in providing a specific platform". George finished last in the primary, behind Larry Hogan, who won the nomination, David Craig, and Charles Lollar.

Notes and references
Ski Resort Extreme is a computer simulation game which puts the player in charge of creating and running a ski resort. It was developed and released in 2004 by Cat Daddy Games who also developed the very similar Ski Resort Tycoon and Ski Resort Tycoon II.

Ski Resort Extreme puts the player in the shoes of a ski resort developer whose aim is to attract varied groups of skiers and snowboarders by catering to their needs and expectations, be it ski runs, equipment, entertainment or amenities.

Resorts may be started from scratch, with more or less money depending on the difficulty level. Alternatively, players may take challenges where the task is to fix the problems of an existing resort in a specified period of time.

The game also allows the player to create a terrain with the map editor, with the option to import one's own height map.
Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967), was a United States Supreme Court decision invalidating a New York law under the Fourth Amendment, because the statute authorized electronic eavesdropping without required procedural safeguards.

Background
Under New York Code of Criminal Procedure § 813-a, police obtained an ex parte order to bug the office of attorney Ralph Berger. Based on evidence obtained by the surveillance, Berger was convicted of conspiracy to bribe a public official. The statute allowed electronic eavesdropping for up to two months upon a standard of "a reasonable ground to believe that evidence of a crime may be thus obtained." Further two-month extensions of the original order could be granted if investigators made a showing that such surveillance would be in the public interest. The statute required neither notice to the person surveilled nor any justification of such secrecy. The communications sought did not have to be described with any particularity; surveillance requests had to identify only the person targeted and the phone number to be tapped. Finally, the statute did not require a return on the warrant, so law enforcement officers did not have to account to a judge for their use of evidence gathered.

Opinion of the Court
In an opinion written by Justice Tom C. Clark, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that section 813-a violated the Fourth Amendment, made enforceable against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, because it lacked "adequate judicial supervision [and] protective procedures." Notably, the Court invalidated the law on its face rather than as applied to the petitioner. The Court likened such an indiscriminate grant of authority to search for any evidence of any crime to a general warrant, a tool used by British authorities in colonial America that the Fourth Amendment was enacted to outlaw. The Court held that conversations are protected by the Fourth Amendment, and that the use of electronic devices to capture conversations thus constituted a "search." This holding predates by several months the more famous case of Katz v. United States, which extended Fourth Amendment protection to a conversation in a public phone booth based on the speaker's reasonable expectation of privacy.

Legacy 
Academic Colin Agur argues that Berger, along with Katz v. United States, were responses by the Court to police and government abuse of telephone surveillance. Berger, specifically, limited police wiretapping when it struck down the New York statute for being overly broad.
Terry Eviston (born 17 July 1957 in Dublin) was a footballer who played for Home Farm, Bohemians, Athlone Town A.F.C., Dundalk F.C. and two spells with Shamrock Rovers. He is the current manager of Raheny United in the Women's National League (Ireland).

Playing career
Eviston made his League of Ireland debut for Home Farm at Tolka Park on 2 November 1975. On 7 August 1976 Home Farm played Everton in a pre season friendly at Goodison Park. Twenty years later the same club provided the opposition in Eviston's testimonial.

In 1978, he joined Bohemians and was their top scorer in the league in 1980/81 with 9 goals from 20 games (1 as substitute). In total he played 110 league games (99 plus 11 as sub) scoring 31 league goals. He made a scoring debut for Bohs on 10 September 1978. He made 6 appearances in European competition for Bohs against AC Omonia and Dynamo Dresden in the 1978–79 European Cup and Sporting Clube de Portugal in the 1979–80 UEFA Cup.

On 30 April 1980 he represented the League of Ireland against Argentina at the River Plate Stadium where Diego Maradona scored in a 1–0 defeat and on 3 September 1981 Terry was part of a League of Ireland side that played Brazil in Maceió. During that season he was the club captain at Dalymount. His last game for Bohs was the 1983 FAI Cup Final loss.

After five seasons at Dalymount Park Rovers new manager Jim McLaughlin (footballer) signed Terry in July 1983. In his first season at Milltown, Rovers won the League for the first time in twenty years.

After 2 goals in 25 total appearances Terry transferred to Athlone Town A.F.C. in November 1984. He made his debut at Sligo on the 18th and until he signed for Dundalk in the summer of 1986 he played in all 43 league games in that period.

In his seven years at Oriel Park he won the League twice, the FAI Cup once and the League of Ireland Cup twice and won the Soccer Writers' Personality of the Year award in 1987–88. He was also Player of the Month in March 1988. He also made 6 appearances in European competition for Dundalk against AFC Ajax in the 1987–88 European Cup Winners' Cup, against Red Star Belgrade in the 1988–89 European Cup and Budapest Honvéd FC in the 1991–92 European Cup.

In the 1990-91 League of Ireland season Eviston was everpresent in the league scoring 10 goals as Dundalk won the league on the last day at Cork with Eviston playing a role in Tom McNulty's winner.

He rejoined Rovers in the summer of 1993 and scored 6 goals in 25 appearances as he picked up his fourth League medal in his first season back in the Hoops. He made one appearance for Rovers in the 1994-95 UEFA Cup. His last game for Rovers was the final game of the 1995-96 League of Ireland season.

In May 1996 a League of Ireland XI played Everton in Eviston's testimonial at Dalymount Park.

He won an Irish amateur cap against Greece in 1978 and an Olympic cap against Hungary in 1986.

His 101st and last League of Ireland goal was the winner for Cobh against Galway United on 20 September 1997. Cobh goalkeeper Nicky Byrne saved a penalty to ensure the home side their first win of that season.

At the end of the 2012 League of Ireland season Newe is joint forty first in the all-time League of Ireland goalscoring list with 101 league goals

Eviston was naturally left footed and brave in the air, a proficient crosser with close control. His versatility shone through as he played outside left, striker and left back. Passionate and the ultimate team player his goal celebrations were always memorable.

Management career
After the sacking of Ray Treacy in January 1996 Terry, along with Alan O'Neill, was appointed manager of the club.

Alan and Terry were surprisingly sacked after two games of the 1996–97 season. He then went on to be player/manager at Athlone Town F.C. where he scored his 100th league goal.

In June 1999 he was appointed manager of Dundalk who were then in the League of Ireland First Division. In May 2000 his contract was not renewed.

In July 2004 he was appointed assistant to Roddy Collins at Dublin City F.C. In November 2004 both moved to Shamrock Rovers. When Roddy Collins was sacked at the end of that season Terry left the club. Terry is currently manager of Raheny United in the Women's National League (Ireland).

Francesco de Mura (21 April 1696 – 19 August 1782) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque period, active mainly in Naples and Turin. His late work reflects the style of neoclassicism.

Life
Francesco de Mura, also referred to as Franceschiello, was a pupil of Francesco Solimena, then later with Domenico Viola, where he met his contemporary, Mattia Preti.

While still in his teens he painted frescoes (1715) in San Nicola alla Carità in Naples. He painted ten canvases of the Virtues and an Adoration of the Magi (1728) for the church of Santa Maria Donnaromita. His other works include frescoes of the Adoration of the Magi (1732) in the apsidal dome of the church of the Nunziatella. De Mura also painted portraits.

Among his pupils were Pietro Bardellino, Giacinto Diano, Fedele Fischetti, Oronzo Tiso, Nicola Menzele and  Girolamo Starace.

Luis Ricardo Guevara Mora (born 2 September 1961) is a Salvadoran former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

Nicknamed el Negro, he became a member of the El Salvador national team and represented his country at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Guevara remains one of El Salvador's best goalkeepers. He was known for his outstanding reflexes, leaping ability and acrobatic style of play, as well as his controversial antics off the field, which also earned him another nickname, 'el Loco'. He is the all-time cap leader for El Salvador national team.

Club career
In his early years, Guevara was a baseball and basketball enthusiast despite future national team goalkeeper Raúl Antonio García being one of his friends in school. He was tempted to train with Coca-Cola by former national team goalkeeper Raúl Magaña and then joined Platense to make his senior league debut at 16 years. He then played for Atlético Marte. He played for Once Lobos and again for Marte but since the fans still blamed him for the 10–1 drubbing by Hungary he left for Guatemala in the end, to play for Club Xelajú MC and Aurora F.C. He only returned to his country after five years and spent time again at Atlético Marte before retiring at Alianza in 2000. He then became goalkeeper coach at the national team but returned to Atlético Marte as a player-coach when they were relegated to the Salvadoran Second Division. Finally, he retired again at San Salvador F.C. to become a manager.

International career
At the age of 17, he was called up to play a friendly game against Panama in April 1979. He became the youngest goalkeeper in the national team's history.

Prior to the 1982 World Cup finals, during the qualification rounds, he only conceded one goal and played in a memorable victory against Mexico. At the finals tournament in Spain, he became one of the youngest goalkeepers to participate in the World Cup. In the first round, El Salvador lost to Hungary 10–1, and Guevara became the goalkeeper with the most goals scored against in a single match, a record that stands as of 2019.

He played 91 times for his national team in which he earned 50 senior caps. He represented his country in 13 World Cup qualification matches. His final international game was a November 1996 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Panama.

Personal life
Guevara is married to Flor de María and the couple have three children: Luis Ricardo, Ana Luisa and Gabriel Sebastián.

The Cross of Honour for Military Service Abroad is a Belgian military decoration originally established for award to Belgian servicemen who served for a long period of time in the Federal Republic of Germany, Zaire (now Congo), Rwanda or Burundi. It was established on 16 June 1997 in three classes.

Classes and award prerequisites
The Cross of Honour is awarded in three classes based on the duration of service in the relevant territory.  Years of service do not have to be continuous:

 The First Class is awarded for 15 years of service
 The Second Class for 10 years of service
 The Third Class for 5 years of service

However, depending on the region where the services were performed, one year of actual service may count for more than one year for the purpose of awarding the Cross of Honour. One year of service in the Congo, Rwanda or Burundi counted as five years, one year of service at the border between the former West Germany and the former East Germany counted for three years, and one year of service performed in the central region of the former West Germany counted for two years.

Insignia
The medal is a gold star with a red pearl at each tip. The star is suspended to the ribbon by a royal crown and a ring. The obverse bears a central medallion with a golden lion on a black enamelled background surrounded by a ring of blue enamel with the motto in gold letters Pro Patria.  The reverse medallion bears a crown of laurels surrounding two crossed swords. 

The ribbon is azure blue with a purple vertical border on each side and in the centre a vertical stripe the colour of which depends on the class: gold for first class, silver for second class, and red for third class.
The Innkreis Autobahn (A8, Innkreis Motorway) is a motorway, or Autobahn,  in Austria. It runs from the  A1 and A9 junction to the border with Germany.

The last section of motorway was built in 2003. 

Autobahns in AustriaMovieTickets.com is an online movie ticketing website founded by AMC Theatres and Hollywood.com in 2000; CBS Corporation, Famous Players, and National Amusements all came on board prior to launch; and it is now a subsidiary of Fandango Media. MovieTickets.com provides movie times for all theaters, and online ticket purchasing for all Clearview Cinemas and National Amusements theaters, among other smaller chains; such as Mann Theatres in Los Angeles. In 2010, MovieTickets.com sold over 16 million tickets for over 200 exhibitors, with 14,000 screens.

In 2001, Moviefone.com and Movietickets.com entered in a partnership in 2001 that crosslinked their ticketing offerings. In 2004, MovieTickets.com became the exclusive online ticket vendor for Moviefone.com. Then, in mid-2005, MovieTickets.com established a ticket distribution relationship with the consignment ticket reseller PrintTixUSA, adding 20 movie exhibition companies to its ranks and boosting the total number of screens serviced nationwide to more than 10,000. Since then, however, MovieTickets.com had lost ground, losing sole rights to the AMC chain and Moviefone's telephone arm to rival Fandango.

In April 2016, Movietickets.com reported it had provided advance ticketing services to 250 theater chains, representing over 50 percent of the top 100 grossing theaters in North America on any given weekend.

In October 2017, Fandango Media purchased MovieTickets.com. This purchase united the industry's two biggest online movie-ticketing services (Fandango's ticketing network spanned more than 33,000 screens worldwide; MovieTickets.com's over 29,000, with significant overlap between the two, e.g., both companies sold tickets to both AMC and Regal Cinemas) and increased Fandango's global screen count by approximately 20%, to over 40,000 screens worldwide.

Competition with Fandango
Acquisitions and mergers of movie chains have complicated matters regarding which ticketing companies provide online ticketing for a particular theatre chain. MovieTickets.com lost the Hoyts theater chain when the latter was acquired by the Regal Entertainment Group theater chain, a founder of Movietickets.com's rival online ticketing agency Fandango; however, when Regal acquired Consolidated Theatres, the latter retained its contractual relationship with MovieTickets.com.

Prior to 2012, MovieTickets.com provided online ticketing for AMC Theatres except those cinemas originally part of the Loews Cineplex Entertainment chain, whose online ticketing is provided by Fandango due to contractual obligations in place prior to the 2005 merger of the two movie chains. In 2002, Loews had attempted to break the contract under pressure of bankruptcy and from (then) AOL Moviefone and its partner, Loews' Cineplex subsidiary; Fandango successfully sued both Loews and Moviefone, and retained the Loews business. Furthermore, as of February 8, 2012, Fandango began providing ticketing for non-Loews AMC Theatres in the US as well, after which MovieTickets.com's fellow shareholders sued AMC for breach of contract. AMC and MovieTickets.com settled in 2013, with an agreement that the theater chain's online ticketing would be available on both Fandango and MovieTickets.com.

In May 2012, MovieTickets.com's former partner Moviefone announced a new partnership with Fandango, when its relationship with MovieTickets.com lapsed.

In 2015, Regal Entertainment Group announced that they would begin to offer tickets on MovieTickets.com on a non-exclusive basis, as Regal tickets retained their availability on Fandango.

The competition ended with Fandango's purchase of MovieTickets.com in the 4th quarter of 2017.

Solomon R. (Romanovich or Reuvenovich) Grobshtein was born in Baku, Azerbaijan. He became a prominent Soviet scientist, and one of the founders and organizers of the Azeri oil industry.

Solomon was head of the engineering control board in Azerbaijan, authored scientific books and was credited with several inventions, including the Flow Control Valve for Oil and Gas Wells (United States Patent US3332438, published on July 25, 1967) invented by him and his team, which included Abdullaev Asker Alekper Ogly, Alizade Fuad Agasamedovich, Aslanov Mukhtar Makhmud Ogly, Vodovzov Genrikh Zalmanovich, and Ragimova Elmira Mamed Kyzy, at the Nauchno-Issledovatelsky i Proektny Institute.
 
In 1951, he, and the team led by A. K. Aliyev, were awarded the State Premium for achievements in exploration, drilling, production, exploitation, construction of offshore oil wells.

From 1950-54, Solomon Romanovich Grobshtein was elected to the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR.

Solomon was the brother of Borys Grobshtein (Dov Gazit).

The Bruneau hot springsnail, scientific name Pyrgulopsis bruneauensis, is a species of very small freshwater snail that has a gill and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Hydrobiidae. This species is  endemic to the United States, Bruneau River in Idaho.  Its natural habitat is thermal springs. It is threatened by habitat loss.

Description
Pyrgulopsis bruneauensis is a small snail that has a height of  and a globose to broadly conical, medium-sized shell.  Its differentiated from other Pyrgulopsis in that its penial filament has a very short lobe and elongate filament with the penial ornament consisting of small, weakly developed terminal gland.

Distribution
It is only found in geothermal springs and seeps along an  length of the Bruneau River in Southwest Idaho.

Habitat
It prefers wetted rock faces of springs and flowing water, with large cobbles and boulders. The principal threat to the Bruneau hot springsnail is the reduction and/or elimination of its geothermal habitats as a result of groundwater withdrawal, primarily for agriculture. Spring temperatures are the predominant factor that determines the springsnail's distribution and abundance; the springsnail requires constant springwater temperatures to survive.

Conservation
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 5-year Review for the Bruneau hot springsnail in 2007 concluded that the original listing classification as endangered remains unchanged. The threats that were present at the time of the springsnail's listing remain today. In particular, groundwater levels are not stable or increasing and there is a decline in the number of geothermal springs occupied by the springsnail. Bruneau hot springsnail populations show declining trends, and connectivity between the remaining colonies has been reduced. Current conservation measures are falling short of addressing the highest-ranking threats to the species. Despite previous conservation efforts, threats to the Bruneau hot springsnail persist and it is in danger of extinction. However, on January 14, 2019, Idaho lawmakers advanced plans to cap hundreds of artesian wells in the area, improving geothermal aquifer pressure. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working with the State of Idaho and other partners in conservation, including private landowners, toward the shared goal of reducing threats and ultimately recovering this species so that it no longer needs protection under the ESA. Conservation actions include efforts to increase and stabilize geothermal water levels. These actions might include: voluntary conservation easements (lease/purchase water rights), irrigation system improvements to reduce agricultural water use, continued monitoring of water levels and snail distribution, control of non-native fish known to prey upon the springsnail, and establishment of regulatory measures that are adequate to permanently protect the springsnail from future groundwater reductions.

Arsenije ("Arsa") Milosevic (October 1931 – May 2006) was a Yugoslavian (Serbian) film director, television director, librettist and opera director.

Arsenije Arsa Milosevic was a Yugoslavian film, tv, and theatre director. He was also a screenwriter and librettist. Milosevic's career started in the Belgrade Cine-Club. In 1957 he became the first Serbian director to be awarded a prize at the Cannes Film Festival, receiving third place in the experimental film category for his film Orpheus. Afterward, he worked at the Yugoslav State Television (Belgrade radio and television). After the death of his wife Olga, he turned to theatre and wrote the libretto for the opera Gilgamesh, for which Rudolph Brucci composed the music. The Gilgamesh premiere was in 1985. in Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad. Milosevic staged it like a new, contemporary opera, as multimedia with modern set design and choreography. The opera got high rates from critics and the audience. He also wrote a libretto Under the Mephistos Sign, for which the music was composed by a Serbian composer Srdjan Jacimovic. This libretto transposes Goethe's Faust, in the present day, with Dr. Faustus as a beautiful woman. However, this opera never had a premiere.

Built in 1833, it was the home of author and professor William Holmes McGuffey (1800–1873) from then until 1836.  It is believed to be the site where he wrote the first four of the McGuffey Readers,  widely popular instructional texts used to educate generations of Americans.  The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.  It is now operated by Miami University as the William Holmes McGuffey Museum.

Description and history
The William H. McGuffey House is located southeast of uptown Oxford, at the southeast corner of East Spring and South Oak Streets.  It is a two-story brick structure with a gabled roof, and a two-story wood-frame ell extending behind it.  The main roof line has a bracketed cornice in the front, and the side gables are adorned with Gothic style drip moulding.  A single-story porch extends across the front, with a flat roof supported by four Tuscan columns, and a spindled balustrade.  The main facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the left bay, topped by a transom window.  The interior has a restored 19th-century appearance, and includes artifacts generally of that period, as well as items specific to the ownership of William H. McGuffey.

The house was built in 1833 for William H. McGuffey, then a professor at Miami University.  McGuffey had an abiding interest in public education, and it is here that he began to produce and publish the McGuffey Readers, a series of graded instructional texts.  These were hugely popular, selling millions of copies nationwide, and were used by schools as instructional texts into the 20th century.  McGuffey only lived here until 1836, when he moved to Athens.  The house then went through a succession of owners, before it was acquired by the university and restored as a historic house museum.

Island is a thriller novel by American author Richard Laymon, originally published in 1995 by Headline Features. It was reissued in 2002 by Leisure Publishing, with new cover artwork and a foreword by popular suspense novelist Dean Koontz.

Synopsis

The novel is structured as a series of journal entries made by Rupert, a young man who finds himself stranded on an island in the Bahamas (along with six other people) when their yacht mysteriously explodes.  After an ax-wielding maniac claims the lives of two of the castaways, Rupert and the other survivors are forced to try and outwit the mysterious killer in order to save their lives.

Since the concept of the novel is that Rupert is making his journal entries as events happen (with no knowledge as to how future developments in the "plot" will unfold), the reader is left uncertain as to whether any of the book's characters, including Rupert himself, will survive (unlike most first-person narratives, where the survival of the narrator, at least, tends to be a foregone conclusion).  The novel plays with these expectations at several points, with Rupert's life constantly being in danger right alongside those of his compatriots.

Eventually, the women are captured along with other captive women, and Rupert manages to kill the antagonists, one of whom informs him where the prison cells' key is. Rupert informs the prisoners the key is missing, and starts a sexual relationship with his girlfriend's mother. He feeds the women and keeps them as comfortable as possible, and tells via his journal that one day he may even decide check the key's location.

Comparisons to Laymon's other works

The book contains many similarities to Laymon's other novels, including surprising (and often outlandish) plot twists, a sexually depraved villain, portrayal of the heroines as beautiful, strong, and almost Amazonian in stature (despite also being depicted as vulnerable and scantily clad throughout much of the proceedings), and first and foremost, the characterization of Rupert, the protagonist and supposed "hero", who nonetheless displays lecherous tendencies and attitudes which may not be far removed from those of the book's villain.

Front-end loading (FEL), also referred to as pre-project planning (PPP), front-end engineering design (FEED), feasibility analysis, conceptual planning, programming/schematic design and early project planning, is the process for conceptual development of projects in processing industries such as upstream oil and gas, petrochemical, natural gas refining, extractive metallurgy, waste-to-energy, and pharmaceuticals. This involves developing sufficient strategic information with which owners can address risk and make decisions to commit resources in order to maximize the potential for success.

Front-end loading includes robust planning and design early in a project's lifecycle (i.e., the front end of a project), at a time when the ability to influence changes in design is relatively high and the cost to make those changes is relatively low.  It typically applies to industries with highly capital intensive, long lifecycle projects (i.e., hundreds of millions or billions of dollars over several years before any revenue is produced).  Though it often adds a small amount of time and cost to the early portion of a project, these costs are minor compared to the alternative of the costs and effort required to make changes at a later stage in the project.

It also typically uses a stage-gate process, whereby a project must pass through formal gates at well defined milestones within the project's lifecycle before receiving funding to proceed to the next stage of work. The quality of front-end planning can be improved through the use of  PDRI (Project Definition Rating Index) as a part of the stage-gate process.

Front-end loading is usually followed by detailed design or detailed engineering.

FEL Stages 
It is common industry practice to divide front-end-loading activities into three stages: FEL-1, FEL-2, and FEL-3. For each stage, typical deliverables are listed given below :

Another FEL methodology splits the project into four phases:
 FEL-1: Options Study or Index Engineering. This answers the question, "what are my options to achieve my project goals?". For example, in the processing of nickel laterite ore, it might be possible to build either a pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical processing plant. This stage would study both options and recommend the best one based on the specific project requirements. 
 Gate 1: Option Selection. The project owner selects which FEL1 option will be developed further, based on input from their engineers. 
 FEL-2: Feasibility Study or Conceptual Engineering. The selected option is developed up to a pre-defined level of detail not yet sufficient for construction and operation, but enough to develop a cost estimate, a schedule estimate, and to make any critical decisions that will influence the final design of the plant. 
 Gate 2: Approval for Basic Engineering. Based on the conceptual design and cost and schedule estimates, the project owner will decide whether or not to proceed with the plant. 
 FEL-3: FEED (Front-End Engineering Design) or Basic Engineering. The engineering team will now fully design the plant, including the exact specifications for how it will be constructed, commissioned, started up, and operated. The proposed plant will now have a detailed cost estimate and construction schedule.
 Gate 3: Approval for Construction. The project owner will give their approval for building the plant as designed by their engineers. 
 Project Execution and Detailed Engineering. Materials procurement and construction will begin. This stage includes all activities until the plant is started-up and regular operations begin.

The building now houses Cardinal Mccloskey Community Charter Elementary School.

Background 
In the late nineteenth century the Dominican Sisters of Sparkill purchased the Frederick Grote estate, which consisted of an entire city block from East 182 Street to East 183 Street. Frederick Grote was a partner in the firm "F. Grote & Co.", manufacturers of ivory goods. The business was located on 14th Street in Manhattan. Mr. Grote died October 22, 1886. In 1900, a day school was established in the three-story frame servants' house for children of the Parish of St. Martin of Tours. It was called St. Martin's Academy and only served grades 1–6. As enrollment increased, the academy was moved to the brick Victorian Grote mansion.

When the parish decided to establish a parochial school, in 1923, the sisters converted the academy into "Aquinas Hall", a two-year business school for young women. A second building was added in 1929. In the mid-1930s, it was determined that the students would be better served by a four year high school curriculum. A 4-year high school was established in 1939. On September 11, 2002, First Lady Laura Bush visited Aquinas High School.

In June 2020, the school announced that it would close following the 2020–2021 school year due to declining enrollment. While originally designed for 800 students, there were only 200 at the time the closing was announced.  On June 10, 2021, Aquinas graduated its final class.  The building is now home to Cardinal Mccloskey Community Charter School. It is an elementary school, serving members of the community

The Church in Trzęsacz refers to a series of three churches built in Trzęsacz, Poland. The first, constructed of wood, was reportedly built in 1124; the second one, made of bricks, around 1270; and finally the third one, sometime in the late 14th or early 15th century. At that time, it was located almost two kilometers from the sea (according to many sources, 1800 meters). Furthermore, north of Trzęsacz there was another village, which had completely been taken over by water. Originally, the church was Roman Catholic, but in the early 16th century, after the Reformation, it became Protestant. According to some chronicles, it was the third Christian temple in Pomerania.

Abrasion
Over time, the process of abrasion (more generally known as erosion) caused the land surrounding the church to recede at the expense of the Baltic Sea. Year by year, water would come closer; in 1750 the sea was as close as 58 meters, in 1771 parts of the cemetery were swallowed, and 1820 the distance shrank to 13 meters. Finally, on August 2, 1874, the last service took place in the temple. Afterwards, all furnishings were transported to the cathedral in Kamień Pomorski, with the exception of the triptych, which is now kept in a church in Rewal. By 1885 the temple stood over a chasm and, with permission of the Prussian government, it was deprived of the roof and left abandoned.

On the night of April 8–9, 1901 the most vulnerable, northern wall of the church collapsed. During the following years, part by part, most of the construction was swallowed by the sea, which mercilessly moves south, taking away the land. The last drop took place on February 1, 1994, when part of the southern wall collapsed.

According to scientists, since the turn of the 19th century the sea has taken around 40 centimeters of land a year. Over time, local governments – both Prussian and (after 1945) Polish – tried to save the temple with fascine and concrete blocks, but all attempts were unsuccessful. Currently, intensive works are taking place to save the ruin, as this is the only one of its kind in Europe. One of the projects stated that the last remains of the wall should be moved southwards, further away from the sea, but the risk of complete collapse of the ruin was too high.

Nadjim "Jimmy" Abdou (born 13 July 1984) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Starting his career in his hometown club of Martigues, Abdou later went on to play in Ligue 1 with Sedan before moving to England with Plymouth Argyle. From 2008 to 2017, he played for Millwall, where he scored nine goals in 342 appearances. In 2018, Abdou returned to Martigues.

Born in France, Abdou is Comorian through his parents. He made his international debut for the Comoros in October 2010, and played for his nation at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.

Club career

Early career
Born in Martigues, Bouches-du-Rhône, Abdou started out with his home-town club Martigues, first joining the side when he was seven years old. After progressing through the ranks, Abdou was promoted to the first team in 2002 and spent one season with them, making twenty–six appearances and scoring two times.

Sedan
After one season at Martigues, Abdou joined Sedan on 25 July 2003.

Abdou appeared in the first team as an unused substitute in the opening game of the season, in a 2–0 loss against Istres. Afterwards, Abdou spent six months, playing for the reserve side before getting his first team opportunity. It was not until on 6 December 2003 when he made his Sedan debut, starting the whole game, in a 0–0 draw against Grenoble. At the end of the 2003–04 season, Abdou went on to make eighteen appearances for the side.

In the 2004–05 season, Abdou became a first team regular for the side and featured in a number of matches throughout the season. Abdou then scored his first goal for the club on 12 November 2004, in a 2–0 win over Montpellier. For his performance, he signed a two–year contract with the club the following month. His second goal for the club came on 25 January 2005, in a 2–1 win over Amiens. At the end of the 2004–05 season, Abdou went on to make thirty–six appearances and scoring two times for the side.

In the 2005–06 season, Abdou found himself behind the pecking order in the first team and came on as a substitute in number of matches, due to his poor performances. This also combined with his own injury concern. At the end of the 2005–06 season, making fifteen appearances, the club was promoted to Ligue 1 after three seasons in Ligue 2.

In the 2006–07 season, Abdou missed the first half of the season, due to being suspended and playing in the club's reserve side. It was not until on 18 November 2006 when he made his first Ligue 1 appearance of the season, coming on as a substitute for Jérôme Le Moigne in the 49th minute, and scored an own goal, in a 1–0 loss against Lyon. Abdou became a first team regular for the side since returning from the sideline. However, later in the season, he soon found himself out of the first team, due to being suspended. Abdou played one season in Ligue 1 in Sedan finished in 19th place and were relegated.

Following the club's relegation, Abdou was released by the club. He then joined Clermont on a free transfer, signing a one–year contract. However, the move was denied by the club, themselves.

Plymouth Argyle
After a trial in the summer of 2007, Abdou joined English Football League Championship club Plymouth Argyle, signing on a free transfer on 20 August until the end of the 2007–08 season.

He made his first league appearance on 25 August 2007 as a 62nd-minute substitute in a 3–2 defeat at Barnsley. However, Abdou found himself out of the first team between September and November, due to strong competitions in the club's midfield position. It was not until on 6 November 2007 when he returned to the first team from the sidelines, starting a match before being substituted in the 58th minute, in a 1 –1 draw against Colchester United. Since returning to the first team from the sidelines, Abdou regained his first team place for the side and began playing in the right–back position for the rest of the season. He scored his first goal in English football against Scunthorpe United in a 3–0 win at Home Park on 1 December 2007. As a result, Abdou was nominated for the club's Player of the Month for December but lost out to Sylvan Ebanks-Blake. He then scored his second goal for the club in the third round of the FA Cup on 5 January 2008, in a 3–2 win over Hull City. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Abdou went on to make thirty–three appearances and scoring two times for the side.

After contract discussions in April 2008, Abdou left Plymouth in June 2008 after turning down the club's contract offer and signed for Millwall on 3 July 2008.

Millwall
Abdou made his Millwall debut, starting a match before being substituted in the 75th minute, in a 4–3 loss against Oldham Athletic in the opening game of the season. Since joining Millwall, he quickly became a fan favourite among Millwall's supporters. Abdou's signature has turned out to be something of a coup for manager Kenny Jackett. In spite of one or two short-term injuries, Abdou has been successful at Millwall, holding down a regular first team slot in central midfield when fit. It was not until on 11 October 2008 when he scored his first Millwall goal, in a 3–1 win against Tranmere Rovers. However, in a 1–0 win over Hereford United on 28 October 2008, Abdou was sent–off in the 49th minute for a "double-footed lunge" on Clint Easton and served a two match suspension. He made his return from suspension on 22 November 2008, coming on as a second-half substitute, in a 0–0 draw against Leyton Orient. At the beginning of January, Abdou missed three matches through injury and made his return on 17 January 2009, coming on as a substitute in the second half, in a 1–0 win over Tranmere Rovers. He later scored twice for the club, in a 4–2 loss against Bristol Rovers on 18 April 2009. Abdou scored the winning goal in the League One Playoff Semi-finals against Leeds United at Elland Road on 14 May 2009 to send them to Wembley for their first ever playoff final, which they lost 3–2 to Scunthorpe United. Abdou later reflected that scoring against Leeds United was a turning point of his career. After missing out on promotion during the 2008–09 season, he went on to make forty–three appearances and scoring four times in his first season at Millwall.

At the start of the 2009–10 season, Abdou scored in Millwall's first game of the season against Southampton, with a header, it turned out to be his only goal of the season. However, shortly after, he suffered an injury during a 4–0 win over AFC Bournemouth and was sidelined for weeks. Abdou made his return from injury, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw against Brighton & Hove Albion on 29 August 2009. His performance saw him signed a contract extension, keeping him until 2013. During a 4–4 draw against local rivals Charlton Athletic on 19 December 2009, Abdou was sent–off for a professional foul in the 37th minute. Charlton successfully converted the resulting penalty. But he did not serve a match ban and returned in a next match on 26 December 2009 against Norwich City, which they lost 2–0. Abdou continued to establish himself in the first team, playing in the midfield position for the rest of the season and later helped play a big part in earning Millwall promotion later in the 2009–10 season. Millwall were eventually promoted after beating Swindon Town in the play-off final. At the 2009–10 season, Abdou went on to make fifty–two appearances and scoring once for the side.

After missing the opening game of the season, due to injury he sustained in a friendly match against Hearts, Abdou made his first appearance of the 2010–11 season, starting the whole game, in a 4–0 win over Hull City on 14 August 2010. He then set up a goal for Liam Trotter to score the club's second goal of the game, in a 3–1 win over Coventry City on 28 August 2010. Abdou continued to establish himself in the first team, playing in the midfield position for the side. This lasted until he sustained a knee injury during a 2–1 loss against Reading on 22 February 2011 and was sidelined for a month. It was not until on 16 April 2011 when Abdou returned from injury, starting the match before being substituted at half time, in a 2–1 loss against Coventry City, having appeared in the substitute bench for the last two matches. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Abdou went on to make thirty–six appearances for the side.

In the 2011–12 season, Abdou started out when he came on as a substitute at the start of the season. Abdou soon continued to establish himself in the first team, playing in the midfield position for the side. During the season, he faced injury concerns on three occasions. Despite this, Abdou continued to be featured in the first team for the side and was praised by Manager Jackett. In April 2012, Abdou was named as the club's Player of the Year for the 2011–12 season after a vote by Millwall's supporters. "I would like to thank all the fans who voted for me, and my team mates as well because this is a team game," he said after hearing of the award. At the end of the 2011–12 season, making forty–five appearances for the side, the club began talks with Abdou over a new contract. Following this, it was reported that Abdou received treatment over his injury he sustained over the summer.

In the 2012–13 season, Abdou continued to establish himself in the first team, playing in the midfield position for the side and formed a partnership with Josh Wright. During a match against Bolton Wanderers on 6 October 2012, Abdou suffered ankle injury and played through the game, as Millwall won 2–1. He soon recovered after a two weeks international break and started the whole game, in a 2–2 draw against rivals, Crystal Palace on 20 October 2012. Following this, Abdou signed a two–year contract with the club, keeping him until 2015. After missing two matches in mid–December, due to suspension and given a compassionate leave, Abdou then appointed as a captain in a FA Cup match, in a 1–0 win over Preston North End. After the match, he said that given the captaincy was an honour for him. He again captained the side once again on 16 February 2013 against Luton Town in the fifth round of the FA Cup and beat them 3–0 to progress to the next round. Three days later on 19 February 2013, Abdou captained the side for the third time this season, in a 5–1 loss against Peterborough United on 16 February 2013. AManager Jackett mentioned Abdou in the post-game interview, quoting: "You could see the danger from the sidelines – not enough players on the pitch could sense that danger and were able to react or cut the ball out – probably Jimmy Abdou apart." After appearing two matches as an unused substitute in early–April, Abdou scored on his return to the starting line-up, in a 2–1 loss against Sheffield Wednesday on 9 April 2013. At the end of the 2012–13 season, making 39 appearances and scoring once, Kenny Jackett, a manager who signed him, left the club.

At the start of the 2013–14 season, Abdou found himself on the substitute bench under the new management of Steve Lomas. By September, he regained his first team place, playing in the midfield position. His return performance received praises by Manager Lomas, saying: "He is a better player than he is given him credit for and he can pass the ball. I keep hearing people say he can't pass the ball. I watch him in training every day and he can pass the ball. He has bided his time, got in the team and like I’ve said to the lads when you are in the team, keep the shirt." Abdou then set up a goal for Scott Malone to score the club's second goal of the game, in a 2–0 win over Leeds United on 28 September 2013. However, he was sent–off for a second bookable offence in the 85th minute, in a 1–1 draw against Reading on 26 October 2013. After sustaining from a groin injury, Abdou returned to the first team and started a number of matches from December and January. However, he soon lost his first team place following the new management of Ian Holloway and found himself in the substitute bench later in the season. Despite this, Abdou appeared in the four times first team under Holloway and finished the 2013–14 season, making twenty–seven appearances.

In the 2014–15 season, Abdou started the first five matches at the start of the season before missing out three matches, due to being given a compassionate leave. He then returned to the starting line–up, starting the whole game, in a 3–2 loss against Reading on 16 September 2014. A week later on 27 September 2014, Abdou played in the right–back position for the first time, starting the whole game, in a 2–1 loss against Huddersfield Town. Due to facing competition in the midfield position, Holloway acknowledged his first team status, saying: "Abdou was playing very well in midfield so I don't know what I'll do with him. I was really surprised by how well he did against Forest – against one of the best wingers in the division." As a result, he soon lost his first team place as a result and this lasted until December. Abdou made his return to the first team, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1–0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion on 12 December 2014. He regained his first team place in the midfield position for the side since returning to the first team and partnered with Shaun Williams. After being dropped on the substitute bench for one match, Abdou then switched to the right–back position for four matches. Towards the end of the 2014–15 season, he then reverted to his midfield position. It was not until on 14 April 2015 when Abdou scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win over Wigan Athletic. However, the club was relegated after five seasons in the Championship after Rotherham United's 2–1 win against Reading on 28 April 2015. At the end of the 2014–15 season, making thirty–seven appearances and scoring once for the side, Abdou was named as the club's Player of the Year once again for the 2014–15 season after a vote by Millwall's supporters, as well as, winning two more awards. He was also signed a two–year contract extension after being offered by the club.

Having missed the first three matches of the 2015–16 season, due to a hamstring injury, Abdou made his first appearance of the season, starting the whole game, in a 3–2 loss against Barnsley on 18 August 2015. Since returning from injury, he quickly regained his first team place for the side, playing in the midfield position. It was not until on 26 September 2015 when Abdou scored his first Millwall goal, in a 3–1 win over Rochdale.

I'm always on at Jim – and I’ve known him a long time – about finishing, finishing, finishing. The way we play and the form we’ve been in over the last 10 months our midfield players should be scoring goals. Jimmy had three really good opportunities last week (against Nottingham Forest) that could have won us the game comfortably, and he didn't take them. So I'm really pleased that he scored."

Mychonastes is a genus of green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. It is the sole genus of the family Mychonastaceae.

In 2011, Krienitz et al. proposed that Pseudodictyosphaerium be combined with Mychonastes into a single genus; since the latter genus was published earlier in 1978, its name has priority, therefore making Pseudodictyosphaerium a synonym of Mychonastes.

WYZE (1480 kHz) is a gospel AM radio station licensed to Atlanta, Georgia broadcasting  with 10,000 watts of power during daytime hours, and only 44 watts of power during nighttime hours with a non-directional antenna pattern. The station is owned by Ray Neal, through licensee New Ground Broadcasting, LLC.

History
WYZE signed on March 16, 1956. The 1480 kHz frequency was previously used by WAGA, which moved to 590 kHz in 1942; despite using the same frequency, WYZE has no connection to WAGA, which has since become WDWD. WYZE broadcast during daytime hours with what appears to be an adult standards radio format popular during the 1950s. Fay Fueller hosted a romantic music show consisting of poetry and music in 1958.

In 1968, the station switched from a country music format to country/gospel. The station aired a "Town and Country" radio format by 1970.  During the early 1970s the station flipped to an all-news radio format for a time, one of the first in the Atlanta radio market. In 1980, WYZE changed to a gospel format relying mainly on brokered programming.

WYZE went silent in November 2018 due to technical problems that would have required cost-prohibitive repairs. It was reported that then-owner GHB Broadcasting intended to sell WYZE's existing property and relocate, and had also received offers for the station's license and equipment. Effective May 30, 2019, GHB Broadcasting consummated the sale of WYZE to New Ground Broadcasting, LLC.
Creag Mhòr is a mountain in the Breadalbane region of the Scottish Highlands. It is in the Forest of Mamlorn, ten kilometres northeast of Tyndrum, and is one of the remotest of the southern Highlands Creag Mhòr reaches a height of 1047 metres (3435 ft) and qualifies as a Munro and a Marilyn. It is often climbed with the neighbouring Munro of Beinn Heasgarnich; the two mountains form the high ground between Glen Lochay and Loch Lyon.

Landscape 
Creag Mhòr comes from Gaelic and means "big rocky hill", referring to a series of rocky buttresses near the summit. Creag Mhòr is composed of three ridges, the ESE ridge (Sròn nan Eun) descends to Glen Lochay at the habitation of Batavaime and gives the usual route of ascent from that glen. Another ridge also descends to Glen Lochay, this initially goes south from the summit before swinging SE down steep slopes, which need care, to reach the glen. These two ridges enclose Coire Cheathaich (Misty Corrie), a former royal hunting ground which was made famous by Duncan Ban MacIntyre, the Scottish Gaelic poet who worked as a gamekeeper in the area. He wrote the poem Òran Coire a' Cheathaich (Song of the misty corrie) which gives a  natural description of the corrie and its flora and fauna and includes the line "'S rìomhach còta na Creige Mòire" (lovely is the coat of Creag Mhòr).

The south ridge includes the subsidiary summit of Stob nan Clach (956 m) which is listed as a top in Munro's Tables and is reached from the main summit by contouring round the head of Coire Cheathaich for a kilometre. A third ridge on the mountain goes north over the 895 metre subsidiary top of Meall Tionail (Hill of the Gathering) before dropping down to Glen Lyon. This north ridge can be used for access to or from Beinn Heasgarnich, as the ridge can be left after a short distance and Heasgarnich can be reached by going east over the boggy Bealach na Baintighearna (654 m). All rainfall on Creag Mhòr drains to the east coast of Scotland at the Firth of Tay, either via Glen Lyon or Glen Lochay.

Meall Tionail has an unusual geographic feature on its western slopes, it is marked on OS maps as Coire Chirdle, however it is not a corrie in the usual sense as there is no hollow cavity in the mountain. Instead there is a clearly marked semi circle (see picture) called an arcuate scarp below which is a bulge. This was probably created after the last ice age when the unstable hillside saturated by meltwater slipped down the steep slope. The nationally rare plant Bartsia Alpina grows on the slopes of Creag Mhòr, it is found as high as 950 metres, the highest occurrence in the U.K. It grows on brown loam soil on the mountains alkaline mica-schist rock.

Climbing 
Creag Mhòr is a rather isolated mountain and approaches require quite long walks to reach the foot of the hill. Ascents are possible from both the east and the west with the eastern approach from the road end in Glen Lochay being the most popular with guide book writers. This eastern approach starts at Kenknock (grid reference) which is now the farthest it is possible to drive up Glen Lochay with locked gates stopping cars from going any further, however it is viable to use a mountain bike. It is a six kilometre journey west up the glen to reach Batavaime at the foot of the SE ridge from where the mountain can be climbed.

The approach from the west starts at Auch (grid reference) on the A82 and goes under the viaduct of the West Highland Line, then SE up Glen Coralan and over the Corbett of Cam Chreag to reach Creag Mhòr. If continuing to Beinn Heasgarnich from the summit, a direct line NE is not recommended because the hillside is steep and rocky, instead use the north ridge as mentioned before heading east to the col between the two mountains to avoid dangerous ground.

"You're a Friend of Mine" is a 1985 hit song, written by Narada Michael Walden and Jeffrey Cohen, with lead vocals by Clarence Clemons and Jackson Browne in a duet. At the time of the song's release, Clemons was already well known nationally as the saxophonist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. The song was released on Clemons's solo album Hero (1985). Browne's then-girlfriend Daryl Hannah provides background vocals and appears in the song's music video painting and later filming the duo. Also appearing in the video is a backing band, including songwriter Walden on drums. The B-side was "Let the Music Say It", a non-album track written by Clemons and Michael Jonzun.

The song was a commercial success, reaching the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 (#18), Mainstream Rock (#16), and the top 40 on the Adult Contemporary (#21) charts in the U.S. The song also reached the top 20 in Ireland on the Irish Singles Chart (#18).

A live version of the song was recorded on Clemons's 2004 album with Temple of Soul entitled Live in Asbury Park, Vol. 2.

This song was used by the World Wrestling Federation (WWE) in early 1986, to cement a storyline involving a feud between "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and "Ace" Cowboy Bob Orton, culminating with a montage of their work together from 1984 to 1986. It was also used again on 02/03/1989 on NBC's The Main Event to show the close friendships of The Mega Powers: Hulk Hogan, Randy "Macho Man" Savage, and Miss Elizabeth.

San Antonio is a large district in Oakland, California, encompassing the land east of Lake Merritt to Sausal Creek.  It is one of the most diverse areas of the city. It takes its name from Rancho San Antonio, the name of the land as granted to Luís María Peralta by the last Spanish governor of California.

History
The settlement that became San Antonio began in 1851 when J. B. Larue purchased  Peralta's land west of San Antonio Creek. The site was west of Clinton.  Larue built a store and wharf and the community grew up around them.  The San Francisco and Oakland Railroad built a station at San Antonio. When the Central Pacific Railroad took over the line in 1870, the name was changed to Brooklyn. When the Southern Pacific Railroad took over the line in 1883, the name was changed to East Oakland.

Clinton and San Antonio joined in 1856 to form a new town called Brooklyn named after the ship that had brought Mormon settlers to California in 1846. Brooklyn joined with nearby Lynn to incorporate in 1870 under the name Brooklyn. In 1872, Brooklyn voters approved their city's annexation by Oakland.

Neighborhoods
The district is made up of a number of smaller neighborhoods, each with its own distinct personality, history and demographics.

Bella Vista
Cleveland Heights
Clinton
East Peralta/Eastlake
Highland Park
Highland Terrace
Ivy Hill
Jingletown
Lynn
Meadow Brook

Cleveland Heights
Cleveland Heights, also known as Haddon Hill by local realtors, is located at the northwestern corner of the San Antonio district, perched on a hill overlooking Lake Merritt.  It was formerly the township of Brooklyn prior to its annexation by Oakland in 1909. The neighborhood is commonly known as the area encompassed by Lakeshore Avenue on Lake Merritt, East 18th Street, Park Boulevard, and MacArthur Boulevard/I-580 MacArthur Freeway. The neighborhood includes Oakland High School in the east corner of the neighborhood. It is commonly known as China Hill because of the large Chinese population that lives there.

Eastlake
The Eastlake district, formerly known as East Peralta, comprises the area along International Blvd. between 1st and 14th Avenues.  It is currently the site of an ethnic enclave, housing many immigrants of southeast Asian origin. East 12th Street has a large Vietnamese American population, and has many Vietnamese restaurants and businesses, giving it the nickname Little Saigon, which he local Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce is working to elevate into a formal designation by the city and to promote through a Business Improvement District. There is a Vietnamese American Community Center located at International Boulevard. There are also sizable populations of Cambodian Americans and Laotian Americans.

Highland Park
Highland Park is the area immediately surrounding Highland Hospital, loosely bounded by 14th Avenue on the south, 10th Avenue to the north, East 31st Street to the east and Foothill Blvd to the west.  It is known as Funktown to Oakland residents. The name Funktown derives from the name of a local gang Funktown USA that once occupied the area. The gang was a notorious rival of Felix Mitchell's 6-9 Mob as the two struggled for control over the East Oakland drug trade. As Funktown USA's membership dwindled in the late 1980s. East Oakland residents simply referred to the Highland Park and China Hill neighborhoods as "Funktown". Funktown's boundaries are east of 7th Avenue and west of 19th Avenue, South of East 31st Street and North of International Boulevard. 

The majority of Highland Park's residents are ethnic minorities, with a relatively even split between Latinos, Asians, and African-Americans.

Jingletown

The subsection of the neighborhood adjacent to the Oakland Estuary is called Jingletown, also called "JT" by East Oakland natives.
The name originated from long ago when there was a Portuguese community in the area and men would gather around on the street corners chatting amongst each other with their hands in their pockets jingling coins.

Lynn
Lynn was an early settlement, located northeast of Brooklyn.  In 1870, Lynn and Brooklyn incorporated as Brooklyn In 1872, voters approved the annexation by Oakland.  Lynn hosted a large shoe and boot factory, and was named after Lynn, Massachusetts which also had a large footwear industry.

The Twomps
"The Twomps" is a local name for the neighborhood between 20th and 29th Avenues. It is also known as "The Rolling '20s", "The Roaring '20s", or "Murder Dubbs", references to its history of drug trafficking and gang violence. The area was known as The Twomps in the 1980s, but became known as Murder Dubs in the early 1990s due to a dramatic rise in drug-related violence.

The landmark avenue for the Twomps is 23rd Avenue, which also serves as the primary thoroughfare for which Twomps residents get to other main city boulevards. 23rd Avenue is heavily traveled on for its numerous stores, laundromats, and other neighborhood services.

Usmar Ismail (20 March 1921 – 2 January 1971) was an Indonesian film director, author, journalist and revolutionary of Minangkabau descent. He is widely regarded as the native Indonesian pioneer of the cinema of Indonesia.

Biography
Ismail was born in 1921 in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra. His father, Datuk Tumenggung Ismail, taught at the medical school in Padang. His brother Abu Hanifah was also a well-known revolutionary and writer. Ismail attended ASM-A Yogyakarta and later obtained a B.A. in cinematography from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1952.

Ismail initially served in the army during the Dutch colonial rule. He served in the Indonesian army in Yogyakarta. During this time, he was a co-founder of a newspaper called Rakyat, meaning "people" or "populace" in Bahasa Indonesia. He worked as the head of the Indonesian Journalists Association in 1946 and 1947. In 1948, he was arrested while working at national news agency Antara for covering Dutch-Indonesian negotiations.

After his release, Ismail's interest in filmmaking developed more seriously. He became active in a number of film and theater groups, including the Yogyakarta Union of Playwrights, the Indonesian National Academy of Theater, and the National Film Industry Conference Body (Indonesian: Badan Musyawarah Perfilman Nasional). He is well-known as one of the founders of Indonesian National Film Corporation, together with Djamaluddin Malik and others involved in the film industry. 

Ismail was also active in politics. He served as the chief of the Indonesian Association of Muslim Artists (Indonesian: Lembaga Seniman Muslimin Indonesia, or Lesbumi). He was also involved with Nahdatul Ulama and served in the People's Consultative Assembly from 1966–1969. 

Following his dream of becoming a film director, he established  "Perfini Studios", Indonesia's first film studios, in the early fifties. One of his early films, Darah dan Doa (English: Blood and Prayer), is considered the first truly Indonesian film. 

Many of Ismail's films faced criticism from the government and censorship. His 1962 film Anak Perawan di Sarang Penyamun (English: The Virgen in the Robber's Nest) was boycotted by the Communist Party of Indonesia (Indonesian: Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI), as the film was judged take a position too supportive of Malaysia. It remained blacklisted by the New Order government after the 1965-66 Communist purges due to one of the leading actor's links to the PKI.

He was perhaps best known internationally for his 1961 film Fighters for Freedom, which documented Indonesian independence from the Dutch and French. The film was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival, making it the first Indonesian-directed film to appear in an international film festival. 

A concert hall known as the Usmar Ismail Hall, which gives musical, opera and theatrical performances, was established in his name in Jakarta.

He died on 2 January 1971 of a stroke in Jakarta. He is buried in TPU Karet Bivak in Jakarta.

Tribute
On 20 March 2018, Google celebrated his 97th birthday with a Google Doodle.

Usmar Ismail became one of four individuals awarded by President Joko Widodo as a National Hero of Indonesia in Indonesia's Heroes Day of 2021.

Burton M. Tansky (born November 30, 1937, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is an American department store executive who  retired as  president and chief executive officer of The Neiman Marcus Group summer  of 2010.

Before being named CEO in May 2001, he was the company's president and chief operating officer. He was executive vice president from February 1998 until December 1998 and he served as chairman and chief executive officer of Neiman Marcus Stores, the $2.14 billion retail operating division of the company, from May 1994 until February 1998. He also served as chairman and chief executive officer of Bergdorf Goodman from 1990 until 1994. Previously, he served as president of Saks Fifth Avenue.

A 1961 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, Tansky began his career in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as an assistant buyer at Kaufmann's. He also worked for Filene's (Boston, Massachusetts), Rike's (Dayton, Ohio), Forbes & Wallace (Springfield, Massachusetts), I. Magnin (San Francisco, California), and Saks Fifth Avenue (New York City) before joining the Neiman Marcus Group in 1990.

Tansky has been accorded numerous honors, among them the Superstar Award from Fashion Group International in 2006, a Visionaries! Award in 2005 from the Museum of Arts and Design, the 2004 Gold Medal Award from the National Retail Federation (considered the highest honor in retailing), and, in 2002, appointment as a “Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur” by the French government for his promotion of French-made merchandise in America. He has also been honored for his work with the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR).

Burton Tansky was born to Harry and Jeannette Tansky, who, fleeing religious persecution, immigrated to Pittsburgh from Poland and Russia respectively in the early 20th century. The couple operated a hair salon in the fashionable William Penn Hotel in Downtown, Pittsburgh. They raised three children, Burt, Shirley, and Eva, in the neighborhood of East Liberty. Burton is a graduate of Peabody High School.
The Red Line is one of three light rail routes on the METRORail network operated by METRO in Houston, Texas. It is the oldest line in the METRORail system, with the first  section of the line between Fannin South and UH–Downtown opening on January 1, 2004.

Construction on a  extension to the north began July 2009, and was expected to continue until 2014, though the opening date was later pushed back to 2015. On December 8, 2011, the FTA announced the award of a $450 million grant from the New Starts transit program to fund construction of the Red Line. Better than expected construction progress eventually led to the new line opening ahead of schedule on December 21, 2013.

Route
The approximately  Red Line runs through the heart of the historic North Side, a storied neighborhood rooted in rail that came into being with the expansion, in the 1880s, of the Hardy Rail Line. It largely parallels Interstate 45.

Description

Starting at Fannin South, the Red Line travels parallel to Fannin Street, crossing under I-610, until it shifts onto Greenbriar Drive. It turns onto South Braeswood Boulevard briefly before returning to Fannin Street, which it follows through the Texas Medical Center. Through the Museum District, trains travel on one-way streets: southbound trains use Fannin Street, while northbound trains move onto San Jacinto Street. The tracks rejoin just south of I-69 before merging onto Main Street, which it follows through Midtown and Downtown. Along this stretch, the line intersects with the eastbound Green Line and Purple Line at Rusk Street and the westbound lines at Capitol Street. The tracks eventually move onto the west side of Main Street as they approach  station, the original terminus of the line, located adjacent to the University of Houston–Downtown campus.

Since 2013, the Red Line continues north, following Main Street through the Burnett Transit Center and on to Boundary Street, where it crosses east to Fulton Street, and proceeds north on Fulton through the Near Northside to its current terminus at the Northline Transit Center, located adjacent to the Northline campus of the Houston Community College.

Infrastructure

As with the other METRORail lines, the Red Line is predominantly at-grade and street running, with paved tracks laid down the median of Main Street in downtown, Fannin Street to the south, and Fulton Street to the north. These tracks are not physically separated from road traffic, though they are located in dedicated lanes and trains receive priority at intersections at cross-streets by means of preempted traffic signals. However, flashing grade crossing signals and gates are present where trains cross parallel traffic lanes as they move from one street to another, and along the section of the line south of Old Spanish Trail, where tracks are laid out on a right-of-way parallel to the road rather than in the median. Two sections along the Red Line extension north of UH–Downtown, though, are located on elevated structures: the Burnett Transit Center and the tracks leading to and from it, and a grade-separated crossing of a freight line along Fulton Street south of the Northline Transit Center.

The line is fully double-tracked, with stations mainly consisting of a single island platform serving trains in both directions outside the central section along Main Street. However, the Main Street section of the line have split platform designs where platforms are located on both sides of a cross-intersection between the two tracks, each of which serve trains in one direction only, as do the side platforms on parallel streets at Museum District station.

Rolling stock
Services on the Red Line are operated mainly by Metro's two generations of Siemens S70 LRVs: the H1 series delivered in 2004 for the opening of the initial section, the H2 series delivered in 2012 for the Northline extension and the H4 in 2022 for future expansions. Since 2015, H3 series CAF Urbos LRVs, which are mostly used on the Green and Purple Lines, can also been found on the Red Line. Trains are generally formed by two units coupled together.

Stations
The following is a list of stations for this line, listed in order from north to south.

Expansion 
A possibility for expansion of the line would take the route to George Bush Intercontinental Airport.
In enzymology, a 2-hydroxypyridine 5-monooxygenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-hydroxypyridine + AH2 + O2  2,5-dihydroxypyridine + A + H2O

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2-hydroxypyridine, an electron acceptor AH2, and O2, whereas its 3 products are 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, the reduction product A, and H2O.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-hydroxypyridine,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (5-hydroxylating). This enzyme is also called 2-hydroxypyridine oxygenase.
Ture Sigvard "Thure" Sjöstedt (28 August 1903 – 2 May 1956) was a Swedish wrestler.

Career 
In freestyle wrestling, he won a gold and a silver medal in the 1928 and 1932 Summer Olympics, respectively, as well as a European title in 1934. He finished second at the 1927 European Championships in Greco-Roman wrestling.

In the mid-1930s Sjöstedt turned professional and toured the United States with teammate Johan Richthoff. He later developed alcoholism problems and was eventually found dead in his garden cottage.
Vital Voices Global Partnership is an American international, 501(c)(3), non-profit, non-governmental organization that works with women leaders in the areas of economic empowerment, women's political participation, and human rights. The organization is headquartered in Washington, D.C.

History

The nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership grew out of the U.S. government's Vital Voices Democracy Initiative. The Vital Voices Democracy Initiative was established in 1997 by First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, following the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing to promote the advancement of women as a U.S. foreign policy goal. The first Vital Voices Democracy Initiative conference was held in 1997 in Vienna, and hosted by U.S. Ambassador to Austria Swanee Hunt.

The Vital Voices Democracy Initiative led to the creation of Vital Voices Global Partnership as a nonprofit non-governmental organization (NGO) in March 1999.

Former Hillary Clinton aide and chief of staff Melanne Verveer is co-founder of the global partnership and its board chair emeritus. Other co-founders were Alyse Nelson (current President of Vital Voices Global Partnership), Donna McLarty, Mary Yerrick, and Theresa Loar.  Loar was the founding President of the Vital Voices Global Partnership  and also served as Director of the Vital Voices Democracy Initiative at the U.S. Department of State, the Senior Coordinator for International Women's' Issues at the U.S. Department of State and Director of the President's Interagency Council on Women.

Besides Clinton, honorary chairs include current and former U.S. Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Nancy Kassebaum Baker.

Funding has come from a variety of sources, including individual donations; corporate sponsors such as ExxonMobil, Standard Chartered Bank, and Bank of America; foundations such as the Avon Foundation for Women and Humanity United.

In 2002 Vital Voices was asked by First Lady Laura Bush to drive the effort to supply school uniforms to the many girls returning to school for the first time following the  U.S. led overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan.

In May 2022, Vital Voices opened its new global headquarters at 1509 16th Street, NW, in Washington, D.C..

Mission and programs

Vital Voices' website states that its mission is "to identify, invest in and bring visibility to extraordinary women around the world by unleashing their leadership potential to transform lives and accelerate peace and prosperity in their communities."

Vital Voices works in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africa, focusing on the business, political and civil society sectors. The organization regularly hosts international forums, capacity-building workshops, and training seminars for women.

Vital Voices’ Human Rights program currently focuses on combating human trafficking and other forms of violence against women and girls.

Global Leadership Awards

Vital Voices hosts the annual Global Leadership Awards, honoring women leaders working in the areas of human rights, economic empowerment, or political reform. The 2009 ceremony was described as that year's "Most Inspirational Event" in Washington, D.C., in an article in Washington Life Magazine.

No. 360 Squadron RAF was an electronic countermeasures (ECM) squadron of the Royal Air Force.

History
The squadron was created from the merger of the personnel of 831 Naval Air Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm (previously operating the Fairey Gannet ECM.6) and 'B' Flight, No. 97 Squadron RAF (flying English Electric Canberras) at RAF Watton on 1 April 1966. Initially it was known as Joint Electronic Warfare Trials and Training Force before being given its official designation of No. 360 [RN/RAF] Squadron on 23 September 1966. The squadron flew a number of Canberra types: B.2s, T.4s (for pilot training); a B.6; PR.7s and E.17s. The first Canberra T.17 was delivered just before Christmas 1966 and this type soldiered on until disbandment in 1994.

A sister squadron, No. 361 Squadron RAF was also formed in January 1967 for deployment to the Far East. However, following the 1967 Defence Review, 361 Squadron became redundant and was officially disbanded in July the same year.

No. 360 Squadron moved to RAF Cottesmore in April 1969. The official squadron badge was awarded in 1973: the trident represents the Royal Navy involvement, whilst the moth (of the species Melese laodamia) depicts the unique role of the Squadron (this particular moth avoids predatory bats by jamming their prey-finding "radar" system). 360 Squadron moved again in September 1975 to RAF Wyton where it remained until being disbanded in October 1994, its work being taken over by Flight Refuelling Ltd.

In 1991 360 Squadron achieved 25 years of service, and was presented with a Squadron Standard. No. 360 Squadron had many unique aspects: its role, its number had not been previously issued, and it is the only squadron to have been formed, awarded a Standard, and disbanded during Queen Elizabeth II's reign.

National Association Football League teamsTozer is a surname commonly believed to have originated in Devon, South West England. It is a reference to the occupation of carding of wool which was originally performed by the use of teasels (Latin carduus), via the Middle English word tōsen, to tease [out]. The surname has variants, including the lesser-known "Tozier".

The Tozers of Moretonhampstead
According to the Moretonhampstead History Society, the Tozer family was, by 1332, established at Howton, which was part of the manor of Moreton until it was alienated. A 15th-century record in the Public Record Office (C.1/56/207) records a legal dispute between John and William Tozer over "Houghton in the parish of Moreton".

The Baytown Nature Center is located in Baytown, Texas,  east of Houston. It is located on a  peninsula along the Houston Ship Channel and surrounded on three sides by Burnet Bay, Crystal Bay, and Scott Bay.

The Baytown Nature Center is both a recreation area and a wildlife sanctuary that is home to hundreds of bird species, mammals, reptiles, and aquatic species. The City of Baytown created this Nature Center in 1994. The SWA Group's Houston office provided land planning and landscape architectural services.

History 

The Baytown Nature Center was, for many years, a highly desirable residential neighborhood known as Brownwood with nearly 400 substantial homes on a  peninsula.

In 1961, Hurricane Carla devastated the Texas Gulf Coast, flooding most of Brownwood and ending any new development in the area. Afterwards, subsidence became a serious problem as industrial and municipal water users along the Houston Ship Channel and in the general Houston area pumped out groundwater faster than natural forces could replenish the aquifer(s). Thus, during the 1970s and 1980s, much of the Texas Gulf Coast (including most of Brownwood) sank a total of 10 to . Brownwood, which had previously been high and dry, was repeatedly inundated by high tides and storms.

In 1983, extensive damage from Hurricane Alicia finally led to the abandonment of most of Brownwood's homes. The City of Baytown started buying out the properties of neighborhood residents. In 1984, the City prepared its first master plan to transform these properties into a public park and wildlife sanctuary.

By 1990, the steadily encroaching waters had submerged many Brownwood streets. In 1991, Baytown's voters approved $300,000 in bonds for the Brownwood Marsh Restoration Project. Although the bonds were sold in 1994, the $300,000 was hardly enough to meet the master plan's $1.4 million budget.

The short-fall was made up by the French Limited Task Group, a Superfund consortium of 200 companies, headed by ARCO Chemical Company. A United States District Court had ordered the Task Group to carry out a marsh restoration project to replace natural resources that were damaged or destroyed by members’ illegal dumping activities.

The City of Baytown carried out the phased restoration project. Crouch Environmental Services, a Houston-based environmental consulting firm which specializes in wetlands design and construction, was the prime consultant and contractor. The Houston office of The SWA Group—an international land planning, landscape architecture, and urban design firm based in Sausalito, California—provided land planning and landscape architectural services.

Planning and development 

In 1994, the Brownwood Marsh Restoration Project's master plan, which had been prepared by Crouch Environmental Services and The SWA Group, was approved by a Project Review Group consisting of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Texas General Land Office.

In late 1994, work on the  Brownwood Marsh Restoration Project began. First, work crews sealed the inlets into nearby Scott Bay so that they could temporarily pump the water out of the property. Then, workers removed the remaining roads, houses, and utilities from the site. Afterwards, they graded the property and dug three -wide channels through the property. Once work was complete, these channels were used to re-flood the site and provide good crosscurrent flows to encourage natural restoration activity and feed the returning wetlands wildlife. The channels also provided the necessary tidal exchange (with its nutrient-rich, oxygenated waters) to help create important “edge” habitats for crustaceans, fish, and birds.

In their grading operations, the crews also transformed two elevated areas, which included hundreds of mature trees, into islands and created four new small freshwater ponds. These freshwater ponds and the planting of cabbage palmettos, live oaks, as well as beneficial bottomland shrubs and trees like red maple and green ash, were designed to lure a wide variety of migrant and indigenous birds, reptiles, and small mammals to the site.

For the Baytown Nature Center's watery edges and its inland areas, Crouch Environmental Services and The SWA Group selected flora with high value for wildlife, like nesting areas and food. They also specified plant species like Smooth cordgrass, Sedge, Wiregrass, and live oaks that already thrived in this coastal area.

As early as Fall 1995, with just one phase of construction largely completed, deer, fish, crustaceans, and 275 bird species had already appeared in the new wetlands, including two endangered species: the Osprey, a fish-eating hawk, and the three-foot-tall wood stork.

The Baytown Nature Center today 

Today, the Baytown Nature Center has two peninsulas. Absolutely all dogs/pets are banned - even those remaining within their  owners vehicle. The smaller of the two peninsulas—San Jacinto Point—is designated as a recreation area. In addition to large oak trees and grass lawns, San Jacinto Point has three fishing piers, an observation platform, a Children's Nature Discovery Area playground, picnic tables, benches, and a concrete walkway along the bay shoreline.

The much larger peninsula—known as the Natural Area—has two islands with mixed woodlands, a saltwater marsh, freshwater marsh, several ponds, as well as mixed woodlands and tall grass habitats for birds, mammals, and other wildlife. The Crystal Bay Butterfly Garden near the entrance is planted with native plants and wildflowers that attract butterflies and hummingbirds.

The Brownwood Education Pavilion—a covered shelter atop a -high hill surrounded by wetlands—has panoramic views of the Natural Area's wetlands and the three surrounding bays. Five nature trails of varying lengths loop through the peninsula. The Natural Area's observation blinds and platforms overlook the ponds. They, along with wood duck boxes and trails, are far enough away from the islands and nesting areas to avoid disturbing the burgeoning wildlife, yet close enough for Baytown residents and visitors to observe nature's beauty and diversity.

Currently home to 317 species of resident and neo-tropical migratory birds, the Baytown Nature Center is part of the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail, a  trail of bird watching sites from Beaumont to Brownsville.

Operated by the City of Baytown and open to the public (for a fee), the Baytown Nature Center has also become an important nursery area for a variety of aquatic species, including shrimp, crab, and various fish.

Heat shock factor protein 4 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HSF4 gene.

Heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs) activate heat-shock response genes under conditions of heat or other stresses. HSF4 lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic repeat which is shared among all vertebrate HSFs and has been suggested to be involved in the negative regulation of DNA binding activity. Two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding distinct isoforms and possessing different transcriptional activity have been described.
Olfactory receptor 6X1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the OR6X1 gene.

Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.
Acme Attractions was a London clothing store on Kings Road, Chelsea, London, that in the early 1970s provided a place for many punk and reggae musicians and scenesters to hang out. Shop assistant and manager Don Letts described Acme Attraction as a place "where the interaction between the different factions became more important than selling merchandise, even though at that age it was a deadly combination."

History
Acme Attractions was inspired by Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's Fifties-inspired boutique Let it Rock (revamped in 1972 and renamed Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die). In spring 1974, a radical change saw their shop become Sex, selling fetish wear and Westwood's innovative designs. Acme's owner, John Krivine, decided to venture into clothing with Steph Raynor. In 1974, Acme Attractions initially opened as a stall in the antiques market Antiquarius on the King's Road, Chelsea. While it was owned by Krivine and Raynor its public face was Don Letts who says that Acme was selling "electric-blue zoot suits and jukeboxes, and pumping dub reggae all day long". Acme actually had to move to the basement after complaints about Don Letts's pounding dub reggae.

Within two weeks of opening there were queues to get in. Steph Raynor remembers:

By the mid 70s, Acme had quite a scene attracting the likes of The Clash, the Sex Pistols, Chrissie Hynde, Patti Smith, Deborah Harry and Bob Marley. Letts remembers that "Marley ... come by because he knew he could get a good draw from the thriving black-market action that also went on in Acme." The scene created by the shop also led to the formation of Generation X, which launched the pop music career of Billy Idol.

Andrew Czezowski 
The Acme accountant, Andrew Czezowski, seeing the potential in the crowd the store attracted, started up The Roxy, the first punk-rock venue in London, so that people could go from the store and have some place to party. Letts was the first house DJ. Czezowski attended the 100 Club Punk Special in September 1976. He managed Generation X and The Damned and later founded The Fridge nightclub at 390 Brixton Rd in 1981.

Chelsea
Chelsea, a band, formed in August 1976 and were originally managed by John Krivine and Steph Raynor, and was in direct competition with Malcolm McLaren's SEX and Sex Pistols.

Boy London
Seeing the success of punk and how a new market was created for punk related clothing and merchandise, Stephane Raynor and Israel-based businessman John Krivine closed Acme Attractions to create Boy London, at 153 King's Road, in 1976.

Vivienne Westwood licensed designs to Boy, who issued them, some with alterations, over the next eight years. Krivine sold the company in 1984.

While Don Letts  opened the new store, he soon quit, "It was the bastard child of Acme, created to capitalize on the "tabloid punk" and although I opened and ran the joint it just weren't my speed. I quit to manage the Slits and headed off on the White Riot tour with The Clash."
Hamlet 2  is a 2008 American comedy film directed by Andrew Fleming, written by Fleming and Pam Brady, and starring Steve Coogan, Catherine Keener, Amy Poehler, and David Arquette. It was produced by Eric Eisner, Leonid Rozhetskin, and Aaron Ryder. Hamlet 2 was filmed primarily at a New Mexico high school from September to October 2007. The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was distributed by Focus Features.

Plot
Dana Marschz is a recovering alcoholic and failed actor who has become a high school drama teacher in Tucson, Arizona, "where dreams go to die". Despite considering himself an inspirational figure, he only has two enthusiastic students, Rand Posin and Epiphany Sellars, and a history of producing poorly received school plays that are essentially stage adaptations of popular Hollywood films (his latest being Erin Brockovich). When the new term begins, a new intake of students are forced to transfer into his class as it is the only remaining arts elective available due to budget cutbacks; they are generally unenthusiastic and unconvinced by Dana's pretensions, and Dana comes into conflict with Octavio, one of the new students.

Dana is floored when Principal Rocker notifies him that the drama program is to be shut down at the end of the term. Seeking to inspire his students, Dana undertakes to write and produce an original play: a sequel to Hamlet featuring time travel to avoid the deaths of the characters, and new, more controversial content, including the introduction of Jesus Christ as one of the characters, complete with a song-and-dance number titled "Rock Me Sexy Jesus". The kids gradually warm to the project, but Rand – cast as a bi-curious Laertes and overshadowed by Octavio as Hamlet – storms out of the drama group and provides a copy of the play's script to Principal Rocker, who orders Dana to stop the controversial production.

Dana is further traumatized when his wife Brie leaves him for the uninteresting, but fertile, boarder Gary they had taken into their home to supplement their modest income, and reveals that he himself is infertile. Despondent, Dana falls off the wagon and tries to abandon the project, but his students encourage him to continue, arranging an abandoned warehouse and rave spot, technical assistance, and security being provided by the high school's football and wrestling teams. Dana also learns that the cancellation of the play has become a civil liberties issue encouraged by fanatical ACLU activist Cricket Feldstein. As a result, the play opens to a sold-out house, including a critic from The New York Times. Rand returns to the group, apologizing for his desertion; Dana allows him to return to the role of Laertes.

The play itself initially meets with a mixed reception, due to its controversial content and mangling of the original play; in keeping with a running joke throughout the movie, much of the content revolves around the characters using time travel to mend their troubled relationships with their fathers; it ends with both Hamlet and Jesus forgiving their fathers for the wrongs done to them. Although initially reluctant to engage with the play, with several protesters infiltrating the audience to stage a direct protest, the play gradually wins the audience over. Dana and his favorite actress, Elisabeth Shue – whom he is now dating – meet Dana's students to prepare for the show's Broadway opening, complete with original cast.

Production
The play shown within the film was written on deadline for production. The film was budgeted at a little over $9 million. Production began in September 2007 in New Mexico.

Filming took place mainly at West Mesa High School in Albuquerque, where actual students were permitted to perform as extras in the film. Filming concluded on October 31, 2007. The film was executive produced by Albert Berger and Ron Yerxa, who also produced Little Miss Sunshine.

Release
A rough edit of Hamlet 2 was prepared for the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it was a late addition, three days prior to its scheduled screening. The film premiered at the festival on January 21, 2008. After the screening, an all-night bidding war took place for rights to distribution, which Focus Features won for $10 million, acquiring worldwide rights to the film. The purchase of Hamlet 2 nearly broke the Sundance record set by Little Miss Sunshine, which sold for $10.5 million in 2006.  In wide release, the film grossed roughly half of the rights cost.

The film had a limited release on August 22, 2008, followed by a wide release on August 27. Its UK release was originally scheduled for December 28, 2008, postponed until February 27, 2009, and eventually cancelled.

Home media
The DVD was released December 21, 2008. The DVD includes deleted scenes, an audio commentary, and a sing-along.

The film was also released as part of a four movie, "teen-comedy" collection from Universal in 2011.

Critical response
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 62%, based on 145 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, "The script's biting premise and Steve Coogan's endearing, off-the-handle performance make Hamlet 2 a hysterical -- if slightly painful -- ride." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling the film "an ideal showcase for the talents of Coogan." The New York Times states that the film "made sure to take shots at Christians, gays, Latinos, Jews, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Elisabeth Shue, one of its lead actresses."

Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter described Hamlet 2 as "a slam-bang patchwork of more inspired comedies, such as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Borat." Byrge described the premise as "a twist on the formula of let's-put-on-a-show, with the twist being that no one wants the show." He thought that the screenwriters had put together "a string of gags in a hit-and-miss dither."

Population
The average treatment effect (ATE) is a measure used to compare treatments (or interventions) in randomized experiments, evaluation of policy interventions, and medical trials. The ATE measures the difference in mean (average) outcomes between units assigned to the treatment and units assigned to the control.  In a randomized trial (i.e., an experimental study), the average treatment effect can be estimated from a sample using a comparison in mean outcomes for treated and untreated units. However, the ATE is generally understood as a causal parameter (i.e., an estimate or property of a population) that a researcher desires to know, defined without reference to the study design or estimation procedure. Both observational studies and experimental study designs with random assignment may enable one to estimate an ATE in a variety of ways.

General definition 

Originating from early statistical analysis in the fields of agriculture and medicine, the term "treatment" is now applied, more generally, to other fields of natural and social science, especially psychology, political science, and economics such as, for example, the evaluation of the impact of public policies. The nature of a treatment or outcome is relatively unimportant in the estimation of the ATE—that is to say, calculation of the ATE requires that a treatment be applied to some units and not others, but the nature of that treatment (e.g., a pharmaceutical, an incentive payment, a political advertisement) is irrelevant to the definition and estimation of the ATE.

The expression "treatment effect" refers to the causal effect of a given treatment or intervention (for example, the administering of a drug) on an outcome variable of interest (for example, the health of the patient). In the Neyman-Rubin "potential outcomes framework" of causality a treatment effect is defined for each individual unit in terms of two "potential outcomes." Each unit has one outcome that would manifest if the unit were exposed to the treatment and another outcome that would manifest if the unit were exposed to the control. The "treatment effect" is the difference between these two potential outcomes. However, this individual-level treatment effect is unobservable because individual units can only receive the treatment or the control, but not both. Random assignment to treatment ensures that units assigned to the treatment and units assigned to the control are identical (over a large number of iterations of the experiment). Indeed, units in both groups have identical distributions of covariates and potential outcomes. Thus the average outcome among the treatment units serves as a counterfactual for the average outcome among the control units. The differences between these two averages is the ATE, which is an estimate of the central tendency of the distribution of unobservable individual-level treatment effects. If a sample is randomly constituted from a population, the sample ATE (abbreviated SATE) is also an estimate of the population ATE (abbreviated PATE).

While an experiment ensures, in expectation, that potential outcomes (and all covariates) are equivalently distributed in the treatment and control groups, this is not the case in an observational study. In an observational study, units are not assigned to treatment and control randomly, so their assignment to treatment may depend on unobserved or unobservable factors. Observed factors can be statistically controlled (e.g., through regression or matching), but any estimate of the ATE could be confounded by unobservable factors that influenced which units received the treatment versus the control.

Formal definition 

In order to define formally the ATE, we define two potential outcomes :  is the value of the outcome variable for individual  if they are not treated,  is the value of the outcome variable for individual  if they are treated. For example,   is the health status of the individual if they are not administered the drug under study and  is the health status if they are administered the drug.

The treatment effect for individual  is given by . In the general case, there is no reason to expect this effect to be constant across individuals. The average treatment effect is given by

and can be estimated (if a law of large numbers holds)

where the summation occurs over all  individuals in the population.

If we could observe, for each individual,  and  among a large representative sample of the population, we could estimate the ATE simply by taking the average value of  across the sample. However, we can not observe both  and  for each individual since an individual cannot be both treated and not treated. For example, in the drug example, we can only observe   for individuals who have received the drug and  for those who did not receive it. This is the main problem faced by scientists in the evaluation of treatment effects and has triggered a large body of estimation techniques.

Estimation 

Depending on the data and its underlying circumstances, many methods can be used to estimate the ATE. The most common ones are:
 Natural experiments
 Difference in differences
Regression discontinuity designs
 Propensity score matching
 Instrumental variables estimation

An example 
Consider an example where all units are unemployed individuals, and some experience a policy intervention (the treatment group), while others do not (the control group). The causal effect of interest is the impact a job search monitoring policy (the treatment) has on the length of an unemployment spell: On average, how much shorter would one's unemployment be if they experienced the intervention? The ATE, in this case, is the difference in expected values (means) of the treatment and control groups' length of unemployment.

A positive ATE, in this example, would suggest that the job policy increased the length of unemployment. A negative ATE would suggest that the job policy decreased the length of unemployment. An ATE estimate equal to zero would suggest that there was no advantage or disadvantage to providing the treatment in terms of the length of unemployment. Determining whether an ATE estimate is distinguishable from zero (either positively or negatively) requires statistical inference.

Because the ATE is an estimate of the average effect of the treatment, a positive or negative ATE does not indicate that any particular individual would benefit or be harmed by the treatment. Thus the average treatment effect neglects the distribution of the treatment effect. Some parts of the population might be worse off with the treatment even if the mean effect is positive.

Heterogenous treatment effects 

Some researchers call a treatment effect "heterogenous" if it affects different individuals differently (heterogeneously).  For example, perhaps the above treatment of a job search monitoring policy affected men and women differently, or people who live in different states differently. ATE requires a strong assumption known as the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) which requires the value of the potential outcome  be unaffected by the mechanism used to assign the treatment and the treatment exposure of all other individuals. Let  be the treatment, the treatment effect for individual  is given by . The SUTVA assumption allows us to declare .

One way to look for heterogeneous treatment effects is to divide the study data into subgroups (e.g., men and women, or by state), and see if the average treatment effects are different by subgroup. If the average treatment effects are different, SUTVA is violated. A per-subgroup ATE is called a "conditional average treatment effect" (CATE), i.e. the ATE conditioned on membership in the subgroup. CATE can be used as an estimate if SUTVA does not hold.

A challenge with this approach is that each subgroup may have substantially less data than the study as a whole, so if the study has been powered to detect the main effects without subgroup analysis, there may not be enough data to properly judge the effects on subgroups.

There is some work on detecting heterogenous treatment effects using random forests. Recently, metalearning approaches have been developed that use arbitrary regression frameworks as base learners to infer the CATE. Representation learning can be used to further improve the performance of these methods.

An intracolonic explosion or colonic gas explosion is an explosion inside the colon of a person due to ignition of explosive gases such as methane. This can happen during colonic exploration, as a result of the electrical nature of a colonoscope.

A colonic gas explosion is rare; however, the result can be acute colonic perforation, which can be fatal.

Cause 
An explosion is triggered by a combination of combustible gases such as hydrogen or methane, combustive gas such as oxygen, and heat.

Prevention 
Careful bowel preparation, such as cleansing the colon before a procedure, is key to preventing an intracolonic explosion.

He was born in 1881 in Bonn. His father was the surgeon Otto Wilhelm Madelung. He earned a doctorate in 1905 from the University of Göttingen, specializing in crystal structure, and eventually became a professor. It was during this time he developed the Madelung constant, which characterizes the net electrostatic effects of all ions in a crystal lattice, and is used to determine the energy of one ion.

In 1921 he succeeded Max Born as the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the Goethe University Frankfurt, which he held until his retirement in 1949. He specialized in atomic physics and quantum mechanics, and it was during this time he developed the Madelung equations, an alternative form of the Schrödinger equation.

He is also known for the Madelung rule, which states that atomic orbitals are filled in order of increasing  quantum numbers.

Charles Franklin Reaugh (December 29, 1860 – May 6, 1945), known as Frank Reaugh, was an American artist, photographer, inventor, patron of the arts, and teacher, who was called the "Dean of Texas Painters". Born and raised in Illinois, he moved as a youth with his family to Texas. There he developed an art career devoted to portraying Texas Longhorns, and the animals and landscapes of the vast regions of the Great Plains and the American Southwest. He worked in both pastels and oil paints and was a prolific artist, producing more than 7,000 known works. He was active in the Society of Western Artists.

Early years
Reaugh was born in 1860 near Jacksonville, the seat of Morgan County in west central Illinois, to George Washington Reaugh, who had worked as a miner in the California gold rush, and the former Clarinda Morton Spilman. Reaugh (pronounced RAY), moved with his parents and family in 1876 to Terrell in Kaufman County east of Dallas. The original family name was "Castelreaugh", but his Irish immigrant ancestors had shortened it to "Reaugh" when they entered the United States. The Reaughs initially made their living in Terrell by cultivating cotton, still a major commodity crop in East Texas. Reaugh was inspired by these drives: riding horseback next to a huge herd of cattle, seeing wild birds and animals, and traveling through a wide variety of landscapes.

Art education and career
During the winter of 1884–1885, Reaugh studied at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1888 he sailed to France, where for the next year he studied at the Académie Julian in Paris. Here he became interested in pastels at The Louvre museum.

Prolific painter

In total, Reaugh created more than seven thousand works. He concentrated on small plein air pastel sketches of the iconic Texas Longhorn, a subject he found challenging to portray. He once said that "no animal on earth has the beauty of the Texas steer."

His best-known paintings include:
Watering the Herd (1889)
The O Roundup (1894)Grazing the Herd (1897)The Approaching Herd (1902)Twenty-Four Hours with the Herd (seven paintings, after 1930)Texas Cattle (April 1933, his last major work)

Inventor
Reaugh created his own art materials and tools. He also patented a rotary pump for commercial use. He served on the board of directors for the Limacon Pump Company in Dallas.

Art instructor

Reaugh established an art school in Dallas in 1897. For many years, Reaugh led groups of art students on sketching expeditions throughout West Texas, ranging into New Mexico and Arizona.  His colleagues Charles Peter Bock and Louis Oscar Griffith sometimes accompanied him on these trips.

Many of his students, including Reveau Bassett, Florence McClung, Harry Carnohan, Lucretia Donnell, John Douglass, Olin H. Travis, Edward G. Eisenlohr, Lloyd Goff, Alexandre Hogue, and Josephine Oliver, gained regional and national prominence.  Several of these became part of the group known as the Dallas Nine.

In 1900, the Dallas Morning News employed Reaugh as a weekly art commentator and reporter. He taught briefly at Baylor University, and gave illustrated lectures in the art department of Texas Christian University.

Reaugh helped found the Dallas Art Society (which later developed as the Dallas Museum of Art), The Frank Reaugh Art Club, and the Striginian Club. Frank Reaugh also championed the creation of the Dallas Museum of Art in the early twentieth century.

Legacy

Several of his paintings are displayed at the Texas State Capitol in Austin. Many of his other works are held by the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum at West Texas A&M University in Canyon. Fellow painter Harold Dow Bugbee, a former curator of the museum, is also featured there. Other Reaugh works are at the Southwest Collection/Special Library Collection at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

Having given away most of his possessions, Reaugh died in poverty in Dallas in 1945 at the age of eighty-four. He is buried in Terrell Cemetery.

In 2007, the exhibition The Pastel Range: Frank Reaugh, Ranch Historian was shown at the National Ranching Heritage Center in Lubbock, Texas. In 2015, the Harry Ranson Center in Austin, Texas, staged the retrospective exhibit "Frank Reaugh: Landscapes of Texas and the American West"  and published the related book, Windows on the West: The Art of Frank Reaugh.

Ainsi on a assassiné tous les Mossé
The English translation of the book's title is So they murdered all Mossi people. It was first edited in 1979 by Naaman Editions (Canada) and re-edited in 1994 by Edition Fondation Pacere.

This essay describes the "anti-history" principle, one of the main ones guiding the design of Mossi people's society and the destruction of their civilization along with colonization.

Simply stated, anti-history consists of acknowledging that human societies' goal is to make people live happily. When a society can use acquired resources to perpetuate a steady state of fulfillment, it must stop trying to get more (because that would result in disequilibrium) and perpetuate the means and forces that maintain that society in that steady state. Then, the society will have to work against changes and against time to maintain the equilibrium over generations: That is the origin of the term "anti-history".

Anti-history and equilibrium are the very core principles of the Mossi civilization which as said in Ainsi on a assassiné tous les Mossé no longer effectively exists.

Track listing 
Cystatin-S is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CST4 gene.

The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and the kininogens. The type 2 cystatin proteins are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors found in a variety of human fluids and secretions. The cystatin locus on chromosome 20 contains the majority of the type 2 cystatin genes and pseudogenes. This gene is located in the cystatin locus and encodes a type 2 salivary cysteine peptidase inhibitor. The protein is an S-type cystatin, based on its high level of expression in saliva, tears and seminal plasma. The specific role in these fluids is unclear but antibacterial and antiviral activity is present, consistent with a protective function.

While there are many castles in South Yorkshire, the majority  are manor houses and motte-and-bailey which were commonly found in England after the Norman Conquest.

Mediaeval castles

Beighton
Beighton is now a suburb of Sheffield, but in the mediaeval period lay just over the county boundary in Derbyshire.  Its castle is known only from a single thirteenth century reference to "the tower of the former castle", and its location is not known with certainty.  However, the Enclosure Plan for the village and a plan made in 1792 indicate a site by the River Rother, which may have formed a moat.

Bradfield

Bradfield lies north west of Sheffield.  Two sites in the village have been identified with castles.  Bailey Hill is a  motte, and an eighteenth-century excavation found stonework, suggesting that its castle may have been rebuilt in stone.  Its bailey covered three-quarters of an acre, and its surrounding ditch and rampart still stand up to  high.  The village grew up around this castle, which was dependent on Sheffield Castle.  The site is a scheduled monument.

Nearby Castle Hill has been variously identified as a ringwork, a natural look-out point, or a siege work. The hill, which could possibly be a motte, has been quarried, although one source suggests remains of a keep were visible in 1819.

Conisbrough

Conisbrough Castle dates from the twelfth-century castle.  Its remains are dominated by the  high circular keep, which is supported by six buttresses. In the mid-1990s, the keep was restored, with a wooden roof and two floors being rebuilt. The building is considered one of South Yorkshire's primary tourist attractions, and sees in excess of 35,000 visitors per year.

Doncaster
Doncaster Castle lay on the site of the town's Roman fort, beside the River Don.  It stood on a motte, which lies under the east end of St George's Minster.  The motte was surrounded by a  deep ditch,  wide, which later marked the bounds of St George's churchyard.  The castle was demolished, probably in the twelfth century, and there are no visible remains.

Hickleton
Hickleton lies west of Doncaster.  Its castle was a motte and bailey, known from a seventeenth-century sketch of the motte made by Roger Dodsworth.  The site was subsequently destroyed by quarrying, and no remains are visible.

Kimberworth
Kimberworth lies west of Rotherham.  Its wooden castle was a motte and bailey, dependent on Tickhill Castle.  The motte survives, but there is no visible evidence of the bailey, and the castle was never rebuilt in stone.  The site is a scheduled monument.

Laughton
Laughton-en-le-Morthen lies south east of Rotherham.  Laughton Castle was a motte and bailey dependent on Tickhill Castle, and was probably built on the site of a hall owned by Edwin, Earl of Mercia.  The motte survives, as does a ditch surrounding the bailey.  The castle was probably originally built by Roger de Busli, and may predate his castle at Tickhill.  The site is a scheduled monument.

Langthwaite

Langthwaite lay north of Doncaster.  The village is now abandoned, but the site of the castle lies near Adwick-le-Street.  The castle was a motte and bailey.  The motte survives, reduced in height, while a  wide ditch marks the outline of the bailey.  The site is a scheduled monument.

Mexborough
Mexborough lies north of Rotherham.  Its wooden castle was a motte and bailey, dependent on Tickhill Castle.  The motte and earthworks of the bailey survive in a public park (Castle Hills Park) and so are freely accessible during daylight hours.  The castle was never rebuilt in stone.  Although reduced in size, the motte stands  high, and is surrounded by a six-foot bank and a  wide ditch.  The site is a scheduled monument.

Sheffield

The first Sheffield Castle was a wooden motte and bailey type, built for William de Lovetot in the early twelfth century. The first castle was destroyed during the Second Barons' War in 1266, along with the rest of the town, and was replaced by a larger stone castle in 1270.  The castle was badly damaged in the English Civil War and largely demolished in 1648.

Skellow
Skellow lies north west of Doncaster.  Its castle was a motte and bailey.  The motte survives in the grounds of Skellow Hall, and part of the earthworks of the bailey can be seen in a field to the north.  The site was reused during the English Civil War, and is now known as Cromwell's Batteries.  The site is a scheduled monument.

Tickhill

Tickhill Castle was a prominent stronghold in the reign of King John I of England.

Thorne

Thorne lies north east of Doncaster.  Its castle was a motte and bailey dependent on Conisbrough.  The motte survives, now known as Peel Hill.  A ditch around the motte also survives, and a few wall fragments have been found.  The castle may have also acted as a hunting lodge for Hatfield Chase.  The tower, built of masonry, survived at least until the fifteenth century, when John Leland wrote that "by the church garth of Thorne is a praty pile or castelet, well diked, now used for a prison for offenders in the forestes".  The foundations were largely removed in the 1820s.  The site is now a scheduled monument.

Other sites
There is a Castle Hill in Hampole, but the site has been heavily ploughed, and no evidence of a castle survives. There was a fortified manor house at Bolsterstone ("Bolsterstone Castle") of which only remnants remain.  Fenwick has a mediaeval moat, and this site has been identified as the possible location of a fortification noted in 1272.  Darfield New Hall was the site of a tower house built around the fifteenth century, sometimes identified as a pele tower.  Cusworth Park in Sprotborough has a "Castle Hill", sometimes identified as a motte, but this may be a landscape gardening feature.

Manor Houses

Aston Hall

Brierley Hallsteads

Denaby Old Hall

Houndhill
Houndhill in Worsbrough, Barnsley. The house has two sides of mediaeval fortification walls remaining along with two of the original four turrets.  The fortified manor house was defended by fifty men-at arms during the English Civil War.  The house still remains in the hands of the Elmhirst family who owned it at the time of the civil war.

Manor Lodge

Radcliffe Moat

Other sites
Bentley has a double moat, with foundations of a building visible on the central platform.  This may have been a mediaeval manor house.  Rossington similarly has the Draw Dykes Moat, which was probably the site of a manor house, although there could conceivably have been a castle there.  Hooton Pagnell Hall is a Tudor building, likely built on the site of a manor house.  Cowley Manor in Ecclesfield was demolished in the seventeenth century, but is believed to have been a moated manor house.

Murrays' Mills is a complex of former cotton mills on land between Jersey Street and the Rochdale Canal in the district of Ancoats, Manchester, England. The mills were built for brothers Adam and George Murray.

The first mill on the site, Old Mill, was begun in 1797, and is the world's oldest surviving urban steam-powered cotton spinning factory. After Old Mill opened, the company continued to expand and prosper, and by 1806 the complex was the largest in the world, employing about 1,000 people at its peak: Decker Mill was opened in 1802, New Mill in 1804, Little Mill in 1822, and Doubling and Fireproof Mill in 1842. The main complex formed a quadrangle surrounding a private canal basin linked under the road to the Rochdale Canal, which opened in 1804. The canal basin was used to deliver raw cotton and coal and to transport spun cotton away from the complex.

In 1898, A & G Murray became part of the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association Limited (FCSDA). The mill complex began to decline in the early 20th century as the canal basin was filled in and Little Mill burnt down. The mill was replaced with the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use mains electricity. The mill complex continued producing cotton until the 1950s. The mills were later leased out to other companies and in some cases allowed to fall into disrepair. Between 2000 and 2003, Urban Splash redeveloped Fireproof and Doubling Mill into offices, winning a RIBA Award. The rest of the complex underwent a £17M regeneration between 2004 and 2006 and are proposed to be used as flats and a hotel.

History

Foundation and establishment

After migrating from Scotland in the 1780s, the Murrays established themselves as manufacturers of textile machinery before moving into spinning fine yarn. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the main market for Murrays' fine spun yarn was the muslin-weaving industry in Scotland; along with McConnel & Kennedy, A & G Murray dominated the Scottish market. In 1790, Adam Murray leased land in Ancoats; in partnership with his brother George, began construction of his first mill – which was complete by about 1798. The mill was probably designed to house equipment produced by the Murray brothers themselves. First known as Union Mill, from its position on Union Street, the Old Mill was a purpose-built steam-powered spinning mill. Construction took approximately a year and millwright Thomas Lowe – who had worked on Richard Arkwright's first two factories – planned the building. It is eight storeys high and probably the first cotton-spinning factory to have been built that high. The first phase of the mill, an area of  by , was built of 400,000 locally made bricks. The machinery was powered by a 12 horse power (hp), £620 Boulton and Watt steam engine.

Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, had begun by 1801 to the east of Old Mill. It was the same height as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex. Decker Mill was completed in time to exploit the economic boom in the cotton trade that followed the brief peace in the war with France from 1802–1803. During its construction, the steam engine was replaced a more powerful 40 hp Boulton and Watt engine.

After the completion of the Ancoats section of the Rochdale Canal in 1804, raw materials no longer had to be moved by cart. Coal and cotton could be moved directly into the complex and there was a readily available supply of water for the steam engines from the private basin on the canal. The entrance tunnel to the basin was set 90° to the canal, with a short arm on the opposite side; and as the canal is only  wide, it posed navigation problems for canal boats, which could be  in length. It is possible that cargo was transferred to smaller vessels for the journey between the canal and the complex basin.

Construction of New Mill was probably completed in 1804. It measured  by  and as with the older mills, it was eight storeys high. It was fitted with a 45 hp steam engines from Boulton and Watt. All three mills were steam-power cotton-spinning factories.

The complex was further extended with the addition of two four-storey blocks on Murray Street and Bengal Street by 1806.  These were mainly used  as warehouses and offices.  An entrance archway in the Murray Street block provided the only access to a central courtyard where the mills had their entrances. This meant that access to all parts of the site could be controlled.

By 1806, the Murrays' Mills was the largest mill complex in Manchester and the world.  With 84,000 mule spindles the complex was huge compared to others at the time, most of which had less than 10,000 spindles. The status of the complex was reflected in the amount of ornamentation on the Murray Street and Bengal Street blocks compared to other mills.  The Murray Street block had a symmetrical arrangement of arched doorways and windows.  This pattern was in turn mirrored on the Bengal Street block, which had an arrangement of false doorways.

A & G Murray prospered during the early 19th century, and in 1809 the firm was valued at £20,456: 13% more than their nearest rival, McConnel & Kennedy, and more than double the firm in third place. The company was "one of the largest cotton-spinning firms in Manchester, and probably the country". By 1815, it employed 1,215 people.

Expansion

During the early to mid-19th century there were several periods of depression and prosperity in the cotton trade. In this period, A & G Murray would have been less affected by these changes due to the size of the firm. In 1817, engineers William Fairbairn and his partner James Lillie updated the complex.  The contract, Fairbairn's first as a millwright, involved the replacement of line shafting in the complex, with wrought iron line-shafting designed to work at higher speeds. Adam Murray died in 1818 and his brother George continued to run the firm. By 1818, the firm had nearly tripled in value since 1809 to £59,000.

Additionally, the firm also expanded beyond Bengal Street further along the strip of land between Jersey Street and the Rochdale Canal.  Little Mill was built on the corner of Jersey Street and Bengal Street around 1822. It was originally six storeys high, but an additional three storeys were added at an unknown later date. The building covered  and just over half of this area would have been occupied by a gasometer house which would have supplied the complex with gas used for lighting. The mill was linked to New Mill via a tunnel which may have carried the gas supply. Engineer Joshua Field visited the mill in 1821 and commented "they spin the finest thread". He also noted that the furnace which provided steam to drive the engines had been fitted with a "smoke burner" to "lessen the consumption of fuel", also having the effect of reducing the amount of smoke produced.

Despite the continued expansion, by 1824 competitors McConnel and Kennedy had overtaken the Murrays as Manchester's biggest cotton spinners.  In 1833 A & G Murray were employing only 841 people, a reduction in workforce George Murray attributed to "recent improvement in the firm's machinery".

In 1842, Doubling Mill and Fireproof Mill were built on the corner of Redhill Street and Bengal Street. Doubling Mill is five storeys high with an engine house designed to contain a 40 hp beam engine. Doubling Mill was used for doubling – the process of combining two or more lengths of yarn into a single thread – cotton produced in the company's earlier mills, giving the mill its name. Fireproof Mill, again as its name suggests, was designed to be fireproof by using cast-iron beams and columns rather than timber; it was the first mill in the mill complex to have been built to resist fire. The mill is four storeys high and may have been used as a warehouse. The two new mills were also linked to the original complex by tunnels under Bengal Street. The firm "doubled more or less" in size during the early to mid nineteenth century and expanded into the fine yarn markets around Nottingham, the growth of the firm led to the creation of the Doubling and Fireproof Mills.

In December 1852, the mill complex was valued at £75,000; when George Murray died in 1855, two of his three sons – James and Benjamin – inherited the complex. By 1881, A & G Murray had become registered as a limited liability company and the running of it was mostly in the hands of manager Herbert Dixon, who had joined the company in 1876, as the Murray family played less of a role. Under Dixon the company modernised and used new technology and was the reason for the firm's continued success. The use of new, more efficient technologies resulted in the further reduction of the workforce so that by 1897, A & G Murray only employed 500 people. In 1887, Fireproof Mill and Doubling Mill were leased by A & G Murray Ltd to C E Bennet.

In September 1898, A & G Murray was "voluntarily wound up and conveyed to the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association Limited (FCSDA)".  The association had been an idea on the part of Dixon and Scott Lings to form an association of cotton spinners.  Thirty-one other cotton spinners also joined the association.  The association had the advantage of great size in comparison to the competition, and had the necessary clout to secure raw materials.  With Dixon as its Managing Director until 1917, by the 1920s, the FCSDA was the largest and most successful cotton-spinning association in the world with over 60 mills and 30,000 employees.

On 28 January 1908, a fire broke out in Little Mill, caused by some machinery. The fire lasted for about 12 hours and caused an estimated £20,000 damage and resulted in 200 employees at the mill losing their jobs. Whilst fighting the fire a fireman was killed when a fire-tender blew over in high winds. The building was replaced by a new building, New Little Mill, five storeys high, four shorter than its predecessor but occupying a larger area of ground. The new mill had concrete floors and was designed to use mains electricity. The building is the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use mains electricity.

Decline and later use
An 1891 Ordnance Survey map shows that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had been filled in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as a reservoir, suggesting that the canal had ceased to be used as a way of transporting goods to and from the complex. By 1902, the canal basin had been filled in, however exactly when it was filled in is unknown.

Between 1902 and 1903, Old and Decker Mills were reduced in height by 1 storey to 7 storeys and New Mill was reduced in height by 2 storeys to 6 storeys.  The exact reason for this reduction is unknown, however, it is speculated that the structure of the buildings was struggling to cope with the weight of increasingly heavy machinery.  This theory is given added weight by the fact that at around the same time the timber beams used to support ceilings were replaced with steel beams to strengthen the building.  In 1930 the Bengal Street block was also reduced in height by 2 storeys and buttresses were constructed against the south wall of Decker Mill.

By the 1940s Fireproof Mill and Doubling Mill were occupied by a bedding manufacturer.  In 1948, the break-up of the main site began with Old Mill and Decker Mill being sold, with the Murray Street block following in 1950, and the Bengal Street block in 1960. Old and Decker Mill were used as a warehouse after 1954 and later used by several clothing manufacturers.

Although some work was done to strengthen the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy what remained of the site.

Redevelopment
In 2000, Total Architecture appointed Urban Splash to convert Fireproof and Doubling Mill  into office space.  On completion in 2003, the conversion received a RIBA Award.

The North West Development Agency used a compulsory purchase order to take control of the main site in 2003. This allowed the Heritage Lottery Fund to give a £7.164M grant towards the restoration of the complex. Together with an additional grant from the North West Development Agency, a £10M regeneration project took place between 2004 and 2006. The project included repair and strengthening of the structure, the restoration of the canal basin, a new roof and windows, and the reinstatement of two missing floors from the Murray Street block.

On completion of the repairs, there have been further proposals to bring the complex back into use by converting it into flats and a hotel. The conversion, including the replacement of the demolished Bengal Street block, was expected to start in 2007 or 2008 and take three years.  However, in July 2008 it emerged that due to the current state of the housing market, developer Inpartnership wanted to amend planning consent for the development, replacing plans for flats in Old and Decker Mills with office space.

Manchester Life Development Corporation – a joint venture between Manchester City Council and Abu Dhabi Group - took over the site in 2013. They employed Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios to renovate the existing historic buildings with the aim of turning ‘the first industrial neighbourhood in the world’ into a lively residential neighbourhood.

Wing Mill, which had been destroyed by fire in the 1990s was replaced by a new-build block, and the historic mill buildings were converted into 123 apartments and a townhouse in the former engine house building, set around a courtyard garden.

Working conditions
Like many factories of the nineteenth century, the complex was not without criticism for its working conditions.  Although George Murray would not reveal working hours in the complex, it is likely that up until 1825 the workers had a similar work requirement as the 72-hour week demanded of workers at the neighbouring McConnel Kennedy complex.  After 1825, the Cotton Mills, etc. Act 1825 reduced this to 69 hours – 12 hours per day on Monday to Friday and 9 hours on a Saturday.  These hours were worked by all but the youngest employees.

The workers were allowed three breaks per day.  In order to stop employees wandering off and taking breaks that they were not entitled to, tunnels were built under the road between the main complex and the later mills on the other side of Bengal Street.

The worst conditions in the mill were experienced by those at the bottom end of the pay-scale.  The first stage of unpacking the raw cotton and cleaning out impurities, which was carried out by unskilled workers,  produced large amounts of dust that was both a health hazard and serious fire risk.  A visitor to the complex in 1832 described the dust as "almost suffocating".

On the spinning floors, the spinning process required a warm humid environment.  George Murray stated that they tried to keep temperatures at around 24 °C (75 °F).  Spinners were regarded as craftsmen, and they were paid by the amount they produced.  They were also left to recruit, train and pay their own assistants.  These assistants were often children, and consisted of "piecers" who rejoined broken threads and mule scavengers who cleaned the machinery.  Child labour was generally considered by mill managers to be an important way of securing a skilled adult work force.

Compared to other trades, wages in cotton mills were relatively high.  In 1833, the average earnings of an employee at the complex was 12 shillings (60p) per week, which compared favourably with other mills.  However, unlike some other mill owners the Murrays did not give employees credit to buy goods from company-owned stores, or provide housing for employees beyond key workers.

Despite all this, evidence suggests that conditions were better than in some other mills.  The complex had opening windows, and an extra room per floor for workers to wash.  The third break of the day, in the afternoon, was also a luxury that many workers in other mills did not receive. Furthermore, the Murrays also claimed that, unlike many other mill owners, they did not use pauper children from workhouses, or knowingly employ children under the age of nine, although George Murray conceded that some parents did employ their own children below that age.

The United States House of Representatives elections in California, 1932 was an election for California's delegation to the United States House of Representatives, which occurred as part of the general election of the House of Representatives on November 8, 1932. This election began the transition of California from a solidly Republican state to a swing state, which it would be for the next 60 years. California gained nine seats as a result of the 1930 Census; it would have been six if the House seats were reapportioned in 1920 since California would have had 14 seats as a result of the 1920 Census. Democrats won six of those seats while Republicans won three. Of California's existing seats, Democrats won four Republican-held seats.

There's No Place Like A Home is a comedy play by Paul Elliott which tells the story of the residents of Stollberg Hall Retirement Home for Theatrical Performers. When the home is threatened with closure, they do what any self-respecting bunch of former entertainers would do; they devise a cunning plan to save the home from closure, which is so theatrical and entertaining only they could pull it off.

These older retired residents decide to kidnap a celebrity and hold them to ransom, using the money from this to save the grand house (and its even grander residents) and they choose Jeffrey Archer as their victim, only for things to go very wrong.

The play toured in autumn 2006 and autumn 2007, with Gorden Kaye, Ken Morley, Don Maclean, Christopher Beeny, Peter Byrne, Brian Cant, Sue Hodge, Jan Hunt, Jody Crosier, Mike Edmonds, Brian Godfrey, and Emily Trebicki.

Reviews appear to have been mostly unenthusiastic to lukewarm; but the Daily Telegraph was positive.
The George Wyth Memorial State Park is a state park of Iowa in the United States. The park was dedicated in 1940 as "Josh Higgins Parkway", named for a popular radio character of the day. In 1956, it was renamed George Wyth Memorial State Park after a well-known Cedar Falls businessman and conservationist.

The park is located near Waterloo and Cedar Falls. Its large expanse of woodland is abundant with many varieties of wildlife. Bird-watchers have observed more than 200 different species and white-tailed deer can be seen year-round. The park has been designated as a National Urban Wildlife Sanctuary.

Camping
The campground has 69 camping units with modern showers, rest rooms and a trailer dump station. Advance campsite reservations can be booked through the park reservation system. Half of the campsites are available for self-registration on a first-come, first-served basis, while the remainder require reservations.

Trails
George Wyth has  of paved multi-purpose trails created for biking, in-line skating and walking. These trails are linked to a  trail network within the cities of Waterloo and Cedar Falls. George Wyth also has  of grass hiking trails. In winter, sports such as cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling are also popular.

The Lake-to-Lake State Park Bike Route is a  route connecting Pine Lake and George Wyth Memorial State Parks. This route primarily utilizes county highways, and established bike routes and paths once inside Cedar Falls/Waterloo.

Lake
The park is unique in that it has several water areas: Brinker Lake (120 acres, open for power boating), George Wyth Lake (75 acres, no wake lake with handicap accessible fishing pier and fishing jetties), Fisher Lake (40 acre natural lake), Alice Wyth Lake (60 acres, electric motors only) and the Cedar River. Sailboating and windsurfing are also popular. George Wyth beach is a popular swimming spot in the community. The lakes and river provides anglers a variety of fish. Boat ramps are available on the river and lakes.
Charles Platt (born 26 April 1945 in London, England) is a British author, journalist and computer programmer. He relocated from England to the United States during 1970 and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has one child, Rose Fox, who edits science-fiction, fantasy, and horror book reviews. Platt is the nephew of Robert Platt, Baron Platt of Grindleford.

Fiction
Platt's novel The Silicon Man has been endorsed by William Gibson as "A plausible, well-crafted narrative exploring cyberspace in a wholly new and very refreshing way".

As a fiction writer, Charles Platt has also used pseudonyms: Aston Cantwell (1983), Robert Clarke (Less Than Human, a science-fiction comedy of 1986) and Charlotte Prentiss (historical and prehistory novels, between 1981 and 1999). He contributed to the series of Playboy Press erotic novels with the house pseudonym Blakely St. James that was shared by many other writers during the 1970s.

Platt is also known for writing the novel The Gas during 1970 for the Ophelia Press (OPH-216), an imprint of publisher Maurice Girodias's Olympia Press. (Girodias also published several of Barry N. Malzberg's early novels.) When Platt's novel was published in the United Kingdom by Savoy Books during 1980, copies were seized by the UK's Director of Public Prosecutions.

Platt wrote a variety of science-fiction novels, including Garbage World, Protektor, and Free Zone, and two books in Piers Anthony's Chthon universe, titled Plasm and Soma. He ceased writing science fiction after 1990.

Nonfiction
From 1980 to 1982, Platt interviewed about forty major science-fiction writers such as Andre Norton, Philip K. Dick, J. G. Ballard, Frank Herbert, Isaac Asimov, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr, Ray Bradbury, John Brunner. These interviews were the basis for two books of profiles, Dream Makers (1980) and Dream Makers II (1983). They were nominated for Hugo Awards, and received a Locus Award.

Platt began writing for Wired magazine in its third issue, and ultimately became one of its senior writers, contributing more than thirty full-length features. He was an early user of the internet service provider MindVox and wrote five books on computers and computer programming during that period. His nonfiction has appeared in publications such as Omni, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times.

While covering the 1994 Hackers on Planet Earth Conference for his article "Hackers: Threat or Menace?" in Issue 2.11 of Wired Magazine, Mr. Platt annoyed attendees by his interjections during the panel discussion entitled "What is this Cryptography Stuff and Why Should I Care?" Mr. Platt repeatedly inquired loudly "Where's the crime?", an exclamation later adopted as a nickname for him by some hackers. The conference organizer, Eric Corley (aka Emmanuel Goldstein) penned a rebuttal to Platt's article and commentary on his methods that was published partially  in the "Rants and Raves" section of Wired, Issue 3.02.

Platt's book Make:Electronics was published in December, 2009 by O'Reilly Media. An introductory-level hands-on tutorial, it is available in conjunction with kits of components from Maker Shed. Make:More Electronics (a sequel) and volumes 1, 2, and 3 of Encyclopedia of Electronic Components have since been published, followed by Make: Tools, a basic tutorial in the use of hand tools. All of Platt's books sharing the Make: logo are illustrated with his own drawings and photographs.

Computer programming
Platt acquired an early desktop computer, an Ohio Scientific C4P, and learned to write game programs for it which were distributed as shareware. Subsequently, he wrote educational software published by Trillium Press, and participated in the first conference on cellular automata at MIT, where he demonstrated MS-DOS-based software that he composed and sold by mail order. His program to generate the Mandelbrot Set was also self-published and sold primary to university mathematical departments. He is the author of six computer books, from the satirical Micro-Mania to the instructional Graphics Guide to the Commodore 64. For many years he taught computer graphics classes in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop at The New School for Social Research in New York City.

Editing and publishing 
Platt joined Michael Moorcock's New Worlds (magazine) team as de facto art director and graphic designer from 1967 to 1970. Although not trained as a graphic designer, he was largely responsible for the collage-like appearance of much of the magazine at the time.

During 1970 Charles Platt became a consulting editor for Avon Books company, acquiring work for their science-fiction list. Subsequently, he performed a similar role for the short-lived paperback trade-name Condor Publishing, and was science-fiction editor for Franklin Watts, Inc.

During the 1980s Platt self-published The Patchin Review, a magazine of literary criticism and commentary emphasizing science fiction. Although each issue sold only 1,000 copies, the venture acquired notoriety for its edgy attitude and attracted contributions from many then-well-known science fiction editors and authors, including Philip K. Dick, Gregory Benford, Brian W. Aldiss, David Hartwell, and others.

During 2007 Platt became a section editor for Make (magazine), for which he had already been a frequent contributor. In 2011 he became a contributing editor to the magazine, and retains that title currently.

Cryonics 
Platt became interested in cryonics during 1990 after visiting the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. He wrote a book on the subject, Life Unlimited, for which a contract was issued by Wired Books; the publisher ceased doing business, and the text remains unpublished. Platt became President of CryoCare Foundation, which he co-initiated during 1993. He was Director of Suspension Services for Alcor, a company which may be best known for cryopreserving Ted Williams's head and body after he died. During 2004 Platt became a director and General Manager of Suspended Animation, Inc., based in Boynton Beach, Florida. Suspended Animation pursues R&D to develop equipment and procedures for use in mitigating ischemic injury immediately after cardiac arrest in terminal patients who have made arrangements for cryopreservation. Platt resigned his jobs with the company at the end of 2006. He continued to design and build prototypes of rapid cooling equipment for the company until 2010, and coauthored a pending patent (application number 20110040359, dated February 2011). His final work on a device that could cool patients after cardiac arrest, with potential applications in conventional medicine, was completed for a California laboratory in 2011. It employs a breathable perfluorocarbon liquid and uses the lungs as a heat exchanger in a process known as partial liquid ventilation (see liquid breathing).

Fréterive is a commune in the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France.
Kuthu is a 2004 Indian Tamil-language masala film directed by A. Venkatesh, starring Silambarasan, Ramya and Kalabhavan Mani. It is a remake of the 2003 Telugu film Dil. The music was composed by Srikanth Deva.

Released on 14 April 2004, it received mixed reviews and was an average hit. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Dheerudu. Ramya was credited in later Tamil films as Divya Spandana because she disliked the name "Kuthu Ramya" that resulted from the success of this film.

Synopsis
Gurumoorthy "Guru" is a sociable boy from a middle-class family. He lives with his parents- a doting mother and a strict but well-meaning father- and playful maternal uncle. He enrolls at the College of Arts and Sciences, and falls in love with  Anjali, a fellow student, who doesn't reciprocate his affections.

Anjali's father is the rich and powerful gangster Veerabahu, who is extremely protective of his daughter to the point that he brutally beats up a boy at a temple for brushing past her by accident. A misunderstanding results in Guru being beaten up by Veerabahu's men, who suspect that he and Anjali are lovers. After this, he vows to win Anjali's love for real. In due course, she falls in love with him too. How the lovers stand strong in the face of Veerabahu's increasingly desperate attempts to separate them forms the rest of the story.

Roswitha Krause (born 3 November 1949) is a retired German freestyle swimmer and team handball player. She is the first woman to win Summer Olympic medals in two different sports. Krause won a silver medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico in the 4×100 m freestyle relay.

Biography
She then focused on handball and won a silver and a bronze medal with East German teams at the 1976 and 1980 Olympics, respectively, as well as two world titles in 1975 and 1978 and three European Cups. Meanwhile, she continued winning national titles in swimming through late 1970s.

She took up swimming because her doctor advised it to improve her shoulder condition; however, she noted in 1970 that her heart was always for ball sports, handball or football. In 1970 she started training in handball and for about a year did both swimming and handball every week. After that she focused on handball and by 1973 was part of the national team. She retired after the 1980 Olympics to coach handball and swimming at the Humboldt University.
Perceptual Evaluation of Video Quality (PEVQ) is an end-to-end (E2E) measurement algorithm to score the picture quality of a video presentation by means of a 5-point mean opinion score (MOS). It is, therefore, a video quality model. PEVQ was benchmarked by the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) in the course of the Multimedia Test Phase 2007–2008. Based on the performance results, in which the accuracy of PEVQ was tested against ratings obtained by human viewers, PEVQ became part of the new International Standard.

Application 
The measurement algorithm can be applied to analyze visible artifacts caused by a digital video encoding/decoding (or transcoding) process, radio- or IP-based transmission networks and end-user devices. Application scenarios address next generation networking and mobile services and include IPTV (Standard-definition television and HDTV), streaming video, Mobile TV, video telephony, video conferencing and video messaging.  

The measurement paradigm is to assess degradations of a decoded video sequence output from the network (for example as received by a TV set top box) in comparison to the original reference picture (broadcast from the studio). Consequently, the setup is referred to as end-to-end (E2E) quality testing.

Algorithm 
The development for picture quality analysis algorithms available today started with still image models which were later enhanced to also cover motion pictures. PEVQ is full-reference algorithm (see the classification of models in video quality) and analyzes the picture pixel-by-pixel after a temporal alignment (also referred to as 'temporal registration') of corresponding frames of reference and test signal. PEVQ MOS results range from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent) and indicate the perceived quality of the decoded sequence.

PEVQ is based on modeling the behavior of the human visual system. In addition to an overall MOS score, PEVQ quantifies abnormalities in the video signal by a variety of KPIs, including PSNR, distortion indicators and lip-sync delay.
Richard D'Aeth (3 June 1912 – 19 February 2008) was a British educationalist and President of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, from 1978 to 1984.

Early life
D'Aeth was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the son of Walter D'Aeth and Marion Turnbull. He was educated at Bedford School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. At Emmanuel, he was a scholar and took a first class Honours degree in Natural Science before completing his PhD.

Career
D'Aeth's first job was as a schoolmaster at Gresham's School in Norfolk, from 1938 to 1940, after which he served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. In 1946 he was appointed one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools. In 1952 he took up an appointment as the Professor of Education at the University College of the West Indies and in 1958 returned to the United Kingdom as the first full Professor of Education at the young Exeter University, where he remained until a merger with St Luke's College in 1978 created a new School of Education. He was then appointed as President of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, where he remained for six years. He was also a Commonwealth Fellow at Harvard University and retired to Stoke Gabriel, near Totnes, Devon in 1984.

Publications
D'Aeth's most significant publication was his Education and Development in the Third World (Farnborough, UK: Saxon House Press; Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books, 1975).
"Exterminate!" is a song by German Eurodance group Snap! featuring American singer Niki Haris. It was released in December 1992, as the third single from their second studio album, The Madman's Return (1992), and features vocals by the group's new front woman, Haris. It is based on the track "Ex-Terminator" and was included in later editions of the album. Released first at the end of 1992, it was a hit in several countries, peaking at number-one in Finland and Spain, and number two in the United Kingdom, where it spent 15 weeks on the charts.

A popular version of the song, came from a duet recorded by F. Michael Sky and Farmer Murray in 2003. Critics acclaimed the track as it climbed to the top five songs in Switzerland.

Chart performance
"Exterminate!" went on becoming very successful on the charts in Europe, peaking at number-one in Finland and Spain. It entered the top 5 also in Belgium (3), Denmark (5), Germany (3), Greece (2), Ireland (2), Italy (3), the Netherlands (4), Switzerland (2) and the United Kingdom, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it reached number two. In the UK, the song also peaked at number two in its second week at the UK Singles Chart, on January 10, 1993. It was held off reaching the top spot by Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" and stayed at number two for three weeks. Additionally, "Exterminate!" reached the top 10 also in Austria (9), Norway (9) and Portugal (10). Outside Europe, it went to number two on the RPM Dance/Urban chart in Canada, number six in Zimbabwe, number 25 in New Zealand, number 29 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in the US and number 50 in Australia. 

In Germany, the single was awarded with a gold record after 250,000 units were sold.

Critical reception
Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "Former Madonna backing singer steps into the spotlight as the German act's new (at least for the moment) front woman. Electronic hip hop beats are doused with ambient sound effects, while Haris offers an appropriately ominous and forceful vocal. Not as radio-friendly as the previous "Rhythm Is a Dancer", but a savvy club entry that should glide onto playlists." In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton said, "Its chart success so far is somewhat of a surprise being, aside from the one vocal line, almost an instrumental and certainly with little of the quirky appeal of the earlier singles." Sharon O'Connell from Melody Maker felt it's "full of latent power but just sitting on the launch pad."

Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote that it "might not be as accessible on first hearing, but it's actually a killer dance song which chokes you with its chorus with built-in snappy piano riff." A reviewer from Music Week stated, "The trance-like tune builds and builds from a five note riff, while new vocalist Niki Harris manages to fill in some soulful wailing as well as the Dalek's catchphrase. The song hasn't got the same killer pop chorus as "Rhythm Is a Dancer", but its sheer simplicity will win the day." Barbara Ellen from NME commented, "After what seemed like an interminable long and shaky period post "The Power", Snap seem to have rediscovered their dancing feet recently, first with "Rhythm Is a Dancer" and now this upfront, arrestingly sterile disco diversion." Mark Sutherland from Smash Hits gave the song three out of five in his review.

Music video
The accompanying music video for "Exterminate!" was directed by Angel, who had previously directed the video for "Colour of Love". This was the first video that Durron Butler (Turbo B) does not appear. It received heavy rotation on MTV Europe and was later published on Snap!'s official YouTube channel in 2011. As of December 2022, the video had generated more than 1.5 million views.

Population
Janus Stark, or The Incredible Adventures of Janus Stark, is a British comic strip series, originally written by Tom Tully and drawn by Francisco Solano López. It is about an escapologist in Victorian London who appears to be simply an unusual act on the music hall stage, but who privately uses his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. The strip debuted on 15 March 1969 in Smash! and ran in that title until 1971, when it moved to Valiant, running for another four years until 1975.

The character was later revived in France, running in his own title until the mid-1980s.

Publication history
Solano López was a foreign illustrator, born in Argentina, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK. The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of Smash! into Valiant in 1971, running in that title from 10 April 1971 to 22 March 1975. With the move, the scripts were taken over by Angus Allan with art by the studio of Solano López.

The Incredible Adventures of Janus Stark was reprinted and translated into French in his own title, published by Mon Journal, beginning in 1973. When the publication ran out of reprint material, they created new adventures, lasting until issue #89 (May 1986).

Fictional character biography
The protagonist was born in 1840 as the orphan Jonas Clarke. His background story explains that he was sent to an orphanage where he was mistreated, but escaped and lived in the streets. There he befriended a beggar, Blind Largo, who taught him pickpocketing, but also trained Clarke's unique gift for body bending and escaping. Stark has an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations at need.

As an adult, Clarke takes on another persona as Janus Stark and becomes an escapologist and private detective.

Later appearance 
Janus Stark appears in the six-issue limited series Albion (2005) by Alan Moore, Leah Moore, John Reppion, Shane Oakley, and George Freeman. In this "new" two-page adventure, he is imprisoned, along with at least Spring-heeled Jack and Joseph Merrick (the Elephant Man), by an Inspector Bryant, simply for being thought by the Victorian government to be "dangerous individuals." Stark succeeds in breaking them all out of prison.

In popular culture
The British punk band Janus Stark based its name on this comic strip.

On the Series K, episode 5 of QI, Alan Davies sparks a tangent discussion about a superhero he remembers from "Valiant Comics" called Janus, who he describes as an "escapologist who can get through tiny gaps". Davis noted that every week Janus seemed to be in a situation where the solution was for him to get through a tiny gap.

The Carabinetta Automatica O.V.P was a submachine gun developed in Italy.

Development 
At the end of 1916, Major Bethel-Abiel Revelli - designer of the Villar Perosa - demonstrated a new weapon to the Department of Air Artillery which was called the Carabinetta Automatica O.V.P.. The weapon was an attempt to adapt the Villar Perosa into a single-barreled, shoulder-fired carbine, on the request of the Aviation Corps who wanted a replacement for the Mauser C96 as a personal defence weapon for aviators.

The OVP was little more than the barrel and action of the VP attached to a wooden buttstock and provided with a trigger and some small refinements.

Although formally classed as a delayed blowback, the delay is minimal and certainly had little practical effect as seen by the high rate of fire. The mechanism is the usual one of bolt and return spring, but the bolt is controlled by a track in the receiver body that causes the bolt to rotate 45 degrees as it closes. The striker carries a lug bearing on the receiver track that also bears on a cam face on the bolt, so that the firing pin, driven by the return spring, cannot go forward to fire the cartridge until the bolt has rotated. When the gun is fired, recoil of the cartridge case moves the bolt back, causing it to rotate to the unlocked position, during which movement the pin is withdrawn by the action of the bolt's cam surface. Once unlocked the bolt is free to recoil and complete the firing cycle.

An unusual feature of the OVP that was not on the original VP gun was the use of a cylindrical sleeve surrounding the receiver for cocking the weapon. This was grasped and pulled to the rear to retract the bolt and then pushed forward during firing. Another oddity, this time carried over from the VP, was the provision of a slot in the rear edge of the top mounted magazine that allowed the firer to see how many rounds remained inside it. However, this also allowed dust and dirt to enter the magazine.

The O.V.P. submachine gun was trialed again in February of 1917 and patented in March. The patent sketch depicts a few design features that would not be present in the production model, including the placement of the magazine feed on the underside of the receiver, and centrally-mounted iron sights which would be replaced in the final model with offset, left-mounted sights. It is possible that this  magazine arrangement was abandoned because the Villar Perosa magazines performed better with gravity assistance. It is not known whether the prototype tested in 1916 and early 1917 was built with the unusual features seen on the patent sketch, but in any case the final production model was not.

History 
Requirement for a weapon of this type was decided by the Aviation Corps upon experiencing difficulty requisitioning Mauser C96 pistols. Due to the war  the Italian government could not place further orders  from the Mauser factory. Purchases of C96 copies from other countries, including China, managed to ward off the adoption of the O.V.P until May 1918, when it officially came into service as the C96's replacement. Its adoption was also approved by the Naval Aviation Corps. Some 500 submachine guns (recorded as Carabine .V.P.) were delivered to the Aviation Corps in 1918. It is generally believed that these were the only such guns ever produced. These guns were distributed to pilots and observers in the last year of the war; a known user of the O.V.P. submachine gun was the famous aviator Antonio Locatelli.

Contrary to popular belief, the O.V.P. submachine gun was not issued to, infantry assault units. The army held their own separate submachine gun trials which compared designs by Beretta, Ansaldo, SIAI Savoia, Cei-Rigotti, and A.N. The Beretta gun was adopted,  in September 1918 as the Moschetto Automatico Revelli-Beretta Mod. 1915 (commonly known as the "Beretta Model 1918") - however it was ultimately only adopted in semi-automatic form.

After the war, the immediate requirement for the O.V.P. submachine gun disappeared and production likely ceased. O.V.P. split with Fiat in 1919 and suspended armaments manufacture. A small number of O.V.P. submachine guns remained in Italian service, however by the 1930s, it was considered obsolete and it appears that quantities of this gun were sold as surplus to Haile Selassie's army. The Italians later invaded the country in 1935 and may have captured some O.V.P. guns from the Ethiopians. It was used in small numbers by some Italian units in the Western Desert in 1941, but generall the weapon was   phased out by the superior Beretta  38.
Indrehovdeholmen is an island lying  west of Langhovde-kita Point in the eastern part of Lützow-Holm Bay, Antarctica. It was mapped by Norwegian cartographers from air photos taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition, 1936–37, and named "Indrehovdeholmen" (the inner knoll island) because of its position among the islands adjacent to the Langhovde Hills.
The Dark Backward (also known as The Man with Three Arms) is a 1991 American satirical comedy film written and directed by Adam Rifkin, and starring Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, and Lara Flynn Boyle. The film features special makeup effects by Alterian, Inc.

Plot summary
Marty Malt (Judd Nelson) is an unhappy garbage man who moonlights as an atrociously unfunny standup comic. He lives in a dark, grimy, garbage-strewn urban netherworld, where a company named Blump's apparently owns everything. His best friend and fellow trash collector, Gus (Bill Paxton), is the only one who laughs at his jokes, and his sincerity is questionable. The obnoxiously exuberant Gus plays an accordion, which he always carries with him. Marty is seeing Rosarita (Lara Flynn Boyle), a waitress, but she doesn't seem too interested in him.

One day, Gus convinces a talent agent, Jackie Chrome (Wayne Newton), to check out Marty's act. Jackie isn't impressed. Marty's luck seems to take a turn for the worse when a large lump starts growing on his back. He goes to a quack doctor (James Caan), who calls him a wimp and puts a Band-Aid on the lump. The lump continues to grow, eventually becoming a full-sized arm. While Gus uses Marty's newfound freakishness to impress his morbidly obese girlfriends, a horrified Rosarita breaks up with Marty, and he gets fired from the club where he does his act.

Marty is despondent until Gus brings him to see Jackie, who, it turns out, has always dreamed of finding a real three-armed comic. Re-christened "Desi the Three-Armed Wonder Comic," and with Gus now providing musical accompaniment, Marty gets a fresh start on his career. Marty and Gus have a few semi-successful shows and eventually meet Hollywood talent agent Dirk Delta (Rob Lowe), who offers them a job. Marty, Gus and Jackie celebrate this big break and everything seems to be looking up until Marty wakes up the following morning and discovers his third arm has inexplicably vanished.

He goes with Gus to see Jackie, who is furious at first but calms down and decides to tell Dirk the truth upon Marty's suggestion. After calling Dirk and telling him the bad news, Dirk surprisingly asks them to send Gus to fill the spot with his accordion playing. Gus is ecstatic and leaves almost immediately. Marty is sad but gets his job back at the club and uses the story of his third arm in his act and finally gets a few laughs from the crowd.

Reception

Box office
The Dark Backward performed extremely poorly during its limited run, making only $28,654.

Critical response
The film received mostly negative reviews upon its release. It received a 45% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews (five positive, six negative). Janet Maslin of the New York Times criticized the film's silly story, poor acting and grotesque scenes, calling the film a confused David Lynch wanna-be that "concentrates only on stomach-turning trivia and on the kind of exaggeratedly stupid behavior that amounts to directorial condescension" and "the film's efforts to say something about success and its capriciousness never succeed in rising above an elbow-in-the-ribs obviousness." Scott Weinberg of eFilmCritic.com gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 saying it "tries way too hard to be a cult classic, which probably explains why it's not one."

Not all reviews were negative. Brian Webster of the Apollo Guide enjoyed the film, giving it a score of 74/100 and describing it as "Odd and twisted, The Dark Backward has plenty to thrill admirers of ugliness and enough food for thought to interest the rest of us too."

4708 Polydoros  is a Jupiter trojan from the Trojan camp, approximately  in diameter. It was discovered on 11 September 1988, by American astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker at the Palomar Observatory in California. The D-type asteroid belongs to the 80 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 7.5 hours. It was named after the Trojan prince Polydorus, from Greek mythology.

Orbit and classification 

Polydoros is a Jovian asteroid located in the  Lagrangian point, 60° behind on Jupiter's orbit in the so-called Trojan camp . It is also a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.6 AU once every 12 years and 1 month (4,403 days; semi-major axis of 5.26 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar in September 1988.

Physical characteristics 

In the SDSS-based taxonomy, Polydoros is a dark D-type asteroid. It has also been characterized as a D-type by Pan-STARRS' survey. Its V–I color index of 0.96 is typical for most larger D-type Jupiter trojans (see table below).

Rotation period 

In August 2011, a rotational lightcurve of Polydoros was obtained from photometric observations by Linda French at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Lightcurve analysis, however, gave an incorrect rotation period of  hours with a brightness variation of 0.25 magnitude.

Several subsequent observations during 2014–2018 by Daniel Coley and Robert D. Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies achieved a good period determination, with the best-rated one from November 2015, which gave a period of  hours and an amplitude of 0.17 magnitude.

Diameter and albedo 

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Polydoros measures 54.96 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.064, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057, and calculates a diameter of 55.67 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.0.

Naming 

This minor planet was named by the discoverer from Greek mythology after the Trojan prince Polydorus, the youngest and swiftest of King Priam's many sons. Although forbidden by his father, Polydoros confronted Achilles anyway, and was killed by him beside the River Scamander, near his brother Lycaon . The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 April 1991.

History 
The first section of the route was opened between Carlisle and Scotch Dyke on 12 October 1861, to Newcastleton on 1 March 1862, Riccarton Junction on 2 June 1862 and throughout on 24 June 1862.  The railway was built as a double-track main line throughout.

Connections to other lines 
 Edinburgh and Hawick Railway at 
 Border Counties Railway at 
 Caledonian Railway Main Line at Gretna
 Maryport and Carlisle Railway, Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, Midland Railway Settle and Carlisle Line and Lancaster and Carlisle Railway at Carlisle Citadel

Current operations 
The line was closed to all traffic by British Railways on 5 January 1969. The line was dismantled in 1971.

The Waverley Route Heritage Association have preserved a part of the former route at Whitrope and are working on reopening the section from its base at Whitrope itself down into Riccarton Junction as a heritage railway.

Mikhail Nikolayevich Vasilyev (1770 – June 23, 1847) was a Russian explorer and vice admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy. He is reputed for having surveyed the then little-known coast of Alaska as navigator. Vasiliev was sent by the Russian Imperial Hydrographic Service in 1819 to explore the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean and particularly the area around the Bering Strait. Certain geographic features of the Alaskan coast, like the Lindenberg Peninsula and Sealion Island were named by him in the maps that were subsequently published.

In 1820 Mikhail Vasiliev on the ship Otkrytie (Discovery) entered the Chukchi Sea and explored the coast of Alaska from Kotzebue Sound to Icy Cape and later from Norton Sound to Cape Newenham. He was accompanied by Gleb Semenovich Shishmarev (1781-1835), who was in command of the ship Blagonamerennyi (Good Intent). After these surveys, in which he is credited to be the first European having sighted Nunivak Island, Vasiliev sailed to Petropavlovsk and returned to Kronstadt, arriving there on August 2, 1822.

Vasiliev's name is spelt "Vasilief" in the United States, where Vasilief Bay in Atka and Cape Vasilyev in Nunivak Island were named after him by Captain Fyodor Petrovich Litke; Cape Vasilyev was later renamed "Cape Corwin" by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names in 1909. There are other geographic features in the coast of Alaska and the Aleutians bearing the name "Vasilief", but it is not clear after which Vasiliev they were named.

The Mucker is a novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs.  It was originally formed by two stories: "The Mucker", begun in August 1913 and published by All-Story Weekly in October and November 1914; and "The Return of the Mucker", begun in January 1916 and published by All-Story Weekly in June and July 1916.  The book version was first published by A. C. McClurg on 31 October 1921.  From January 1922 to August 1939, Methuen (UK) published a version of The Return of the Mucker under the title The Man Without a Soul.

In 1917, Burroughs wrote a third Mucker story entitled The Oakdale Affair featuring the Return of the Mucker sidekick, Bridge. The story was serialized the next year.  In 2008, Leonaur Ltd. published all three stories in the Mucker "trilogy" in a collected volume entitled The Complete Mucker.

Plot summary
Billy Byrne is a low class American born in Chicago's ghetto. He grows up a thief and a mugger. "Billy was a mucker, a hoodlum, a gangster, a thug, a tough." He is not chivalrous nor kind, and has only meager ethics - never giving evidence against a friend or leaving someone behind. He chooses a life of robbery and violence, disrespecting those who work for a living. He has a deep hatred for wealthy society.

He trains as a prizefighter but cannot stop drinking. When falsely accused of murder, he flees to San Francisco and is shanghaied aboard a ship. Enforced sobriety, brutal ship's discipline and productive work improves him. The ship's secret mission is soon enacted - the hijacking of a specific yacht to take a millionaire's daughter, Barbara Harding, for ransom. Billy Byrne brutally beats her suitor, Billy Mallory, leaving him for dead.

"He knew that she looked down upon him as an inferior being.  She was of the class that addressed those in his walk of life as 'my man.'" After Barbara confronts him and calls him a coward, a change begins in Billy Byrne. He saves the life of one kidnapper, Theriere, rather than letting him be washed overboard, though he cannot fathom his own reasons. After a terrible storm, the ship is damaged and only makes it to land with Billy's help at the wheel. He rescues Barbara from the wreck and brings her ashore. Barbara is kidnapped by headhunters descended from medieval Japanese. Byrne and Theriere race to rescue her from the daimyo's hut in the middle of the village, but Theriere is fatally wounded in the escape.

Billy protects Barbara from the jungle for weeks while his own wounds heal. After realizing he's in love with her, he agrees to let her teach him how to speak properly. When he is again wounded while rescuing two of her father's ships officers from savages, she confesses her love for him also. Learning that Mallory is still alive, and being held by the headhunters along with her father, Billy sets off to free them. During their escape, Billy is severely injured. Certain he is mortally wounded, he sends Mr. Harding and Mallory to care for Barbara. However, the next day finds him clinging to life, and he slowly retraces his steps to where he left Barbara. Believing him dead, they have all left. Months later, he is picked up by a ship.

Upon returning to the States, Billy gets a job as a fighter. As he reads about his victory in the papers, he spots a small notice that Barbara's engagement to Mallory has been broken. Coincidentally, Barbara sees the news about Billy's fight, and sends for him. As he enters her father's posh home, he realizes that he can never fit in there. He explains that the gulf between them cannot be bridged, and that she and Mallory must marry.

Sequel: "The Return of the Mucker"
[[File:All story weekly 19160617.jpg|thumb|"The Return of the Mucker" was published in All-Story Weekly" in 1916.]]
Billy returns to his old Chicago haunts intending to clear his name. His time with Barbara imbued him with faith in the law and justice. However, he soon realizes that the system is more interested in finding someone guilty than in finding the guilty party. Awaiting the verdict, he reads that Barbara and Mallory are about to marry. He is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Disillusioned, he jumps from the train carrying him to the state prison. He falls in with Bridge, a poetic gentleman tramp who refuses to turn him in after finding out he's on the lam. He and Bridge head south, pursued by a detective. To avoid capture, Billy determines to cross to Mexico, and Bridge elects to come along.

Mexico is torn by internal warfare, and they are quickly captured by a bandit general, Pesita. He hires Billy into his private army, but Bridge has to seek work at a nearby American ranch. The ranch is owned by Mr. Harding, who has foolishly brought his daughter Barbara to this unstable country, at her insistence, to escape questions about her cancelled marriage.

In the meantime, Billy is sent to case a garrisoned town to plan for Pesita's force to storm and rob the bank. Billy finds the layout trivial and stealthily robs it himself. Coincidentally, Bridge has been sent to the same town to collect the payroll from the bank. Bridge notices a figure on horseback as Billy leaves town. Bridge gives chase to the unknown horseman, and the two exchange fire before recognizing each other. Billy's horse is killed, so Bridge insists he take his ranch horse, Brazos, and escape before the garrison catches him.

Back at the American ranch, some hands spot a large American riding Brazos during a raid by Pesita. The foreman demands that Bridge explain, but he cannot without betraying Billy. All assume Bridge robbed the bank, and the foreman plans to turn him over to general Villa, who will hang him. Barbara helps him escape, but he is later captured. Barbara pays a shady native, Jose, to take a message to the unknown large American, asking him to aid the imprisoned Bridge.

Billy rescues Bridge from jail and they ride back to Pesita's headquarters. When Billy learns that Brazos belongs to an unnamed girl Bridge admires, he decided to return the horse regardless of his own safety. An errand for Pesita stops him at Jose's house, where he is captured by the American foreman and some of Villa's men. Knowing he robbed the bank, they secure him for the night at the ranch. Barbara comes to talk to the unknown American, and discovers Billy. She helps him to escape, and immediately afterward she is kidnapped.

Billy learns about the kidnapping and races back to the ranch. He and the American hands ride out to search for her. The Mexican hands decide to go into town, leaving only Mr. Harding and three servants. Pesita learns that the American ranch is ripe for a raid. Bridge overhears this, takes off to the ranch and organizes its pitiful defences.

Billy tracks Barbara to a native village and rescues her. They return to the ranch in time to save Bridge and Mr. Harding, and they all ride for the US. At the border military compound, Billy tells Barbara he won't give her up again, and they plan to leave the country. Billy runs into the detective who had chased him, and finds out the guilty man has confessed and Billy himself has been pardoned. Mr. Harding, Barbara and Billy depart for New York, and Bridge returns to his vagabond life.

Criticism

Author Richard A. Lupoff placed it at fourth place on a reading list of essential Burroughs novels in his 1965 book Master of Adventure: The Worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Lupoff calls the novel "a most remarkable technical achievement" and states that "In a single book it is virtually a catalog of the pulps." However, Lupoff ranks The Return of the Mucker less highly (and criticizes it for its negative portrayal of Mexicans) and dismisses The Oakdale Affair'' as having little to recommend it.

Mikhail Dmitriyevich Tebenkov (also Tebenkof; 1802 – April 3, 1872) was a Russian hydrographer and vice admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy. From 1845 to 1850, he served as director of the Russian American Company and the governor of Russian America.

He is especially noted for having surveyed and mapped the still little-known coast of Alaska. His Atlas of the Northwest Coasts of America: from Bering Strait to Cape Corrientes and the Aleutian Islands was published in 1852 and contained 39 engraved maps.

Career

In 1821, Mikhail Tebenkov graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps School. For the next three years, he served on different ships in the Baltic Sea. In 1824, Tebenkov was put in charge of logging for shipbuilding purposes near Narva.

In January 1825, he joined the Russian American Company, which led colonizing and trade efforts in North America. He would later command the company-owned brigantines Golovnin, Ryurik, Chichagov, and a sloop named Urup in 1826–1834.
 
Tebenkov surveyed Norton Sound on behalf of the Imperial Russian Hydrographic Service in 1831 and was the first European to sight the bay that now bears his name. He surveyed Tebenkof Bay in 1833 before returning to St. Petersburg.

In 1835 Tebenkov sailed from Cronstadt back to Alaska via Cape Horn as commander of the Russian American Company's ship Elena. He arrived in Sitka in April 1836. Between 1845 and 1850, Tebenkov served as the director of the Russian American Company and the governor of Russian America.

Tebenkov was perhaps the most outstanding Russian surveyor of the time, dedicating much time and patient work to the improvement of charts of the Alaskan coast.

Legacy
Trebenkov's noted Atlas of the Northwest Coasts of America: from Bering Strait to Cape Corrientes and the Aleutian Islands was published in 1852. The 39 maps of this atlas were engraved at Sitka around 1849 by Kozma Terentev (or Terentief), an Alaskan-Russian creole man.

Besides Tebenkof Bay, other geographic features of Alaska, including Tebenkof Glacier, Mount Tebenkof and Point Tebenkof were named after Captain Mikhail Tebenkov.

Susan Mary Rees, FRS (born 31 July 1953) is a British mathematician and an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Liverpool since 2018, specialising in research in complex dynamical systems.

Career 
Rees was born in Cambridge. After obtaining her BA in 1974 and MSc in 1975 at St Hugh's College, Oxford, she did research in mathematics under the direction of Bill Parry at the University of Warwick, obtaining a PhD in 1978.  Her first postdoctoral position was at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1978 to 1979. Later she worked at Institut des hautes études scientifiques and the University of Minnesota. Following this she worked at the University of Liverpool until her retirement. She became professor of mathematics in 2002 and retired in 2018, becoming an emeritus professor.

She was awarded a Whitehead Prize of the London Mathematical Society in 1988. The citation notes that, in particular,Her most spectacular theorem has been to show that in the space of rational maps of the Riemann sphere of degree d ≥ 2 those maps that are ergodic with respect to Lebesgue measure and leave invariant an absolutely continuous probability measure form a set of positive measure.

She also spoke at the ICM at Kyoto in 1990.  In recent years, much of Rees' work has focused on the dynamics of quadratic rational maps; i.e. rational maps of the Riemann sphere of degree two, including an extensive monograph. In 2004, she also presented an alternative proof of the Ending Laminations Conjecture of Thurston, which had been proved by Brock, Canary and Minsky shortly before.

FRS
She was elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society in 2002.

Family
Her father David Rees was also a distinguished mathematician, who worked on Enigma in Hut 6 at Bletchley Park.  Her sister Sarah Rees is also a mathematician.

Actua Golf 2 (Fox Sports Golf '99 in North America) is a sports video game developed and published by Gremlin Interactive for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. Development of the game was underway as of August 1997, and it was released in September 1997 in Europe, and in June 1998 in North America. A Sega Saturn version was planned, but eventually cancelled.

Gameplay
The Windows version of the game has eight golf courses, and the PlayStation version has six courses. Both versions include three real courses: The Oxfordshire, Carnoustie Links, and Kiawah Island Ocean Course. Both versions of the game use a traditional click-based method to perform golf moves. The Windows version also includes a method in which the movement of the computer mouse is used to simulate the golf club. The Windows version has several multiplayer options, including modem and LAN.

Game modes include match play, skins, stroke play, four-ball, and foursome. The player can customize the golfer's appearance with selectable clothing, and can also choose a name for the golfer. The game features Peter Alliss and John Walls as golf commentators.

Reception

The PC version received above-average reviews, while the PlayStation version received unfavourable reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Many critics felt that the game was inferior to golf game series such as Links, Jack Nicklaus, and PGA Tour. Gordon Goble of CNET Gamecenter reviewed the Windows version and wrote that the game, "for all its charms and potential, feels unfinished. And this sense of incompleteness does not confine itself to the periphery--it will often impact the quality of your play."

Jason Zimring of GameRevolution considered the PlayStation version to be a poor game, writing, "The graphics are weak, the gameplay moves slowly, and the putting is sure to give you high blood pressure." Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame gave the same console version two-and-a-half stars out of five, writing, "In the end, it's just too hard to ignore the game's flaws despite some of the more promising features." Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine called the game "a bit rough around the edges" and stated that it "lacks the realism provided by most of the competition, but it's a real bargain and can be lots of fun."

Some critics considered the Windows version superior to the PlayStation version. The graphics of the Windows version were well received. Calvin Hubble of GameRevolution praised the Windows version for its "damn fine" water-reflection effect, and Craig Harris of IGN praised the moving water. Tasos Kaiafas of Computer Gaming World praised graphical effects such as swaying trees and the reflective, moving water, but stated that the graphics overall were lacking in comparison to rival golf games. Ryan considered the background graphics "rather plain" but stated that the overall look of the game "is surprisingly smooth and convincing."

The putting was criticized for its difficulty. Stephen Poole of GameSpot wrote that the putting interface was "one of the most frustrating ever seen," writing, "There's very little difference in the distance on the swing meter for, say, a 50-footer and a 10-footer; in other words, the difficulty of a putt increases as the distance to the hole decreases - the exact opposite of real golf." Kaiafas wrote, "The problem is the swing meter doesn't adjust for the shorter length, so you have to do some fast clicking to get it right." Goble felt that putting was too easy when using the mouse swing method. He also criticized the design of the swing meter, describing it as a "horridly rough-looking gauge". James Mielke of GameSpot also criticized the swing meter design in his review of the PlayStation version. Ryan criticized the putting interface, which he considered poor.

The commentary received some criticism, as reviewers considered it repetitive, although Goble did not view it as such. Poole complained of an error that prevented online multiplayer matches, but he stated that the game "gives you the highest degree of control over your shot type that I've seen in a golf sim." Hubble also praised the variety of golf swings.

The game sold 120,000 units.
Clan Forbes is a Highland Scottish clan from Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

History

Origins
The name Forbes is most probably a location name assumed from the lands of Forbes in Aberdeenshire, in possession of this family reputedly since the time of King William the Lion. While there are many legends surrounding the origins of this clan historians write the Forbes are descended from Kings of the Picts and a reliable tradition tells that the "Braes o’ Forbes" were once uninhabitable because of bears living in the area. Oconachar, founder of the clan, killed the bears and claimed the land as "first occupier". The present chief still holds part of the Lordship of these Forbes lands. The first person on record was Duncan Forbes who in 1271–2 received a grant of lands from Alexander III of Scotland. Cited by William Forbes Skene the charter exists in the Forbes charter chest in tattered but quite legible condition.

The next mention is a John Forbes, whose name dates from a 1306 roll containing a list of demands by English and Scottish loyalists to Edward I of England for the forfeited lands of Scotsmen, the lands of John Forbes being demanded or requested by both a William Comyn and a Robert Chival. The next name may be that of his son, Christian, who received a grant of one-third of the lands of Skeith and Ardach by King Robert the Bruce in 1326, but doubt still remains he was a Forbes or of this family, even though in the charter he is named Christian Forbes.

The next name found in records is that of John Forbes dominus ejusdem or Lord of Forbes. He witnessed two charters of Thomas, Earl of Mar in 1358 and 1359 and in 1364 King David II of Scotland confirmed a charter for the lands of Edinbanchory and Craiglogy by Thomas, Earl of Mar granting them to John de Forbes. He was Sheriff of Aberdeen in 1374. In 1378 a charter was granted to John and his wife Margaret by the Bishop of Moray for the lands of Fynrossie on the loch of Spynie. At his death before 20 August 1387 he was described as "a gude man, wise, and mychty, and manly in his time."

The son of the latter, Sir John de Forbes, Lord of Forbes, called "Sir John of the black lip" was Justiciary and Coroner of Aberdeenshire. He married Elizabeth Kennedy, daughter of Sir Gilbert Kennedy of Dunure and together they had four sons. From the three younger sons sprang several cadet lines. William was the progenitor of the Pitsligo line, John the ancestor of Tolquhonline while the houses of Skellater and Inverernan were founded by Alistair of Brux. Sir John died in 1406.

15th century
Sir John Forbes's son, Alexander Forbes, 1st Lord Forbes fought at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, in support of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Alexander had safe conduct from Henry V of England to visit his king, James I of Scotland at Rouen in 1421 and was allowed as his escort to bring forty Pikeman and other followers, up to one hundred men. He married Elizabeth, daughter of George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus and his wife Mary, daughter of Robert III of Scotland. Together Alexander and Elizabeth had five children including James, the 2nd Lord Forbes. Alexander Forbes was raised to the Peerage by James I as Baron Forbes between October 1444 and July 1445. Alexander Forbes, 1st Lord Forbes died in 1448.

James, second Lord Forbes, married Egidia, daughter of William Keith, 1st Earl Marischal, and had three sons: William, the 3rd Lord Forbes, Duncan, ancestor of the Forbeses of Corsindae and Monymusk, and Patrick, ancestor of the Forbeses, Baronets of Craigievar, now Lord Sempill, and also of the Earls of Granard.

Alexander, fourth Lord Forbes, was in arms with his clan to revenge the murder of James III, but after the defeat at Tillymoss he submitted to James IV. John, the sixth Lord, succeeded his brother Arthur, the 5th Lord Forbes, in 1493. In 1536 he was charged with treason and was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, but was honourably acquitted after a long period of confinement. John Forbes, Master of Forbes, his eldest surviving son and heir designate was arrested with his father, also on charges of treason, and was condemned to be hanged, but due to his rank he was beheaded.

16th century
In 1529, Clan Forbes was involved in a feud with the citizens of Aberdeen, who withheld a sort of blackmail, a yearly tun of wine for the fishings of the Don. In July 1530 Arthur Forbes of Brux and his accomplices attacked Aberdeen. The citizens took arms and drove the invaders to Greyfriars Place. The street fights lasted twenty-four hours. One member of clan Forbes and some of the citizens were killed, a good many on both sides were wounded. Several of the inhabitants of Aberdeen, and commissioners were sent to the king to lodge a complaint. On 19 December the following year, the magistrates served letters of law-burrows against Pitsligo, Tolquhon, Corsindae, Brux, Echt, and other gentlemen of the name of Forbes and Lord Pitsligo was obliged to find caution to the council at Perth for his own and friends good behaviour towards the town of Aberdeen. At that time a deadly feud subsisted between Clan Forbes and Clan Leslie; and it is probable that some of the Aberdeen townsfolk had interfered in that quarrel, which furiously raged throughout Aberdeenshire, and was attended by mutual massacres and murders.

Throughout the 16th century the Clan Forbes were involved in a long and bitter struggle against the Clan Gordon. In the 1520s there were murders by both sides, and one of the most prominent killed by the Forbeses was Seton of Meldrum who was a close connection of the Earl of Huntly, chief of Clan Gordon. The Earl of Huntly then became involved in a plot against the Master of Forbes, who was the son of the sixth Lord Forbes. The sixth Lord Forbes had been heavily implicated of the murder of Seton of Meldrum. The Master of Forbes was accused by the Earl of Huntly of conspiring to assassinate James V of Scotland in 1536 by shooting at him with a cannon. The Master of Forbes was tried and sentenced to be executed; just days later, however, his conviction was reversed and the Forbes family was restored to favor. The Protestant Reformation added to the feud between the Clan Forbes and Clan Gordon in that the Gordons remained Catholic and the Forbeses became Protestant. The traditional enemies of the Forbeses, such as the Clan Leslie, Clan Irvine and Clan Seton, sided with the Gordons, while Protestant families, such as the Clan Keith, Clan Fraser and Clan Crichton, sided with the Clan Forbes. Twenty Gordons were killed at a banquet held at the Forbeses' Druminnor Castle in 1571. Later in 1571 the feud climaxed with the Battle of Tillieangus, and the Battle of Craibstone, and Druminnor, then the seat of the chief of Clan Forbes, was plundered. The Gordons followed this with the massacre of twenty-seven Forbeses of Towie at Corgarff Castle. It took two Acts of Parliament for the clans to put down their arms.

17th century
Alexander, the 10th Lord Forbes, was a Lieutenant general under Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years' War. On his return to Scotland he was given a commission and charged with suppressing uprisings in Ireland. He later retired to Germany and died on 20 April 1672 in Stockholm, Sweden.

18th century

During the Jacobite risings the Jacobites laid siege to Culloden House, seat of Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden, a staunch Whig, in both the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the Jacobite rising of 1745. General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724 gives the number of men under of Forbes of Culloden as two hundred.
In September 1745, he was given a commission to raise twenty Independent Highland Companies to oppose the Jacobite rising of 1745. He succeeded in raising a total of eighteen Independent Highland Companies to fight against the Jacobites.

Branches

The Lords Forbes of Pitsligo were descended from William, second son of Sir John Forbes of that Ilk, in the time of Robert II. Alexander, fourth Lord, was attainted after the battle of Culloden; living long secretly in one of his own gate lodges, he died in 1762. Three families now claim the title.

The Forbeses, Baronets of Craigievar, a branch of the old House, Craigievar Castle, sprang from Patrick Forbes of Corse, armour-bearer to James III; and the Stuart-Forbesses of Pitsligo, Baronets, from Duncan of Corsindae, second son of James, second Lord Forbes. The Edinglassie Forbeses are also a branch of the parent stock.

The Forbeses of Tolquhon Castle, a very old branch, acquired that estate in 1420, and were
progenitors of the Lairds of Culloden. Sir Alexander Forbes of Tolquhon commanded a troop of cavalry in the Scots army at Worcester; and when the King's horse was shot, mounted him on his own, put his buff coat and a bloody scarf about him, and saw him safe out of the field. The fortunes of this house were probably consumed in the fever of the Darien Scheme, in which Alexander Forbes of Tolquhon (like many other good old Scottish families) appears to have embarked beyond his means, the stock he held (500) having been judicially attached.

Sir William Forbes, eighth Baronet of Craigievar, in 1884 succeeded his kinswoman as Lord Sempill, Chief of Clan Sempill.

Castles
Castles that have been owned by the Clan Forbes have included amongst many others:

Castlehill at Druminnor, one and a half miles north-east of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, was the site of the first stronghold on the lands, which the Forbeses held from 1271 to 1440. They then moved to Druminnor Castle.
Druminnor Castle, one mile south-east of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, consists of a keep and tower that has been much altered and was first built by the Forbeses in the fifteenth century. It was modified in the sixteenth century when it was made into an L-plan and there have also been later alterations. The Forbeses feuded with the Leslies, Setons, and the powerful Clan Gordon; twenty Gordons were killed at a banquet held at Druminnor Castle in 1571. In 1770 Druminnor Castle was sold, and the Forbes family moved to Castle Forbes.
Castle Forbes, a few miles northeast of Alford, Aberdeenshire, was once a tower house, but was replaced with a large castellated mansion of 1815.
Craigievar Castle, four and a half miles southwest of Alford, Aberdeenshire, was built by the Forbeses. It is an L-plan tower house of seven storeys. The castle was actually started by the Mortimer family but they ran out of money and it was completed by the Forbeses. The castle was taken over by the National Trust for Scotland in 1963 and is now open to the public.
Tolquhon Castle, four miles east of Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, is a ruinous keep and courtyard castle. The original castle was built by the Prestons of Craigmillar, but it passed by marriage to the Forbeses in 1420, and they completed the castle. Sir Alexander Forbes, sixth laird of the castle, was killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. The present castle was built by William Forbes, the seventh laird. The tenth Forbes laird of Tolquhon saved Charles II of England's life at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. In 1716 the Forbeses sold the castle to the Farquhars to help cover their losses in the Darien scheme, but the eleventh Forbes laird had to be forcibly removed from the castle by a detachment of soldiers in 1718.
Corgarff Castle is in a remote spot ten miles northwest of Ballater, Aberdeenshire, and is a tall tower house. It is four storeys high and dates from the sixteenth century. It is the site of one of the most infamous events of the bitter feud between the Clan Forbes and Clan Gordon: a force under Adam Gordon of Auchindoun ravaged through the Forbeses' lands and besieged the castle, which was held by twenty-six women, children, and servants, the men being away. Margaret Campbell, wife of Forbes of Towie, refused to surrender the castle. Gordon of Auchindoun lost patience when she shot one of his men in the knee; Gordon then torched the building, killing everyone inside.
Culloden House at Culloden, Highland near Inverness mostly dates from the eighteenth century, but stands on the site of a strong tower house which was formerly held by the Mackintoshes and Edmonstones, but was sold to the Forbeses in 1626. It was the seat of Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden, who supported the British-Hanoverian Government during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and was present at the Battle of Culloden. He later protested against the cruel and dishonorable treatment of Jacobite prisoners after the battle, when many wounded Jacobites were brought to Culloden House and were shot or had their heads crushed with musket butts.
The 1971 East Carolina Pirates football team was an American football team that represented East Carolina University as a member of the Southern Conference during the 1971 NCAA University Division football season. In their first season under head coach Sonny Randle, the team compiled a 4–6 record.

History 
In 1931, the DRG ordered ten locomotives from the firm of Henschel that were taken into the fleet as numbers 85 001 to 85 010. The Class 85 was intended for hauling passenger and goods trains. They were however also employed as pusher locomotives on the Höllentalbahn in the Black Forest. Thanks to this engine, the Höllental Railway could do away with rack railway operations from 1933. The running gear and the superheated system were taken from the  Class 44. The boiler, with a few minor alterations, was the same as that of the Class 62. All the locomotives were stabled at the Freiburg shed. Apart from number 85 004, which was lost in the Second World War, all the engines were in operation in the Black Forest until 1961, the year the route was converted from experimental electrical operations with 20 kV/50 Hz lines to the usual Deutsche Bundesbahn standard of . One engine, number 85 007, was still in service in Wuppertal until the end of the year, but they were all retired by the beginning of the next year.

Preserved locomotives 
Number 85 007 belongs to the town of Freiburg im Breisgau. It is not operational, but is maintained by the Bahn-Sozialwerk-Gruppe. The engine is housed in the former locomotive shed.

Telocator Alphanumeric Protocol (TAP) is an industry-standard protocol for sending short messages via a land-line modem to a provider of pager and/or SMS services, for onward transmission to pagers and mobile phones.

TAP, initially known as Motorola Page Entry (PET) was adopted in September 1988, by the Personal Communication Industry Association.  TAP defines an industry standard for sending alphanumeric messages to pagers.

TAP was also known as IXO protocol.  Originally, devices like the IXO Device were used to send Alphanumeric Pages using TAP.  Later, Motorola would create a similar device called the AlphaMate.

TAP Communication Protocol 
The standard protocol is ASCII with XON/XOFF flow control, using a 10-bit code (1 start bit, 7 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit). No echo shall be employed in full duplex mode.
The Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre is an aquatics centre that is part of the City of Sports Complex in the Barra da Tijuca district of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is part of the investments made by the city to host the swimming, synchronized swimming and diving competitions of the 2007 Pan American Games. During the 2016 Summer Olympics, it hosted group matches of water polo and the synchronised swimming and diving competitions. The name of the water park is a tribute to the Brazilian swimmer, Maria Lenk, who died less than three months before its inauguration.

The water park was designed in accordance with established parameters and specifications of the International Swimming Federation (FINA). It is partially covered and includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool, an indoor heating and a tank for diving.

The complex has the capacity to receive about 8,000 people. The construction area is . The facility has also been designed according to the specifications required to achieve the Parapan American Games of 2007, as well as environments and equipment ready to receive people with special needs.

In March 2008, the facility came under the administration of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, which has been involved in training for Olympic and Paralympic athletes, coaches and officials, as well as courses, conferences, workshops, gym and small schools of swimming, water polo, diving and synchronized swimming. Until 2009, the BOC did not do any sports activity on the site.

The park, as well as other facilities built for the achievement of the Pan American Games, was one of the major assets of the city's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The aquatics centre was intended to be adapted into community facilities in Madureira Park and the Campo Grande area. In February 2017, a reporter commented that the aquatics centre had become a white elephant, abandoned and left to crumble, less than a year after the games.
The London Correctional Institution (LoCI) is located in Union Township, Madison County, just west of London, Ohio,  southwest of Columbus. It was originally known as the London Prison Farm. From 1913 to 1925 it was a branch of the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus. In 1925, it became a separate facility. The prison currently accommodates approximately: 2,500 adult males in three security levels: minimum, medium and close-security.

Construction and Ohio State inmates 
When the London Prison Farm was first proposed, there were two possible locations, Plain City and London. The decision was made to build the prison in London and the land, most of which was swamp, was purchased from John Ellsworth. In 1910, honor inmates were transported from the Ohio Penitentiary to London by railway to construct the prison.

Facilities for the inmates 
Originally, prisoners were housed in dormitories, each of which held around 300 men. There were isolation cells in case an inmate had to be punished. By March 1928, the prison housed 507 inmates. All the inmates were examined at the Ohio Penitentiary and if the men didn't have any diseases, they were shipped to the Farm. The London Prison Farm had different types of vocational training, but no educational program for the inmates. Today, London is one of the least costly institutions in Ohio's DR&C to operate.

Present day 
The London Correctional Institution now owns around . Over $30 million have been spent to renovate the prison. As of November 2013, the population was 2,283 inmates. The prison has a staff of 379 employees.

Programs for the inmates 
The London Correctional Institution provides programs for the inmates, such as the Family Life Centers and The New Beginnings Unit. Now, the facility has a reading room for inmates and their children. Inmates are also able to earn their GEDs and other academic diplomas. Vocational programs include auto technology, barbering, dental lab, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning), web based design, animal training, and culinary arts.
Cytinaceae is a family of parasitic flowering plants. It comprises two genera, Cytinus and Bdallophytum, totalling ten species.

These two genera were formerly placed in the family Rafflesiaceae, order Malpighiales. When they were separated into a new family, it was initially placed in Malpighiales, but it has since been recognised as belonging to order Malvales.
Bishop Auckland Town Hall is a municipal facility in the Market Place, Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, England. It is a Grade II* listed building.

History
The building, which was designed by John Philpott Jones in the Gothic Revival style for the Bishop Auckland Town Hall and Market Company, was financed by private issue of shares and officially opened on 28 October 1862. When it opened facilities included a large lecture hall capable of accommodating 800 people and a temperance hotel. The building held a prominent position in the town and dominated the area with its strong mansard pavilions, spires and associated ironwork. The mansard pavilions were an unusual feature imported from France which were copied a few years later by Bellamy and Hardy in their design for Retford Town Hall.

The building was acquired by the local board of health in 1888 and it became the headquarters of Bishop Auckland Urban District council in 1894. Sir Edward Elgar visited the building on 2 December 1919 and conducted the Leeds Symphony Orchestra playing a series of pieces of his own work.

After Bishop Auckland Urban District Council was abolished in 1974, the building was abandoned and then condemned for demolition in the 1980s; however, after a local campaign to save the building, it was fully restored in the early 1990s. The works included the conversion of the main assembly hall into a facility known as the Eden Theatre to commemorate a previous theatre of that name in Newgate Street which had been demolished in 1974. The changes also introduced a new public library, an art gallery, a tourist information centre and a café. The complex was officially re-opened in September 1993 and the restoration in the complex was recognised with a Civic Trust Award in 1995.

The art gallery went on to hold three exhibitions for mining artist Tom Lamb. The first was held in 1999 for his "Fading Memories" exhibition, then in 2004 for Lamb's "The Footprints Of My Years" exhibition and in 2008 the last exhibition called "My Mining Days" was held.

The building closed for a further refurbishment involving a new layout to the art gallery and expected to cost £1.9 million in September 2019.
Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm developed by Peter Schmid in 2008.
Given a time series of data, DMD computes a set of modes each of which is associated with a fixed oscillation frequency and decay/growth rate.  For linear systems in particular, these modes and frequencies are analogous to the normal modes of the system, but more generally, they are approximations of the modes and eigenvalues of the composition operator (also called the Koopman operator).  Due to the intrinsic temporal behaviors associated with each mode, DMD differs from dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis, which computes orthogonal modes that lack predetermined temporal behaviors.  Because its modes are not orthogonal, DMD-based representations can be less parsimonious than those generated by PCA.  However, they can also be more physically meaningful because each mode is associated with a damped (or driven) sinusoidal behavior in time.

Overview
Dynamic mode decomposition was first introduced by Schmid as a numerical procedure for extracting dynamical features from flow data.

The data takes the form of a snapshot sequence 
 
where  is the -th snapshot of the flow field, and  is a data matrix whose columns are the individual snapshots.   These snapshots are assumed to be related via a linear mapping that defines a linear dynamical system
  
that remains approximately the same over the duration of the sampling period. Written in matrix form, this implies that 

where  is the vector of residuals that accounts for behaviors that cannot be described completely by , , , and .  Regardless of the approach, the output of DMD is the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of , which are referred to as the DMD eigenvalues and DMD modes respectively.

Algorithm 

There are two methods for obtaining these eigenvalues and modes. The first is Arnoldi-like, which is useful for theoretical analysis due to its connection with Krylov methods.  The second is a singular value decomposition (SVD) based approach that is more robust to noise in the data and to numerical errors.

The Arnoldi approach 

In fluids applications, the size of a snapshot, , is assumed to be much larger than the number of snapshots , so there are many equally valid choices of .  The original DMD algorithm picks  so that each of the snapshots in  can be expressed as linear combinations of the snapshots in .
Because most of the snapshots appear in both data sets, this representation is error free for all snapshots except , which is written as 

where  is a set of coefficients DMD must identify and  is the residual.
In total, 
 
where  is the companion matrix

The vector  can be computed by solving a least squares problem, which minimizes the overall residual.  In particular if we take the QR decomposition of , then .

In this form, DMD is a type of Arnoldi method, and therefore the eigenvalues of  are approximations of the eigenvalues of .  Furthermore, if  is an eigenvector of , then  is an approximate eigenvector of . The reason an eigendecomposition is performed on  rather than  is because  is much smaller than , so the computational cost of DMD is determined by the number of snapshots rather than the size of a snapshot.

The SVD-based approach 

Instead of computing the companion matrix , the SVD-based approach yields the matrix  that is related to  via a similarity transform.  To do this, assume we have the SVD of .  Then 

Equivalent to the assumption made by the Arnoldi-based approach, we choose  such that the snapshots in  can be written as the linear superposition of the columns in , which is equivalent to requiring that they can be written as the superposition of POD modes.  With this restriction, minimizing the residual requires that it is orthogonal to the POD basis (i.e.).  Then multiplying both sides of the equation above by  yields , which can be manipulated to obtain

Because  and  are related via similarity transform, the eigenvalues of  are the eigenvalues of , and if  is an eigenvector of , then  is an eigenvector of .

In summary, the SVD-based approach is as follows:
 Split the time series of data in   into the two matrices  and . 
 Compute the SVD of .
 Form the matrix , and compute its eigenvalues  and eigenvectors .
 The -th DMD eigenvalue is  and -th DMD mode is the .

The advantage of the SVD-based approach over the Arnoldi-like approach is that noise in the data and numerical truncation issues can be compensated for by truncating the SVD of .  As noted in   accurately computing more than the first couple modes and eigenvalues can be difficult on experimental data sets without this truncation step.

Theoretical and algorithmic advancements 

Since its inception in 2010, a considerable amount of work has focused on understanding and improving DMD.  One of the first analyses of DMD by Rowley et al. established the connection between DMD and the Koopman operator, and helped to explain the output of DMD when applied to nonlinear systems.  Since then, a number of modifications have been developed that either strengthen this connection further or enhance the robustness and applicability of the approach.

Optimized DMD: Optimized DMD is a modification of the original DMD algorithm designed to compensate for two limitations of that approach: (i) the difficulty of DMD mode selection, and (ii) the sensitivity of DMD to noise or other errors in the last snapshot of the time series.  Optimized DMD recasts the DMD procedure as an optimization problem where the identified linear operator has a fixed rank.  Furthermore, unlike DMD which perfectly reproduces all of the snapshots except for the last, Optimized DMD allows the reconstruction errors to be distributed throughout the data set, which appears to make the approach more robust in practice.
Optimal Mode Decomposition: Optimal Mode Decomposition (OMD) recasts the DMD procedure as an optimization problem and allows the user to directly impose the rank of the identified system.  Provided this rank is chosen properly, OMD can produce linear models with smaller residual errors and more accurate eigenvalues on both synthetic and experimental data sets.
Exact DMD: The Exact DMD algorithm generalizes the original DMD algorithm in two ways.  First, in the original DMD algorithm the data must be a time series of snapshots, but Exact DMD accepts a data set of snapshot pairs.  The snapshots in the pair must be separated by a fixed , but do not need to be drawn from a single time series.  In particular, Exact DMD can allow data from multiple experiments to be aggregated into a single data set.  Second, the original DMD algorithm effectively pre-processes the data by projecting onto a set of POD modes.  The Exact DMD algorithm removes this pre-processing step, and can produce DMD modes that cannot be written as the superposition of POD modes.
Sparsity Promoting DMD: Sparsity promoting DMD is a post processing procedure for DMD mode and eigenvalue selection.  Sparsity promoting DMD uses an  penalty to identify a smaller set of important DMD modes, and is an alternative approach to the DMD mode selection problem that can be solved efficiently using convex optimization techniques.
Multi-Resolution DMD: Multi-Resolution DMD (mrDMD) is a combination of the techniques used in multiresolution analysis with Exact DMD designed to robust extracting DMD modes and eigenvalues from data sets containing multiple timescales.  The mrDMD approach was applied to global surface temperature data, and identifies a DMD mode that appears during  El Nino years.
Extended DMD: Extended DMD is a modification of Exact DMD that strengthens the connection between DMD and the Koopman operator.  As the name implies, Extended DMD is an extension of DMD that uses a richer set of observable functions to produce more accurate approximations of the Koopman operator. This extended set could be chosen a priori or learned from data. It also demonstrated the DMD and related methods produce approximations of the Koopman eigenfunctions in addition to the more commonly used eigenvalues and modes.
DMD with Control: Dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc)  is a modification of the DMD procedure designed for data obtained from input output systems. One unique feature of DMDc is the ability to disambiguate the effects of system actuation from the open loop dynamics, which is useful when data are obtained in the presence of actuation.
Total Least Squares DMD: Total Least Squares DMD is a recent modification of Exact DMD meant to address issues of robustness to measurement noise in the data.  In, the authors interpret the Exact DMD as a regression problem that is solved using ordinary least squares (OLS), which assumes that the regressors are noise free.  This assumption creates a bias in the DMD eigenvalues when it is applied to experimental data sets where all of the observations are noisy.  Total least squares DMD replaces the OLS problem with a total least squares problem, which eliminates this bias.
Dynamic Distribution Decomposition: DDD focuses on the forward problem in continuous time, i.e., the transfer operator. However the method developed can also be used for fitting DMD problems in continuous time.

In addition to the algorithms listed here, similar application-specific techniques have been developed.  For example, like DMD, Prony's method represents a signal as the superposition of damped sinusoids.  In climate science, linear inverse modeling is also strongly connected with DMD.  For a more comprehensive list, see Tu et al.

Examples

Trailing edge of a profile 

The wake of an obstacle in the flow may develop a  Kármán vortex street. The Fig.1 shows the shedding of a vortex behind the trailing edge of a profile. The DMD-analysis was applied to 90 sequential Entropy fields  and yield an approximated eigenvalue-spectrum as depicted below. The analysis was applied to the numerical results, without referring to the governing equations. The profile is seen in white. The white arcs are the processor boundaries since the computation was performed on a parallel computer using different computational blocks.

Roughly a third of the spectrum was highly damped (large, negative) and is not shown.  The dominant shedding mode is shown in the following pictures. The image to the left is the real part, the image to the right, the imaginary part of the eigenvector.

Again, the entropy-eigenvector is shown in this picture. The acoustic contents of the same mode is seen in the bottom half of the next plot. The top half corresponds to the entropy mode as above.

Synthetic example of a traveling pattern 
The DMD analysis assumes a pattern of the form

where  is any of the independent variables of the problem, but has to be selected in advance.
Take for example the pattern

With  the time as the preselected exponential factor.

A sample is given in the following figure with ,  and . The left picture shows the pattern without, the right with noise added. The amplitude of the random noise is the same as that of the pattern.

A DMD analysis is performed with 21 synthetically generated fields using a time interval  , limiting the analysis to .

The spectrum is symmetric and shows three almost undamped modes (small negative real part), whereas the other modes are heavily damped.
Their numerical values are  respectively. The real one corresponds to the mean of the field, whereas  corresponds to the imposed pattern with . Yielding a relative error of −1/1000. Increasing the noise to 10 times the signal value yields about the same error. The real and imaginary part of one of the latter two eigenmodes is depicted in the following figure.
Dr. Levi Fox OBE, DL, MA, FSA, FRHistS, FRSL (28 August 1914 – 3 September 2006), was the son of a Leicestershire smallholder. He became Archivist for the city of Coventry and then Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, and was a conservationist, local historian, and author.

Birth and early life
Fox was born on 28 August 1914 in Worthington, Leicestershire. He was the sixth of seven siblings. His father was John William Fox, a coalminer, and his mother was Julia Sophia Fox (née Stinson). After attending Ashby-de-la-Zouch Grammar School where he became head boy, Fox was a Bryce research student in Oriel College, Oxford and gained a first class Honours degree in History. He then spent some time doing research at the University of Manchester before being appointed the first city archivist for Coventry.

Shakespeare Birthplace Trust

Declared unfit for war service, Fox was appointed Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT) in 1945 and built a loyal team around him.

The SBT can lay claim to be the oldest conservation society in Britain. Under Fox's direction many activities of the Trust, including its education work, records office, museums and gardens departments, and its conservation activities, developed and expanded greatly; and he saw the centre at Stratford-upon-Avon grow from a local organisation of some national significance into a body of international repute. The SBT is entirely dependent on its income from visitors to the Shakespeare properties and investments, and, under Fox it acquired some important properties. These include the land around Anne Hathaway's cottage and Hall's Croft, the home of Shakespeare's daughter and her husband, John Hall; as well as Glebe Farm at Wilmcote, next to the supposed childhood home of Shakespeare's mother (Mary Arden), when it was threatened by developers in 1968.

A major landmark was the opening of the Shakespeare Centre in Henley Street, next to Shakespeare's Birthplace, in 1964; built to better accommodate the SBT's library and collection of documents that attract scholars from all over the world. Fox worked tirelessly to further the cause of Shakespeare, served as secretary and deputy Chairman of the International Shakespeare Committee, and produced numerous books and articles. Also in 1964, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from The George Washington University.

On the occasion of his retirement from the SBT on 26 September 1989, Fox unveiled a commemorative plaque commissioned by the Executive Committee of the Trust in recognition of his service and achievements as its director. The plaque was carved by Paul Vincze with letters by Richard James Kindersley and hangs in the foyer of the Shakespeare Centre.

In retirement from the age of 75 years, as Director Emeritus of the Trust Fox continued to take great interest in its affairs. He was enthusiastic about such changes as the transition from the museum feel of the SBT's historic houses into more accurately exhibited and lively period homes. He was particularly pleased to discover in 2000 that Glebe Farm, the house he had saved from destruction, was the genuine home of Shakespeare's mother.

Other activities
Fox held the position of Deputy Keeper of the Records of Stratford-Upon-Avon, and from 1949–91 he was a trustee of Harvard House, home to the mother of the founder of Harvard University. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls, and of King Edward VI School for Boys where the Levi Fox Hall, opened in 1997, is named in his honour.> He was the founder Chairman of the Friends of the Guild Chapel of Stratford-upon-Avon, a position he held for 50 years during which time the crumbling structure of the building was comprehensively restored and beautified.

He was an eminent local historian, and published extensively on the history of Stratford-upon-Avon and on the Midlands in general, serving for many years as secretary and general editor of the Dugdale Society.
Andrija Prlainović (born 28 April 1987) is a Serbian professional water polo player widely regarded as one of the greatest players ever. He was a member of the Serbia men's national water polo teams that won bronze medals at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics and gold medals in 2016 and 2020. He also held the world title in 2009 and 2015 and the European title in 2006, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.

The Palacio de los Reyes de Navarra, also called the Palacio de los Duques de Granada de Ega, is a historical building in Estella, Navarre, Spain; it is the Romanesque former royal palace of the Kings and Queens of Navarre from the late 12th century to the mid-15th. In the twentieth century the building, which had fallen into disrepair, was restored and in 1991 converted into the Museo Gustavo de Maeztu, housing the work of the painter Gustavo de Maeztu y Whitney and open to the public. The building is important in the history of architecture in Navarre, since it is the only civil building extant from the Romanesque period. In 1931, it was declared a national monument by the Spanish government.

Description

It is a Romanesque building built in the second half of 12th century, located in the Plaza de San Martín and on the corner of Calle de San Nicolás, an ancient entrance for pilgrims.

The most significant element is the main facade, located opposite the stairway of San Pedro de la Rúa. It consists of two floors built in ashlar masonry, which are divided in height by a simple molded cornice. The lower body is a gallery of four arches framed by columns attached to the wall, decorated with capitals of vegetable and figurative type.

On the left side there are figures of stylized forms that narrate an episode of the Legend of Roland, specifically the scene of Roldan's fight against the giant Ferragut, trying to exemplify the struggle of good against evil. It is signed by Martinus of Logroño. On the right side, the decoration is formed by thin leaves of penca, Cistercian rooted.

The second floor has four large windows, each divided into its internal space by four slightly pointed arches that rest on fine encapsulated columns adorned with plant, animal and figurative decoration. Above them, a cornice with sculpted corbels. Here the original forms alternate with recent reconstructions, given that over time the structure was modified to adapt to the needs and diverse functions that it has had as a palace and as a prison for the judicial district.

It is closed on its sides by two semi-columns, with a decorative scheme on its different capitals. On the left is a capital with plant decoration, while on the right side you can see a set where scenes have been conceived related to the sin of pride, the punishment of hell and lust.

The third floor, work of the 18th century, is built in brick.

Since June 14, 1991, it has housed the painter's museum Gustavo de Maeztu. The rooms of the museum are distributed in the last two floors of the building and house paintings, drawings, lithographs and other pieces by this painter, one of the most important of the so-called "Basque School".

The Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus (OPERA) was an instrument used in a scientific experiment for detecting tau neutrinos from muon neutrino oscillations. The experiment is a collaboration between CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Gran Sasso, Italy and uses the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS) neutrino beam.

The process started with protons from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN being fired in pulses at a carbon target to produce pions and kaons. These particles decay to produce muons and neutrinos.

The beam from CERN was stopped on 3 December 2012, ending data taking, but the analysis of the collected data has continued.

Detector 

OPERA, in Hall C of the Gran Sasso underground labs, was built in 2003–2008. The taus resulting from the interaction of tau neutrinos are observed in "bricks" of photographic films (nuclear emulsion) interleaved with lead sheets. Each brick weighs 8.3 kg; the two OPERA supermodules contain 150,000 bricks arranged into parallel walls interleaved with plastic scintillator counters. Each supermodule is followed by a magnetic spectrometer for momentum and charge identification of penetrating particles. During data collection, a neutrino interaction and its corresponding brick are tagged in real time by the scintillators and spectrometers. These bricks are extracted from the walls asynchronously with respect to the beam for film development, scanning and for the topological and kinematic search of tau decays.

Tau neutrinos 

In total, five tau neutrinos were detected. On 31 May 2010, OPERA researchers observed the first tau neutrino candidate event in a muon neutrino beam. On 6 June 2012, OPERA announced the observation of a second tau neutrino event. On 26 March 2013, the experiment caught for the third time a muon neutrino oscillating into a tau neutrino during travel from CERN to LNGS. The fourth one was found in 2014, and the fifth was seen in 2015.

Time-of-flight measurements 

In September 2011, OPERA researchers observed muon neutrinos apparently traveling faster than the speed of light. In February and March 2012, OPERA researchers blamed this result on a loose fibre optic cable connecting a GPS receiver to an electronic card in a computer. On 16 March 2012, a report announced that an independent experiment in the same laboratory, also using the CNGS neutrino beam, but this time the ICARUS detector found no discernible difference between the speed of a neutrino and the speed of light. In May 2012, the Gran Sasso experiments BOREXINO, ICARUS, LVD and OPERA all measured neutrino velocity with a short-pulsed beam, and obtained agreement with the speed of light, showing that the original OPERA result was mistaken. Finally in July 2012, the OPERA collaboration updated their results. After the instrumental effects mentioned above were taken into account, it was shown that the speed of neutrinos is consistent with the speed of light. This was confirmed by a new, improved set of measurements in May 2013.

Chaves is a Portuguese wine region centered on the town of Chaves in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region. The region was initially a separate Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada (IPR) region, but in 2006, it became one of three subregions of the Trás-os-Montes DOC, which has the higher Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) status. Its name may still be indicated together with that of Trás-os-Montes, as Trás-os-Montes-Chaves.

Located along the Tamega river, the region produces light bodied wines that are similar in style to wines produces in the Douro DOC.

Grapes
The main grapes of the Chaves region include Bastardo, Boal, Codega, Gouveio, Malvasia Fina, Tinta Carvalha and Tinta Amarela.
Corentine Quiniou (born 16 May 1982 in Paris) is a French racing driver.

Early life
In a 2007 interview with Madmoizelle, Quiniou stated that she became interested in driving as a young girl while accompanying her father to amateur races, and that she began karting at age 14.

In 2001, she joined La Filière in Le Mans, learning formula racing while continuing her studies.

Racing career
In 2004, Quiniou finished third in Rallye des Princesses in an Alfa Romeo Spider Duetto.

The following year, she won the 2005 Rallye des Princesses in a Porsche 911, and placed in other races that year, finishing second in the Rallye Aicha des Gazelles and third in the Rallye Optic 2000 de Tunisie, in the T2 Diesel category driving a Toyota Land Cruiser.

In 2006 Quiniou and her teammate Florence Bourgnon finished 49th overall in the Dakar Rally in a Toyota Land Cruiser, the only women's team to complete the race. In 2006 and 2007 Quiniou won the Rallye Aicha des Gazelles. In 2007, she finished 8th overall in the Transafricaine Classic from Paris to Dakar, winning one stage and the all-female classification. During the same year, she finished fifth in the Classic Endurance Racing in Europe in a Chevron B16. In 2008, she won the Classic Endurance Racing in a Chevron B16, both in Proto 1 ranking and in the drivers' ranking. In the same year she had to withdraw from this edition of Rallye Aicha des Gazelles after the second stage due to a mechanical problem.

Quiniou and her partner achieved a victory in 2009 Rallye Aicha des Gazelles. In a Ford Focus ST she participated in 24 Hours Nürburgring on 24 May, where she placed 100th overall and third of three finishers in her category. Between her participation in the Classic Endurance Racing, Quiniou joined the Gstaad Classic Rally driving a Jaguar XK150.

In 2010 Quiniou entered the Dubai 24 Hour in an Aston Martin V8 Vantage GT4 of Nicholas Mee Racing, finishing eighth of ten finishers in class and 49th overall. In her first attempt of Le Tour Auto-Optic 2000, Quiniou placed 25th overall, driving a Jaguar E-Type.

Allegations of Misconduct

Quiniou and her navigator Florence Migraine Bourgnon on the Toyota team were disqualified in the 2010 Rallye Aicha des Gazelles for manipulation of their satellite tracking system and altering the odometer of their car. For the 2010 rally, the rules of the race were changed in an attempt to discover whether or not cheating was occurring, a question raised due to suspicions surrounding the Toyota team's record of three first place and one second-place finishes since 2005.

18th-century French male artistsNancy May McDonald (25 December 1921 – 7 January 1974) was an Australian poet and editor.

Biography
Nancy May McDonald was born in Eastwood, New South Wales, 25 December 1921. She attended Hornsby Girls' High School (1934–38), and studied at the University of Sydney (B.A., 1943).  She worked as an editor for Angus and Robertson, where she specialized in Australian literature, with colleagues such as Alec Bolton, Beatrice Davis and Douglas Stewart. In 1953 she edited the annual Anthology of Australian Poetry. She first published in 1947; a review of the collection, Pacific Sea, called her work "essentially Australian" and praised her "exquisite precision". Her poems have also been called "sombre and deathward-drawn". McDonald died aged 52 of cancer on 7 January 1974.

An [[obituary in the Australian Author noted R. D. Fitzgerald's description of McDonald as "the tranquil Australian poet". Several sources record that McDonald's work has yet to be assessed from a critical perspective.

 Awards and honours 
McDonald contributed to the school magazine at Hornsby Girls' High School, twice winning the school's Ethel Curlewis (née Turner) prize for verse.

Her first published collection of poetry, Pacific Sea (1947), won the inaugural Grace Leven Prize for Poetry.

The 1973 British League Division Two season was the second tier of motorcycle speedway in Great Britain.

Summary
The 1973 season saw the league expanded to 18 teams with the addition of Chesterton Potters. The team had last raced during the 1963 Provincial Speedway League season under the name of the Stoke Potters.

Boston Barracudas won their first title and went on to win the league and cup double. Boston had finished runner-up to Crewe Kings the previous season, with decent season averages recorded by five riders Arthur Price, Jim Ryman, Carl Glover, Russ Osborne and Ray Bales. With a largely unchanged team, they went one place better by sealing the league title. Boston won easily, 14 points clear of their nearest rival, and four of the five riders improved their averages from 1972. Arthur Price also won the Riders' Championship.

He also received the Borstnik Ring for lifetime achievement in the theater. In 2001, Šugman was awarded the Jezek Award for his television achievements. The Jezek jury noted his skill in expressing both humor and pain on screen.

Zlatko Šugman died in his home in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 16 December 2008, at the age of 76. His death was announced by the Mestno gledalisce ljubljansko (MGL) theatre.
Flowering Plants of Africa is a series of illustrated botanical magazines akin to Curtis's Botanical Magazine, initiated as Flowering Plants of South Africa by I. B. Pole-Evans in 1920. It is now published by the South African National Biodiversity Institute in Pretoria. The magazine depicts and describes flowering plants from Africa and its neighbouring islands. The issues are printed in soft cover measuring 250 x 190 mm.

The first volumes were printed in England by L. Reeve & Co. These first illustrations were done in black and white by lithography, zinc plates later replacing the stone. A copy of the original water colour guided teams of hand-colour artists who applied paint where needed. Hand-colouring was a family craft carried on from generation to generation. Single colour printing was occasionally done to help speed the process, especially when skilled hand-colour artists were in short supply, as happened in World War II.

Notable botanists who contributed to this journal include Anna Amelia Obermeyer and Josef Bogner.

Notable botanical artists who have contributed to its pages include Kathleen Annie Lansdell, Gillian Condy, Fay Anderson, Auriol Batten, Rosemary Holcroft, Betty Connell, Cythna Letty (who was responsible for over 700 plates), Barbara Pike and Ellaphie Ward-Hilhorst.

The series was edited by I. B. Pole-Evans (1921-1939), Edwin Percy Phillips (1940-1944), Robert Allen Dyer (1945-1964) and L. E. W. Codd.
Colobomycter is an extinct genus of lanthanosuchoid parareptile known from the Early Permian of Oklahoma.

Discovery 
The type species, Colobomycter pholeter, was first described from fossil remains in 1958, at which time it was believed to represent a synapsid, specifically, a pelycosaur. However, the discovery of new material and reexamination of the holotype led to its reclassification as a member of the Eureptilia. More recent studies indicate that Colobomycter is properly placed within the amniote clade Parareptilia, as part of the group Lanthanosuchoidea and closely related to the taxon Acleistorhinus. A second species of Colobomycter was described in 2016, Colobomycter vaughni.

No postcranial material is known for Colobomycter, and the skull material referred to the genus has all been recovered from a single locality, the Richards Spur site at the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry, 11 kilometers north of Fort Sill, Comanche County, Oklahoma, dating to the early Artinskian stage. This site comprises a fissure-fill deposit yielding a unique upland fauna. Other taxa recovered from these strata preserves a wide array of tetrapods, including lepospondyl and temnospondyl amphibians, Seymouria, microsaurs, captorhinomorphs, and synapsids.

Description 
The skull of Colobomycter is considered one of the most enigmatic found in any of the parareptiles primarily due to the presence of greatly enlarged caniniform teeth possessing serrated edges in the premaxilla and, to a lesser extent, the maxilla. The length of the premaxillary fang is greater than half the height of the skull. Modesto & Reisz (2008) note that "The large size of the first premaxillary tooth is [otherwise] unheard of among early reptiles." The taxon also possesses unusual "folding" of the dentine at the bases of its larger marginal teeth, a state known as polyplycodont (a condition also seen to have evolved independently in diadectomorphs, ichthyosaurs, and mosasaurs). Modesto & Reisz (2008) speculate that hard-shelled insects and other arthropods may have formed the bulk of its diet, but that Colobomycter could also have fed on vertebrates, including small amphibians and eureptiles. It is notable as the smallest predatory amniote from the Richard's Spur deposits, with a skull measuring a mere 70-80 millimeters in length.
Niger is governed through a four layer, semi-decentralised series of Administrative divisions. Begun 1992, and finally approved with the formation of the Fifth Republic of Niger on 18 July 1999, Niger has been enacting a plan for Decentralisation of some state powers to local bodies. Prior to the 1999-2006 project, Niger's subdivisions were administered via direct appointment from the central government in Niamey.  Beginning with Niger's first municipal elections of 2 February 1999, the nation started electing local officials for the first time.  Citizens now elect local committee representatives in each Commune, chosen by subdivisions of the commune: "Quarters" in towns and "Villages" in rural areas, with additional groupings for traditional polities and nomadic populations.  These officials choose Mayors, and from them are drawn representatives to the Department level.  The Departmental council, Prefect, and representatives to the Regional level are chosen here using the same procedure. The system is repeated a Regional level, with a Regional Prefect, council, and representatives to the High Council of Territorial Collectives (Le Haut Conseil des Collectivités Territoriales HCCT). The HCCT has only advisory powers, but its members (Regions, Departments, and Communes) have some financial, planning, educational and environmental powers.  The central government oversees this process through the office of the Minister of State for the Interior, Public Safety and Decentralization.

Current administrative structure
Niger is divided into 7 Regions (French: régions; singular – région). Each region's capital is the same as its name. Additionally, the national capital, Niamey, comprises a capital district.

Regions of Niger
Agadez Region
Diffa Region
Dosso Region
Maradi Region
Tahoua Region
Tillabéri Region
Zinder Region

The Regions are subdivided into Departments and communes. As of 2005, there were 36 départements, divided into 265 communes, 122 cantons and 81 groupements. The latter two categories cover all areas not covered by Urban Communes (population over 10000) or Rural Communes (population under 10000), and are governed by the Department, whereas Communes have (since 1999) elected councils and mayors.  Additional semi-autonomous sub-divisions include Sultanates, Provinces and Tributaries (tribus).  The Nigerien government estimates there are an additional 17000 Villages administered by Rural Communes, while there are a number of Quartiers (boroughs  or neighborhoods) administered by Urban Communes.

Restructuring
Prior to the devolution program on 1999–2006, these Regions were styled Departments.  Confusingly, the next level down (Arrondissements) were renamed Departments.

1992 division
Tillabéri department was created in 1992, when Niamey Region (then called "department") was split, with the area immediately outside Niamey renamed as the  capital district.

Historical evolution
Prior to independence, Niger was divided into sixteen Cercles as second level administration divisions: Agadez, Birni N'Konni, Dogondoutchi, Dosso, Filingué, Gouré, Madaoua, Magaria, Maradi, N'Guigmi, Niamey, Tahoua, Téra, Tessaoua, Tillabéry, and Zinder. Their capitals had the same names as the cercle.

After independence, the 31 December 1961 Law of territorial organization created 31 circonscriptions. The 16 colonial cercles continued to exist, and served as a level of division above these circonscriptions. Four cercles (Dogondoutchi, Filingué, N'Guigmi, and Téra) had only one circonscription. The Law of August 14, 1964 then reorganized the country into seven departments, adopting the French second level administration naming system, in contrast to neighbor Mali, which retained the colonial Cercles and Regions.

Nigel Hamilton (born 16 February 1944) is a British-born biographer, academic, and broadcaster, whose works have been translated into sixteen languages. In the United States, he is known primarily for his best-selling work on the young John F. Kennedy, JFK: Reckless Youth, which was made into an ABC miniseries. In the United Kingdom, he is known for Monty, a three-volume official life of Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, a senior military commander in World War II, which won both the 1981 Whitbread Award and the Templer Medal for Military History.

He has also written about the lives of Thomas Mann and former President Bill Clinton as well as numerous other works in a variety of fields.  His film on the life of Field Marshal Lord Montgomery won the New York Blue Ribbon Award for Best Documentary.  He founded the British Institute of Biography and became the first professor of biography in the UK at De Montfort University.  He is currently senior fellow at the John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy Studies, University of Massachusetts, Boston, where he wrote a modern version of The Twelve Caesars, titled American Caesars: Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush, published in September 2010 by Yale University Press.

Early life and career
Hamilton was born in Alnmouth, Northumberland, but spent his early life in London, where his father, Lt-Colonel Sir Denis Hamilton, a distinguished World War II battalion commander in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, became a pioneering editor of The Sunday Times, chairman and editor-in-chief of The Times, chairman of Reuters, and trustee of the British Museum and British Library. Hamilton was educated at Westminster School with his twin brother Adrian, who later became a prominent British journalist for the London Observer,  Times and Independent.

He then attended Munich University and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received an honours degree in history and a master's degree.  Subsequently, he trained under André Deutsch and Diana Athill as a book publisher at André Deutsch Publishers.  After leaving Deutsch, he taught at a school in Greenwich, where he assisted in reviving the historic borough on the River Thames. Hamilton opened a bookstore and began writing with his mother, Olive Hamilton, the first history of Greenwich in nearly a century, Royal Greenwich. He wrote several more guide books and edited the arts page in a London newspaper.

Biographer
After moving to Suffolk, Hamilton published his first major biography in 1978, The Brothers Mann, recording the lives of the German novelists Heinrich and Thomas Mann which received high praise in Britain and the United States and was translated into several languages.

In 1981, Hamilton published the first volume of his official life of Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, Monty: The Making of a General, 1887–1942, which established Hamilton's international reputation as a military historian and biographer.  This work was followed by Monty: Master of the Battlefield, 1942–1944, and Monty: The Field Marshal, 1944–1976.  The Making of a General won the Whitbread Award for Biography in 1981, and the Templer Medal for Best Contribution to Military History in 1986.

Working with Robin Whitby, a Cambridge colleague, in 1987, Hamilton founded Biografia Publishers and The Biography Bookshop in Covent Garden in Central London to promote the field of biography.

In 1988, Hamilton moved to the United States to undertake a book on the life of former President John F. Kennedy and he was named the John F. Kennedy Scholar at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and a visiting professor of history. The first volume of his biography was published by Random House in the autumn of 1992 as JFK: Reckless Youth.  The New York Times Book Review welcomed it as "rich, gripping... a book not only about a remarkable young John F. Kennedy but also about American democracy’s own still reckless age." It became a New York Times bestseller and film rights were sold to Hearst Entertainment, who turned it into a television mini-series, JFK: Reckless Youth, which starred Patrick Dempsey as the young Kennedy. The book was intended to be the first of a three-volume series on Kennedy, but following its publication, Hamilton "lost access to critical primary source documents and was forced to abandon the series."

In 1994, Hamilton moved back to the UK, where he became visiting professor of history at Royal Holloway, University of London, and Professor of Biography at De Montfort University, in Leicester. He set up the British Institute of Biography and led Royal Holloway's bid to create the first public and academic centre for biography in Britain, the Biorama Project.

Hamilton again returned to the United States to undertake a two-volume biographical work on the life of former president, Bill Clinton.  The first volume was published as Bill Clinton: An American Journey in 2003 while the second volume, Bill Clinton: Mastering the Presidency (taking Clinton's life up to 1996), followed in 2007. Both were lauded in the press and received outstanding reviews.

Having become senior fellow at the John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy Studies and a visiting scholar at both Georgetown University and George Washington University in 2005, Hamilton returned to his first love, the study of the art of biography. He published Biography: A Brief History in 2007, to high acclaim from The New York Times and followed in 2008 with How To Do Biography: A Primer, based on his many years of teaching and life writing, which received additional praise for Hamilton's work on the art of biography.

Hamilton followed with a modern version of the classic history of the great emperors of Rome, The Twelve Caesars, written early in the second century A.D. by the biographer and historian Suetonius.  Published by Yale University Press in September 2010, American Caesars records the lives of the last twelve American presidents, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to George W. Bush, and is Hamilton's most ambitious work to date.

Hamilton also reviews books for The Boston Sunday Globe, The Journal of Military History and the London Review of Books, among others. He has had op-ed pieces and articles in The New York Times, The Independent of London, and the Times Higher Education, among others. Hamilton has contributed to dozens of television documentary programmes and lectures at many universities around the world on his work.

Personal life
Hamilton was married to Hannelore Pfeifer, a doctoral student of German literature at Munich University, and had two children, Alexander and Sebastian. Following her death in 1973, Hamilton married Outi Palovesi in 1976 and together, they had two more children, Nick and Christian. In 2005, the marriage was dissolved and Hamilton married his third wife, Raynel Shepard, in 2006. Shepard is a curriculum developer in ESL for the Boston Public Schools and a university lecturer in education. Nigel Hamilton is a United States citizen.

Hazel McCallion  (February 14, 1921 – January 29, 2023) was a Canadian politician who served as the fifth mayor of Mississauga. First elected in November 1978, McCallion was mayor for 36 years until her retirement in 2014, making her the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. She was a successful candidate in twelve municipal elections, having been acclaimed twice and re-elected ten other times. Her supporters gave her the nickname "Hurricane Hazel" because of her outspoken political style with reference to the hurricane of 1954, which had a considerable impact. When the 1979 Mississauga train derailment occurred early in her tenure, she helped oversee evacuation of 200,000 residents from the resulting explosion, fire, and spill of hazardous chemicals.

Before marriage, McCallion played professional women's ice hockey while attending school in Montreal, then worked for engineering firm Canadian Kellogg, and was transferred to Toronto in 1942. She moved to Streetsville in 1951, and left the business world in 1967 to pursue politics. She served as mayor of Streetsville from 1970 to 1973, prior to its amalgamation into Mississauga. Following her tenure as mayor of Mississauga, McCallion remained an active public figure, serving as the first chancellor of Sheridan College, on the Greater Toronto Airport Authority board, and as a special advisor to the Ontario government.

McCallion received multiple honours including the Order of Canada in 2005, the Order of Ontario in 2020, the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012, and honorary doctorate of law degrees from the University of Toronto, and Ryerson University. She died at 101, and was given a state funeral on what would have been her 102nd birthday.

Early life and career
Hazel Journeaux was born on February 14, 1921, in Port Daniel, on the Gaspé Coast of Quebec. Her father, Herbert Armand Journeaux (1879–1944), owned a fishing and canning company. Her mother, Amanda Maude Travers (1876–1955), was a homemaker and ran the family farm. The family included two older sisters and two older brothers. After graduating from Quebec High School, she attended business secretarial school in Quebec City and Montreal.

Journeaux began playing ice hockey in the late 1920s in Port Daniel with her two sisters, and was a forward on their team. She then joined a professional women's hockey team while attending school in Montreal, receiving $5 per game. The team was sponsored by Kik Cola and was part of a three-team women's league. She wanted to attend university, but her family could not afford it. After beginning her career in Montreal with the Canadian division of engineering firm Kellogg, she was transferred to Toronto in 1942, where she helped set up the local office. She left the business world in 1967 to devote her life to a career in politics.

Political career

Early years

McCallion began her political career in Streetsville (now part of Mississauga). Her first campaign was in 1964 for the position of deputy reeve. It was unsuccessful, and she later considered herself to be a victim of "dirty tricks". Having later been appointed the chairman of the Streetsville Planning Board, she was elected as deputy reeve in the 1967 election and was appointed reeve in 1968. She was elected as Streetsville's mayor in 1970, serving until 1973. 

The Town of Streetsville was amalgamated with the Town of Mississauga and the Town of Port Credit to form the City of Mississauga at the beginning of 1974; McCallion advocated unsuccessfully to preserve Streetsville as a separate municipality. In the same year she was elected to the Mississauga City Council, and retained her seat on the council by acclamation in the 1976 municipal election. By the time she was elected mayor of Mississauga, she had sat on virtually every committee in Peel Region and the City of Mississauga. She had also served on the executive of many federal and provincial committees and associations.

Mayor of Mississauga
McCallion was first elected mayor in 1978, defeating popular incumbent Ron Searle by about 3,000 votes. She had been in office only a few months when the 1979 Mississauga train derailment occurred, in which a Canadian Pacific train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in a heavily populated area near Mavis Road. A large explosion and fire ensued as hazardous chemicals spilled. McCallion, along with the Peel Regional Police and other governmental authorities, oversaw the evacuation of the city. There were no deaths or serious injuries during the week-long emergency, and Mississauga gained renown for the successful evacuation of its then 200,000 residents.

During McCallion's terms in office, Mississauga grew from a small collection of towns and villages to one of Canada's largest cities, with much of the growth occurring after the 1976 election of René Lévesque's Parti Québécois government sparked an exodus of Anglophones and corporations from Montreal to the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The high rate of low-density growth led to McCallion being nicknamed "Queen of Sprawl" by urban planning critics.

McCallion was easily re-elected throughout her tenure as mayor, with no serious challengers coming close to unseating her. She received more than 90% of the votes at the 1997, 2000 and 2003 mayoral elections. She never campaigned during elections and refused to accept political donations, instead asking her supporters to donate the money to charity. Her final term as mayor, won in the election of October 2010, was her twelfth consecutive term. She announced during her final term that she would not be running for re-election in the 2014 municipal elections and endorsed councillor and former federal member of Parliament Bonnie Crombie to replace her as Mayor. Crombie defeated former city councillor, member of Provincial Parliament and federal cabinet minister Steve Mahoney to win the 2014 municipal election.

In 2012, McCallion was the third-highest paid mayor in Canada, with a salary of $187,057.

In a first-person account for Canadian magazine Confidence Bound, McCallion credited her faith with giving her energy, and said she still did her own household chores. "Housework and gardening are great forms of exercise and keep one humble."

On her 90th birthday in 2011, McCallion was assessed by Dr. Barbara Clive, a geriatrician, who stated that "at 90 her gait is perfect, her speech is totally sharp and she has the drive to still run this city. She's the poster child for seniors".

Conflict of interest allegations
In 1982, McCallion was found guilty of a conflict of interest on a planning decision by the Ontario High Court of Justice due to not absenting herself from a council meeting on a matter in which she had an interest. In 1983, The Municipal Conflict of Interest Act would have required her to vacate her seat and prohibited her from running for the following term.

In 2009, McCallion was the focus of public opinion when it was alleged that she failed to disclose a conflict of interest when attending meetings that concerned her son's company, World Class Developments Ltd. On October 3, 2011, Judge Douglas Cunningham found McCallion "acted in a 'real and apparent conflict of interest' while pushing hard for a real estate deal that could have put millions of dollars in her son's pocket." On June 14, 2013, charges under the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act were dismissed as World Class Developments did not have a financial interest as defined under the Act, and the application was also statute-barred. In a later ruling concerning costs, Judge J. Sproat said, "Out of seven major issues, Mayor McCallion was successful on only three. On two of the three issues Mayor McCallion was successful, not because of any prudence or diligence, but only because World Class Developments's project had not progressed at a faster pace."

Political views
While party preferences are not usually expressed in Canadian municipal politics, McCallion supported the Liberal Party at the federal and provincial levels, and was asked in 1982 to consider running for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party. She endorsed Kathleen Wynne on the convention floor of the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election, and later endorsed her and her party in the 2014 Ontario general election. Otherwise, McCallion was sometimes described as a small-c conservative. McCallion endorsed Liberal leader Justin Trudeau for the 2015 election. She also appeared in a notable television advertisement for the federal Liberals during the final days of the 2015 election. In the 2018 Ontario provincial election, McCallion endorsed PC leader Doug Ford, who went on to become Premier of Ontario.

In 2007, McCallion responded to the federal government's refusal to give any of the Canadian goods and services tax to cities, a funding source long requested by many municipalities across Canada, by planning a five percent surcharge on property taxes in the city. She was able to have the levy introduced and approved on the same day by Mississauga City council. Most media coverage, as well as Toronto mayor David Miller, noted that McCallion was arguably one of the few mayors in the country with the political capital to implement such a strategy.

McCallion was one of the first Canadian politicians to openly support the creation of a Palestinian state. Addressing the annual convention of the Canadian Arab Federation in 1983, she argued that Palestinian issues had been distorted by the national media and was quoted as saying, "The Palestinians need and require and deserve a country of their own. Why shouldn't they get it?"

Achievements
McCallion established the GTA Mayors' Committee in 1992. She brought together the 30 mayors, later adding the chair of Metropolitan Toronto and the four regional chairs to work cooperatively for the economic promotion of the GTA. From 1992 to January 2000, the committee, chaired by McCallion, was a strong voice on key issues affecting the future of the GTA. She was a founder and honorary co-chair of the Greater Toronto Marketing Alliance.

In 1996, McCallion was appointed to the "Who Does What" panel. She was also appointed to two sub-panels: Assessment and Property Taxation Reform, and Emergency Services. She represented the Association of Municipalities of Ontario on the Electricity Transition Committee for the Ministry of Electricity, Science and Technology.

McCallion is the first woman to hold such significant positions as president of the Streetsville and District Chamber of Commerce, president of the Anglican Young Peoples' Association of Canada, mayor of Streetsville, and mayor of Mississauga. She was responsible for the formation of Hazel's Hope, a campaign to fund health care for children afflicted with AIDS and HIV in southern Africa.

McCallion hosted an annual gala in Mississauga to raise money for arts and culture in the city.

Ice hockey
At the 1987 World Women's Hockey Tournament, the championship trophy was named the Hazel McCallion World Cup. McCallion was once a board member of the Central Ontario Women's Hockey League, and was instrumental in the construction of the Hershey Centre in Mississauga. She provided assistance to Don Cherry's group to bring an Ontario Hockey League franchise to the city in 1998, and she was instrumental in bringing the IIHF Women's World Hockey Championships to the city in 2000.

Post-political career

In November 2015, McCallion was appointed chief elder officer (CEO) of Revera Inc., to provide advice and counsel to the senior living sector company.

In September 2011, Sheridan College opened the doors to its Hazel McCallion Campus in Mississauga, which was greatly expanded in 2018, more than doubling its enrollment. Furthering her ties with the college, in 2016, McCallion was named Sheridan's first chancellor, as part of its bid to attain university status. In February 2015, McCallion became a special advisor to the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM), the Mississauga campus of the University of Toronto, providing advice on matters related to strategic development of the school.

In 2017 McCallion was appointed to the board of the Greater Toronto Airport Authority, a position for which she accepted a three-year renewal in April 2022. In January 2019, Ontario Premier Doug Ford appointed McCallion as a special adviser. She soon after said she wanted more details before accepting or declining, but later decided to decline the job offer. In October 2022, McCallion was appointed the head of the Greenbelt Council advisory group by Premier Ford. In January 2023, she endorsed his plan to take protected areas out of the Greenbelt for housing development, calling it "brave".

Personal life
Journeaux met her future husband, Sam McCallion (1923–1997), at an Anglican Church congregation in Toronto in 1951; they married on September 29 of that year. As a marriage present from McCallion's in-laws, a piece of land near the village of Streetsville was given to the newlyweds, to which they moved in December 1951. The couple had three children, and were married until Sam McCallion's death from Alzheimer's disease in 1997. Their son Peter unsuccessfully ran for Mississauga Ward 9 councillor in the 2022 municipal election.

As a volunteer, McCallion also served as president of the Anglican Young People's Association of Canada, and later provided leadership as a district commissioner with the Girl Guides of Canada in the early 1960s. Before entering politics, she and her husband founded The Streetsville Booster in 1964.

Death and state funeral
McCallion died from pancreatic cancer at home on January 29, 2023, at age 101. A state funeral was held for McCallion on February 14, 2023, on what would have been her 102nd birthday. Her body lay in repose at Mississauga Civic Centre for two days, prior to her funeral at the Paramount Fine Foods Centre. Dignitaries attending the funeral included prime minister Justin Trudeau, former prime minister Jean Chrétien, and Ontario premier Doug Ford.

Anthony John Parry (8 September 1945 – 23 November 2009) was an English footballer who made nearly 200 appearances in the Football League playing as a central defender for Hartlepool United, Derby County and Mansfield Town.

Parry was born in Burton upon Trent.  He was Brian Clough's first signing as manager of Hartlepool. He was a mainstay of the side which won promotion from the Fourth Division in the 1967–68 season, and won the club's inaugural Player of the Year award.

In 1972 the club was on the brink of going out of business, needing to sell a player to survive, when Clough, by then manager of Derby County, bid £2,500 for the player. It is usually regarded as a philanthropic gesture by Clough (albeit using Derby's money) as Parry made few appearances for Derby before moving on to Mansfield Town.

He later played non-league football for Gresley Rovers, where he was Player of the Year in the 1982–83 season.

In February 2009, Parry made a triumphant return to the North East as guest of honour at Hartlepool United's centenary dinner. Barry Butlin, Secretary & Treasurer of Derby County Former Players' Association, said: "It is fitting that Tony's fans at Hartlepool and in the North East had the opportunity to honour him at the 'Centenary' celebrations, and Tony was delighted to be greeted by his telly idol Jeff Stelling."

Parry died suddenly on 23 November 2009, following a short battle with pneumonia.

Demography

Arikkulath Nambi, a vassal of Zamorin of calicut is said to have held sway over this area.
Its history is shrouded in mystery.  though attempts have been made to write the history of Arikkulam, nothing fruitful emerged from them.  In this connection, a seminar was held at the
Arikkulam panchayat office a year ago in which noted academics like Pavithran master and Dinesan of Naderi participated. Will Arikkulam give us a savant who will unravel its past?

There is also a derived fable that the village of Arikkulam was initially called as "Harikulam", "Hari" meaning Lord Vishnu and "kulam" meaning pool together meaning "Lord Vishnu's pool". This may be the reason why the village has a temple devoted the formerly mentioned lord "Areekkunnath Vishnu Temple". Another local temple of this area is the "Oravingal Bhagavathi temple".

Plot
Ferdinand Bauer lives with his wife Juliette on a farm on a hill with their adoptive son (actually his grandson), Tom.  The film begins when they agree to care of Lili, his other granddaughter, whom they will look after while Lili's parents travel by car and trailer to Africa to find crocodiles for their zoo, which they also leave in the care of Ferdinand and Juliette.

On the farm, there is a small pond. The frogs in the pond are restless, as their calculations have shown that the Earth is about to be flooded for forty days and forty nights. The frogs initially are reluctant to tell them, since they cannot change anything but decide to tell Tom and Lili, so that they can warn people.

Suddenly the flood starts, apparently washing away all live on Earth. The zoo animals escape to the barn which is on top of a hill, the foundations of the building are torn away by the flood and floats on a huge tractor tire on the water. Ferdinand, an experienced sailor, takes on the role of the captain and every one agrees that they will only survive if they stick together. When the rains finally stop all the animals are very hungry. Ferdinand has stored 28 tons of potatoes which he uses to make French fries, but the carnivores are unhappy because they cannot survive only on French fries but Ferdinand convinces the carnivores to yield in view of the greater good of everyone on the floating barn.

A tortoise appears, injured by a crocodile attack and has lost a leg. Lili befriends the tortoise and Tom notices that she has kept her distance from him ever since. The fox and the lion grudge about their lot of having to feed on potatoes when a voice tells them that they should raise against such decision but the lion prevails in that they should respect the captain's law, however after a few days their huger gets the best of them and they attack a sheep and Ferdinand vanishes the carnivores to a bathing tub that floats behind the barn. In the meantime, Ferdinand and Tom talk about his father, who was the machinist at Ferdinand's boat, who was very handy with them. Ferdinand manages to "motorize" the barn by modifying an old tractor engine to oars at the side of the building.

The tortoise tells Lili her story of how she saved her life and three of her eggs despite losing her limb to the crocodiles, who attacked everyone, including humans, at the time of the flood and convinces Lili that her parents died. Ferdinand and Juliette adopt Lili as their own. At night the carnivores notice that the tortoise is actually in cahoots with the crocodiles to feed the entire barn to them, but she must get rid of the captain. The carnivores are initially unconvinced, but they latter agree to mutiny and in the ensuing fight they throw Ferdinand off the board in a barrel and Juliette jumps off after him. The rest of the animals and the children are locked away at the bottom of the barn. Lili sees now that she fell into the tortoise's trap, who had told her that she would not be her friend if she continued being friends with Tom.

The children and the animals hear a commotion upstairs, which is the result of the carnivores feeding on the poultry, so the children decide to climb on the giraffe's neck, but are overcome by the others. The tortoise convinces most of the carnivores to eat the children next, only the lion and one of the cats are reluctant to do it, but the majority decision is that they are next. The tortoise explains that she is taking revenge on humans because they have pursued and killed her family and her kind for their flesh, eggs and to make luxury items with their carapace, telling the children that the eggs that she keeps in her carapace are not her own but the crocodiles' who believe that the humans had eaten them and thus prompting the attacks on them. Meanwhile, one of the cats convinces the other to help the children, since humans had taken them in when they had no home and if this senseless flesh-eating frenzy continues, there is no guarantee that the kittens inside her womb will be safe.
 
The tortoise signals the crocodiles to start the attack, the cat frees the children who manage to start the tractor engine and escape from the crocodiles, who are in pursuit of the barn. In the meantime Ferdinand finally manages to wake up and sees that the barn is coming at them at full speed. The tortoise finally manages to break the engine down and the barn seems finally at the mercy of the crocodiles, but the elephants manage to rip the carapace off the tortoise and everyone sees that it is not a female but a male, therefore the eggs cannot be his. As the tortoise is trying to explain his way out the situation, the eggs hatch and out of them come little crocodiles, proving the case against the tortoise. The tortoise is at the mercy of the angry animals who are about to throw him off to the crocodiles, but Ferdinand arrives at the last minute and berates everyone for their violent conduct. He resumes his command as captain, crocodiles leave after acknowledging that they were duped by the tortoise, who remains caparaceless in the barn.

A few days go by and the kittens are born. The general happiness is interrupted when the elephants, who have been unable to move during all their time in the barn, appear at the door to congratulate the proud mother. Ferdinand walks out of the barn and sees that the water has finally gone and that dryland is finally there. There is a lot of mist and as it lifts, all the people and animals at the barn see that there are more boats on the top of other mountains and that there are many survivors. Later that night all celebrate but a huge light interrupts the festivities, it is a large car driven by Lili's parents, who tell the rest that the flood did not take place in Africa.

Life
Williams was born on 24 June 1931, at the General Hospital in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago and grew up in Nepal Street, St. James. He was initiated as a player of the steelpan in the band, "Five Graves to Cairo" of Carlton Street, St. James. At the age of 12, he played with Harlem Nightingale Steelband, for the first street Carnival, which was held after World War II.

Williams went on to become the leading Ping Pong player in the band Sun Valleyians, which comprised a group of teenagers and grew to become the legendary steel orchestra, Sun Valley.

Friderich Adolph von Schleppegrell (28 June 1792 – 25 July 1850) was a Dano-Norwegian military officer.

Son of Lieutenant-Colonel Otto Heinrich von Schleppegrell (1729-1808) and Cathrine Abigael Zimmer (1750-1836), he was born in Brunlanes. He became a military officer in 1807, and took part in the Gunboat War for Denmark-Norway. When Norway became independent of Denmark, only to enter a personal union with Sweden in November 1814, Schleppegrell changed his allegiance to Denmark.

By 1848 he had been promoted to Major General. The same year, the First Schleswig War broke out. Schleppegrell excelled in the battles of Nybøl, Dybbøl and Fredericia, but fell on 25 July 1850 following the battle of Isted. He was buried in Flensborg. The memorial Isted Lion is partly dedicated to Schleppegrell.
The yellowback fusilier (Caesio xanthonota) is a  pelagic marine ray-finned fish, a fusilier belonging to the family Caesionidae. It is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific, being found in shallow water from the East African coast to Indonesia.

Taxonomy
The yellowback fusilier was first formally described in 1853 by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker with the type locality given as Batavia on Java. This species has been placed in the subgenus Flavicaesio. The specific name xanthonota  is a compunction of xantho meaning “yellow” and nota meaning “back”, a reference to the yellow upperparts of this species.

Description
The yellowback fusilier is a small to medium-sized fish which grows to about  long. The mouth is small and terminal and is protusible, being able to be extended forward to swallow food. The body is fusiform or spindle-shaped. The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 14-15 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and 11 or 12 soft rays. The caudal fin is deeply forked.

The body coloration is greyish blue with a bright yellow zone on the back. The yellow area goes from the forehead, between the eyes, to the tail, and includes the dorsal fin and the caudal fin. This area corresponds more or less to the upper third of the body. The belly is plain white.

Distribution and habitat
Caesio xanthonota is widely distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf excluded, to Indonesia in the western Pacific Ocean.It lives in mid-water in deep lagoons and close to external reefs from the surfaceto 50 m deep.

Diet
It feeds on zooplankton, so it is a planktivore.

Behaviour
The yellowback fusilier is diurnal, and lives in groups and forms schools with other caesionids such as Caesio teres.

Him is a 1995 play written by actor Christopher Walken, who also took the lead role, and which debuted in the New York Shakespeare Festival. It revolved around the afterlife of Elvis Presley, the singer who, as Walken himself turned 15, became his first idol. The play, Walken's first venture into playwriting, adopts a surreal tone, and is replete with references to aspects of Presley's life, as well as to other pieces of theatre, including Hamlet and those of Tennessee Williams. While it enjoyed some positive comments, it was largely panned by the critics.

Cast
 Christopher Walken - Him/Her
 Rob Campbell - Rob
 Larry Block - Doc/Borden/Taxman/Stylagi
 Barton Heyman - Joe/Mel
 Peter Appel - Al/Disappointed Fan/Stylagi
 Ellen McElduff - Nurse/Dolores/Journalist

Synopsis

Taking place in an "unspecified present", Him depicts Presley (Walken), now deceased and in the afterlife (specifically, limbo, which is filled with Elvis look-a-likes), growing discontented with the antics of his twin brother, Rob (Campbell), who was stillborn many years previously. Rob is responsible for the numerous Elvis sightings taking place, often showing up as a ghost on Earth to fool people into believing that Presley was still alive. Presley relives his death, expressing annoyance at the decision of doctors to terminate life support. He continues to commentate through several surreal scenes, including a segment where a foam-likeness of Presley is tossed around the stage, and when four men dressed in underwear mourn at Presley's graveside. The plot continues, re-telling Presley's death as a disappearing act which enabled Presley to flee to Morocco for a sex change operation to become "her". A truck driver (Heyman) who recognises Presley, now a waitress at a "truckstop", as the aged rock-star, narrates this segment while wrestling with feelings of sympathy and sexual desire.

Music
Walken does not utilize many impressions of Presley other than clothing and hair style, instead singing in his own voice, with an occasional "Tennessee Williams-style" accent. Musical Direction and Sound Design was done by Mike Nolan, who led the band, "Organ Donor." The band played the show live every night in the stage right orchestra pit. The original music, written by Mike Nolan and Scott Williams, was contemporary to the audience rather than to Presley.
 Mike Nolan - Guitar, Pedal Steel Guitar
 Scott Williams - Bass
 Annie Gosfield - Organ, Sampler, Synthesizer
 Michael Evans - Drums and Percussion

Artistry
The main poster for the play consisted of the idiosyncratic Presley hair-style set against a yellow background, with 'HIM' in large, pink lettering in the center. Walken requested such imagery, as it was his main physical impression of Presley. Walken himself spends a large amount of time during the play in a green velvet jumpsuit and a cape as he plays Presley, aside from the end scenes as the waitress where he dresses in "female garb".

Performances

The play was deemed as a "workshop" and ran for three weeks of previews followed by thirteen performances. It ran for 75 minutes at each showing, with no intermissions.

Reception

A review by Michael Feingold stated that "You [Walken] write good strong sentences - not true of every actor who takes up playwriting - and your reflections on the strange state we call celebrity in America aren't foolish. But you haven't written a play yet. Disjointed as modern art has been, loose remarks, anecdotes, and routines around a theme still don't add up to a dramatic form." Other critics agreed on Walken's performance as "strange and rambling" or a "farrago of nonsense" while critics Thomas Hischak and Gerald Bordman identified it as the oddest play in New York that year.

The New York Times, however, gave a more positive review of "Christopher Walken's woozily conceived, fantastical new play... In the sharpness and wit of the writing and in the performances by Mr. Walken and Mr. Heyman, this sequence gives you some idea of what the rest of "Him" might have been." The New York Times does not, however, give a totally positive review, as it also states that the play "begins with a certain amount of dizzy promise and ends, approximately 75 minutes later, with the only sequence in the play that comes close to realizing it. In between, "Him" is cluttered with murky thoughts expressed in windy speeches, illustrated by anecdotes that have no point, though the general idea seems not to be a foolish one."

The New Yorker writes that "When he [Walken] dons Elvis's cape, he seems ready to take flight." However the New York Magazine theatre critic, John Simon, referred to it as "garbage" and "maudlin masturbation". He describes Walken's performance as self-indulgent and scornful.

After defeating the insurgency led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in 1971, the Sri Lanka Armed Forces were confronted with a new conflict, this time with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and other Tamil militant groups. The war escalated to the point where India was asked to intervene as a peacekeeping force. This was later seen as a tactical error, as the IPKF united nationalist elements such as the JVP to politically support the LTTE in their call to evict the IPKF. The war with the LTTE was halted following the signing of a ceasefire agreement in 2002 with the help of international mediation. However, renewed violence broke out in December 2005 and following the collapse of peace talks, the army has been involved in the heavy fighting that has resumed in the north and east of the country.

Since 1980 the army has undertaken many operations against the LTTE rebels. The major operations conducted by the army eventually lead to the capture of Jaffna and other rebel strongholds.

Winners
The Living Room EP is the debut album from the American rock band the Seldon Plan.

Content
The seven-track indie pop rock album was released on compact disc and digital download with The Beechfields Record Label, on July 31, 2003. It was recorded by Frank Marchand in June of that year, at Waterford Digital in Pasadena, Maryland, with production by Marchand and the Seldon Plan. The songs on The Living Room EP are loosely stitched together, and it contains lush sounds, and scraped, distorted guitars. It draws comparison to the music of artists on the independent record label Deep Elm Records, the indie rock band Unrest, and the alternative rock band Tsunami, and the vocals are likened to the new wave band Tears for Fears vocalist, Roland Orzabal.

A review from AllMusic says "though promising, the Seldon Plan's debut is a bit odd. The Baltimore quartet [...] seems intent on crafting a mature indie pop sound [that] continues tingeing instrumentally toward a slightly angular, emo-influenced sound."

Chandradhar Sharma Guleri (7 July 1883 – 11 September 1922) was a writer and scholar of Hindi, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Pali from Jaipur, India. He was born in Jaipur and his father belongs to Guler village in Himachal Pradesh hence "Guleri" at the end of the name (as a tribute to his point of origin). Described as a versatile genius, he is known as the author of Usne Kaha Tha (Hindi: उसने कहा था), first published in 1915, which is debated to be the first short story in Hindi. He is also remembered for his efforts to preserve the Jantar Mantar Observatory in Jaipur.

Career

Pandit Guleri graduated from Allahabad University and later headed the Department of Sanskrit at Mayo College, Ajmer. In 1922, he was appointed to the Manindra Chandra Nandi Chair in Ancient History and Religion at Banaras Hindu University.

Film adaptation of Usne Kaha Tha
The story Usne Kaha Tha was brought to the big screen in 1960 with the same name. Produced by Bimal Roy, the film starred Sunil Dutt and Nanda and directed by Moni Bhattacharjee.
Osteoblast milk protein (OMP) is the name used by Mengniu, a Chinese dairy company, for a milk protein used as a food additive in their Milk Deluxe since 2005. It is supposed to help the absorption of calcium and promote bone growth in the osteoblasts and prevent osteoporosis.

In February 2009, the safety of OMP was questioned by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), national quality supervision department in China, when they were doing a general clean-up on the use of food additives after the 2008 Chinese milk scandal where melamine was found in some milk products. Mengniu stopped adding OMP to its milk on February 2 after a government order, but did not recall products already on the market. On February 13 the Ministry of Health stated that OMP is "not harmful to human health", but the ban on its use stayed in place because the importer had not submitted the necessary paperwork.

The raw ingredients for OMP were imported from the Tatua Co-operative Dairy Company in New Zealand via Shanghai Tongyuan Food Technology Co. Ltd.. Mengniu first stated that the major active ingredient in OMP is Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), but later denied adding IGF-1 and said that OMP is the same as Milk Basic Protein (MBP). IGF-1 could possibly cause cancer in extreme doses. The company claimed that the additive is widely used in Europe, the United States and Japan, and had been certified by the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However it turned out that the FDA letter referred to a perhaps different additive used by the Japanese Snow Brand Milk Products Company. A director of the Guangdong Dairy Industry Association said that OMP is seldom used in milk products overseas and no conclusion about the impact of OMP on human health has been proven globally. The association may contest any official declaration from the Ministry of Health that OMP is safe.

According to Mengniu and the Ministry of Health, OMP is made from milk by degreasing by skimming and membrane filtration and its major components are lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase.

Francis Schulte was born on December 23, 1926, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of John Schulte, a pharmacist, and his wife, Katherine (née Bible) Schulte. His parents had him baptized with both their surnames. As a child, his parents enrolled him at Norwood Academy for Boys in Philadelphia. Schulte then studied at St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia.

Deciding to become a priest, with his mother's strong support, Schulte enrolled at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, Pennsylvania. He later studied at the University of Pennsylvania, obtaining a Master of Political Science.  Schulte then did more graduate studies at Oxford University in England, and at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Priesthood 
Schulte was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal John Francis O’Hara on May 10, 1952, for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.  After his ordination, Schulte was named by Archbishop John F. O'Hara to serve as a faculty member and department head of various Philadelphia-area parochial schools.

Archbishop John Krol appointed Schulte as an assistant superintendent of the archdiocesan schools in 1960.  He became superintendent of the schools in 1970. Schulte was raised to the rank of papal chamberlain by Pope Paul VI, and was named pastor of St. Margaret Parish in Narberth, Pennsylvania, in 1980.

Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia 
On June 27, 1981, Schulte was appointed an auxiliary bishop of his archdiocese and the titular Bishop of Afufenia by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated on August 12, 1981, with Cardinal Krol as his principal consecrator and Bishops John J. Graham and Martin N. Lohmuller serving as co-consecrators.

Bishop of Wheeling-Charleston 
On June 4, 1985, John Paul II named Schulte as the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston.

Archbishop of New Orleans 
John Paul II appointed Schulte as the twelfth archbishop of the Archdiocese of New Orleans on December 6, 1988; he was installed on February 14, 1989. Population shifts in the archdiocese forced Schulte to close or merge several parishes. He also restructured the school system of the archdiocese.

Schulte served as the chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Education, helping to write and research a document on the role local bishops and archbishops should play in Catholic universities within their jurisdictions. In 1992, he created the archdiocese's first formal process for dealing with complaints of sexual abuse by priests or other church employees. In addition to Schulte's duties in the archdiocese, in 1992 he also took on the leadership of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre for the Southeastern United States, being named the grand prior of that region.

Retirement 
On January 3, 2002. John Paul II accepted Schulte's resignation as archbishop of New Orleans. After being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2005, his doctors suggested he move to Philadelphia for treatment as New Orleans was dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

After spending time in a nursing home in Philadelphia, Francis Schulte died there on January 17, 2016,at age 89. His remains were interred in the crypt of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, King of France in New Orleans.
Lathraeodiscus is a genus of fungi in the family Pyronemataceae. It is monotypic, containing the single species Lathraeodiscus arcticus. This species has been found in the lowland high-arctic areas of Greenland and in Svalbard, Norway.
TB9Cs1H3 is a member of the H/ACA-like class of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule that guide the sites of modification of uridines to pseudouridines of substrate RNAs. It is known as a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) thus named because of its cellular localization in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell.  TB9Cs1H3 is predicted to guide the pseudouridylation of LSU5 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at residue Ψ1250.
Richard Harland is an Australian fantasy and science fiction writer, academic, and performance artist, living in New South Wales, Australia. He was born in Huddersfield, United Kingdom and migrated to Australia in 1970. Throughout his authorship career, he has published 17 full-length works of fiction, three academic books, short stories and poems.

He is best known for his Eddon and Vail science fiction thriller series, the illustrated Wolf Kingdom series for children and three YA steampunk fantasies: Worldshaker, Liberator and Song of the Slums. He has been awarded the Australian Aurealis Award on six occasions for his fiction.

Life and academic career
Harland completed undergraduate studies for the English major at Cambridge University, and later graduated with a BA. After he earned his Bachelor's degree, he planned an ambitious doctoral thesis that would focus on a global theory of poetry language, and approached numerous universities around the globe seeking funding for his research. 

Support was unforthcoming until an offer from the University of Newcastle in New South Wales. He migrated to Australia in 1970 to take advantage of this opportunity. He originally only intended to remain in the country until his PhD was completed, but after some months decided to settle permanently.

Work on his thesis was slow, and he eventually reduced its scope to an MA. For several years, he eventually moved away from his studies, as he worked as a singer, songwriter and poet around Sydney. He published poetry and short stories during this period in a number of literary magazines. He returned to academic life in the 1980s through a tutoring position at the University of New South Wales and continued work on his doctoral thesis, which was published by Methuen (UK) as Superstructuralism: The Philosophy of Structuralism and Post-Structuralism in 1987. The volume sold well, was received well, and secured him a lecturing position in English at the University of Wollongong. Other academic books he published are Beyond Superstructuralism: The Syntagmatic Side of Language (Routledge, UK) and Literary Theory from Plato to Barthes (Macmillan, UK). He taught at (the University of) Wollongong for ten years before resigning to become a full-time fiction writer.

Fiction writing
He scored an early success in childhood with a short story that won a prominent United Kingdom competition. He also wrote and distributed stories while at school, exchanging ongoing installments for sweets and other tokens, when other pupils were reluctant to part with legal tender.

He is best known for several series of novels, but commenced his novel writing career relatively late in life. He had been eager to write full length tales from late childhood but suffered from writer's block, which prevented him making significant headway with novel projects (and also many short stories) for much of the next 25 years. He once attributed his writer's block partly to his belief that he had to write serious literary novels rather than what he found most enjoyable to work on. It was not until writing the comic horror novel The Vicar of Morbing Vyle (1993) that he managed to conquer this obstacle. However he had published short stories prior to this, some of which (along with poetry) were collected in Testimony (1981).

He was still lecturing at Wollongong when he wrote The Dark Edge, the first instalment in the Eddon and Vail series. His senior lecturing role was a secure tenured position, much sought after by other professional scholars. However, with his publisher Pan Macmillan Australia's commission of a sequel to The Dark Edge for the next year, he could not meet the demands of full-time academic life while writing fiction. Despite an uncertain future in a small Australian publication market—where books with relatively low volume sales were considered best-sellers and there were few full-time writers—he resigned from his academic role in 1997 to concentrate on his fiction. He has written full-time since. For many more years, he remained an Honorary Senior Fellow in English at Wollongong, and also taught summer courses on YA fantasy fiction there.

Novels
Many of Harland's novels contain maps. He has confessed to a fascination with maps: he states that he sometimes spends hours studying them. He has also admitted to often viewing his fictional worlds as though seen from an elevated distance, something he feels is a common feature among fantasy writers.

From the 1999 release of Hidden from View, the final volume to his Eddon and Vail series, every novel has been written either for young adults or children, with the exception of The Black Crusade (2004). Some of his novels have also been adapted into audiobooks.

The Vicar series
The first volume, The Vicar of Morbing Vyle, was Harland's first published novel. When Karl Evans Publishing started distributing the book, he approached individual booksellers in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney to promote it. Although out of print, it has since attained a cult status, something he claims was his original hope and dream when marketing the book.

The Black Crusade, a prequel to The Vicar of Morbing Vyle, was released 11 years later in 2004. It describes the journey of the hapless Basil Smorta, a multi lingual bank clerk, who is forced into the company of a group of "fundamental Darwinists" because they've imprisoned the object of his undying love, an Australian singer Volusia, in a mobile iron box. The group travel across Eastern Europe during 1894, and encounter ghosts, blood donating vampires and other comic horror curiosities. The novel shows the origin of the 'vyle' principle, which has descended from the Marquis of Morbol Villica to the Vicar in the first volume in the series. The Black Crusade plays with the notion of the tale's reliability as a factual narrative, including fictional footnotes apparently inserted by the book's publishers, who deplore Basil's actions and despise his unheroic qualities.

The novel was published by Chimaera Publications, which also produces Aurealis, a magazine which publishes and promotes Australian speculative fiction, and originated the Aurealis Awards (although these awards have been administered entirely independently from Chimaera by another organisation since 2004). The novel won an Aurealis Award in both the "Best Horror Novel" and the overarching "Golden Aurealis Best Novel" categories.

The Eddon and Vail series
In this series of three science fiction novels, there are both detective mystery elements and supernatural elements. Inspector Eddon Brac, a male detective with traditional sleuth leanings, is partnered with assistant Vail ev Vessintor, a goth woman aristocrat with expertise in the psychic sciences. Each novel explores the tension between the pair as they confront murder mysteries of unorthodox and surprising origin.

The series is set against the background of the planet Terra's colonial hegemony: its influence has spread across the cosmos, but is increasingly threatened by the Anti-Human, an unknown menace. The Anti-Human follows a steady path from the boundaries of the universe towards the core, consuming Terran colonies as it advances.
 
The first volume, The Dark Edge was a finalist for the 1997 Aurealis Award in both the "Horror Novel" and" Science Fiction Novel" categories. The third volume, Hidden from View, was nominated for the 1999 Ditmar Award in the Best Novel category.

The Heaven and Earth trilogy
This trilogy for young adults is set in Australia 1000 years into the future, and concerns a war between heaven and Earth. Each book includes an 'angelology'.

In preparation for writing the trilogy, Harland extensively researched angels and cosmology, including both the mainstream and unorthodox sources of Christian, Islamic and Judaic lore on the subjects. He was particularly concerned to present angels as awe inspiring, beautiful and numinous beings. He liked to have angels possess personalities that allow for the reader to empathise, yet be far removed from 'Disney-fied' images of sweetness-and-light. The first book he read on angels was A Dictionary of Angels by American poet Gustav Davidson. He returned to this book numerous times since to help with inspiration for all the books in the trilogy. He has also stated that the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck greatly assisted in creating his vision of heaven.

The Wolf Kingdom series

The series comprises four illustrated fantasy books. They are aimed at older pre-adolescents, commencing with Escape! and completed by The Heavy Crown, all published in 2008. Harland wrote the story, and Laura Peterson provided (mostly full page) illustrations for each chapter. Each tale functions as a self-contained narrative, but the series also interlinks as a larger story arc.

The books were launched in association with the Children's Book Council of Australia.

A race of talking, bipedal wolves have overrun and enslaved humankind, leaving only a determined resistance, known as the "Free Folk", who shelter in a subterranean refuge and plot to liberate themselves from their overlords. The revelation unfolded over the larger story arc turns upon the mystery of how these creatures have risen from their former animal state, to become oppressive rulers of humankind. The books focus on two children, a brother and sister, whose parents are taken by the wolves, and who subsequently join the "Free Folk" and become key to the success of the rebellion. Harland was long fascinated with wolves. He credits this obsession to a childhood experience in the UK, when he passed an ominous wood named 'Wolves Wood' on daily basis in a school bus. This left a marked impression upon him.

The series won the 2008 Aurealis Award for the "best children's illustrated work/picture book" category. In awarding the series an Aurealis, the judges acknowledged the dual work of Harland and his illustrator partner, Peterson: "The illustrations help to bring alive aspects of the story – muscular pictures for a muscular tale. Laura Peterson has shown attention to detail in all the artwork pertaining to the wolves and helps to support the atmosphere of peril that Richard Harland has created."

Other children's fiction 
Walter Wants to Be a Werewolf (2003)
It is part of the Aussie Chomps series aimed at teenagers. Walter is a young member of a family of werewolves, but struggles to manifest true werewolf characteristics when the full moon rises. Subsequently visits a doctor hoping to find a cure for his condition.

Sassycat: The Night of the Dead (2005)
Published by Scholastic, the novel is mostly in the voice of Sassycat, a truly superior cat. She moves to a new home with her mistress/carer, Rebecca, and does not think much of her new animal neighbours. But she has to work with them in order to defeat the ghosts who are invading their territory from a nearby cemetery.

Worldshaker, Liberator, Song of the Slums 
Harland's series of YA steampunk novels commenced with Worldshaker, partly inspired by the works of Mervyn Peake and Charles Dickens. It was released in May 2009 in Australia, then in the United States, UK, France, Germany and Brazil. The main inspiration for this book was the dream he had which is now one of the scenes in the book. The principal character is Col, who lives in the privileged upper sections of a mountain-sized city-ship. He has been selected to become the next commander of the craft, but is forced to question his world when a girl who has escaped from the lower decks, seeks his help and reveals to him the poverty and exploitation below the elite world of his upbringing. The novel sold to American publisher Simon & Schuster for a substantial advance.

The story bears a resemblance to the plot of the 1927 film Metropolis. Both feature a young male heir to a position of power in an unfair class-based society, with a young woman of the worker class teaming together with the young man to overthrow the cruel establishment.

Harland began developing the ideas for Worldshaker in the mid-1990s and took five years to write the novel, passing through 3 complete rewrites. It was first entitled Leviathan, later Juggernaught, before finally being published as Worldshaker. The sequel to Worldshaker was published globally by the same publishers as Liberator.

For his third steampunk novel, Harland shifted the setting to an earlier period in the same world, later than the Napoleonic invasion of England (by a tunnel which was planned, but never built, in real history), but before the launching of the great city-ships or juggernauts. The principal character is Astor, who starts out from a refined and privileged background and ends up in the incredibly polluted, fog-bound slums of 'London Town'. There she falls in with a gang and discovers a talent as a drummer playing a new kind of rhythmical music—which is essentially rock 'n roll—only a century before Elvis and Bill Haley. The novels tells the story of the triumph of 'gang music' and the rise to popularity of Astor's band. It also contains a subplot to take power by a group of oligarchs, and explores Astor's relationship with the enigmatic Verrol.

Shorter works of fiction
Harland has published over 20 short stories and novellas in magazines and anthologies in the United States, Australia, Canada and France. His work has been included in 'best of' anthologies such as Dreaming Again, Dreaming in the Dark and Ghosts by Gaslight, compiled by American editor and anthologist, Jack Dann, The Best Horror of the Year, (ed Ellen Datlow, US), Year's Best Fantasy 9 (ed Hartwell and Cramer, US), Year's Best Australian Science Fiction & Fantasy 4 (ed Congreve and Marquardt), The Year's Best Australian Fantasy & Horror 2011 (ed Grzyb and Helene), and in France, Ténebres 2007, (ed Benoit Domis). Several of his stories have received honourable mentions in the Year's Best Fantasy and Horror anthologies, edited by Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling. His shorter fiction has been both nominated for and won Australian speculative fiction awards.

Ariyapadaiveedu is a village in the Kumbakonam taluk of Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu.

Demographics 

As per the 2001 census, Aiyapadaiveedu had a total population of 922, with 481 males, and 441 females. The sex ratio was 917. The literacy rate was 78.9.
Electrical insulation papers are paper types that are used as electrical insulation in many applications due to pure cellulose having outstanding electrical properties. Cellulose is a good insulator and is also polar, having a dielectric constant significantly greater than one.
Electrical paper products are classified by their thickness, with tissue considered papers less than 1.5 mils (0.0381 mm) thickness, and board considered more than 20 mils (0.508 mm) thickness.

History
The use of paper board as electrical insulation paper started in the early-mid 20th century. Since the need for high voltage electrical transformers, there has been a need for an insulating material that could withstand the high electrical and physical stresses experienced around a core and windings. Pressboard, a board made by compressing layers of paper together and drying them, has been used for installation purposes in many of the first electrical machines. However, as electrical technology increased, the need for a higher density material that was capable of insulating larger and higher voltage transformers grew. In the late 1920s, Hans Tschudi-Faude became the director of H. Weidmann Limited and began developing a type of pressboard that would meet the higher standards needed for the newer, more powerful transformers. Unlike older methods of pressboard production, Transformerboard was not based on used paper or cotton waste but was made with high-grade sulfate cellulose. The new product was made purely out of cellulose without a resin or binder, improving electrical insulation capabilities and could be completely dried, degassed, and oil impregnated. The new product became famous under the name Transformerboard. Throughout the 1930s, new methods of production and advances in understanding replaced almost all insulating parts of transformers with parts made from transformer board.

In 1970, a branch of Weidmann Electrical Industries centered in St. Johnsbury, Vermont produced the largest Transformerboard ever measuring 12'5" by 21'8". At the time, the Vermont-based company was named EHV Industries.

Production

The more demanding application the cleaner the paper needs to be. Paper machines are run with deionised or even distilled process water when producing higher grades of electrical insulation paper. Electrical insulation papers are made from well delignified unbleached kraft pulp.

Applications

Cable paper
Electrical cables are categorized by the voltage and current used. Telephone cables have moderate voltage and current associated with cables leading moderate electric current or transmitting electrical signals. The telephone cables have a large number of conductors that are individually insulated. In order to not become excessively thick the paper needs to be thin (30-40 g/m2). A normal power cable needs more insulation and therefore paper with higher paper density is used, normally 60-190 g/m2. The paper needs to be strong, elastic, uniform and free of holes or debris. These applications are being replaced by plastic insulation.

High voltage power cable paper
Submarine power cables at very high voltages (> 400 kV) are a very demanding application. The paper is normally 65-155 g/m2 and mostly produced on two ply paper machines. An advantage of using paper in sea cables is that in case of leakage, the paper will swell and prevent water from flowing along the cable.

Capacitor tissue
This paper is used in capacitors and is an extremely clean and thin tissue paper (normally 6-12 g/m2) that is super calendered. The pulp is clean unbleached kraft pulp that is extremely refined. The paper is made on small paper machines with slow speeds because the stock has to be drained very slowly.

Transformer board
Transformer board is used mainly in oil-filled transformers where a solid insulating structure is needed. This is a pressboard up to 8 mm in thickness. The board is built up wet on forming cylinders and cut off when at the desired thickness. This makes a sheet with the size of the width and circumference of the drum. The wet sheets are hot- or cold-press dried and finished on separate machines.

The Settlers' House was built in 1845 in East Charlotte, Vermont. The house is set up at the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont, to show visitors life in the 18th century. The barn situated next to the house was built as a working demonstration in 2001.

History
French Canadian lumberjacks probably built the Settlers' Cabin in East Charlotte in about 1800. Constructed of hand-hewn and dovetailed beech and pine timbers, Settlers' Cabin is typical of the type of structure that Vermont settlers, loggers, and trappers often built as temporary homes.

When the Shelburne Museum acquired the structure in 1955, clapboard facing obscured the log structure beneath. After moving the building's exterior walls to the grounds intact, the museum provided a new foundation, replaced the roof, and restored the cabin's single interior room, stone fireplace, and sleeping loft. The structure, in combination with the adjacent hay barn, which the museum constructed in 2001, now houses the museum's only living exhibition that reveals how early Vermont settlers lived.

In 1959 the museum constructed the sawmill adjacent to the Settlers' Cabin. In colonial America wood was needed to construct everything from sailing ships to storage kegs, and lumber, forested by loggers like the French Canadians who built the Settlers' Cabin, quickly emerged as the most important cash crop of 18th-century America. The museum's sawmill illustrates how this cash crop was prepared for market.

Swiftly moving water can create energy powerful enough to run machinery. While in operation, the water's motion forced the sawmill's saw blade up and down, enabling it to cut through logs directed into its path. At full speed, the saw cut two strokes per second, which allowed a sawyer to cut a  board in eight minutes.

Historically the term "sawmill" referred both to the mill building and to the machinery it contained. Shelburne's Sawmill was built to house equipment from a South Royalton, Vermont, sawmill that was operated by Jeremiah Trescott and his partner Captain Stevens from the late 18th century. The Shepard family, descendants of Trescott, continued to operate the mill until the early 20th century and later donated its contents to the museum.

"Elegy XIX: To His Mistress Going to Bed", originally spelled "To His Mistris Going to Bed", is a poem written by the metaphysical poet John Donne.

The elegy was refused a licence for publishing in Donne's posthumous collection, "Poems", in 1633, but was printed in an anthology, "The Harmony of the Muses" in 1654. The poem is classified as one of Donne's love poems, "marked by an energetic, often bawdy wit, a new explicitness about sexual desire and experience, and an irreverent new attitude towards authority figures". Several poetic conventions, such as the blason, metaphysical conceit, neoplatonism and allusion are used by Donne in this work.

Summary 

Throughout the poem, Donne's male speaker urges his mistress into bed. Donne's speaker fervently describes undressing and caressing his mistress, and at the end, the speaker reveals that he is fully unclothed and erect. The process of disrobing is followed from top to toe, centred on the belly and vulva, and each stage compares the beauty of dress as external decoration with the natural beauty of the undressed woman.

Poetic conventions
Donne's poem reinvents Petrarchan poetic conventions, which figured around the despair and heartache brought about by unattainable love. Donne's "Elegy XIX" was also influenced by Ovid's "Elegies", in which Ovid used wit and detachment in describing the male lover's aggressive pursuit of women." By combining Petrarch's technique of "wooing from afar" with Ovid's sexually aggressive language and style, Donne creates a parody of the conventional love sonnet, and an early specimen of libertine poetry.

Blazon 
Ironically, Donne's speaker uses a blazon, or a record of virtues and excellencies to describe his mistress disrobing (Lines 5–18). While standard Petrarchan blazons were used to list a woman's honourable attributes, such as her beauty or chasteness, Donne's poem "removes [the] woman from the pedestal on which she had been adored", placing an erotic emphasis on an otherwise virtuous list. Instead of speaking of his mistress's virtues, Donne's speaker focuses solely on her appearance, which demonstrates that the speaker is looking for a coital experience with love.

Allusion 

The poem is peppered with metaphorical allusion, used to further describe sexual imagery. In Line 21, Donne refers to "Mahomets Paradice", which was peopled with beautiful women ready to satisfy the carnal desires of the male inhabitants. Similarly, Donne mentions that "Gems which you women use/Are like Atalanta's balls, cast in men's views" (35–6); in Greek mythology, Atalanta rejected all suitors who could not defeat her in a race; Hippomenes eventually defeated her by dropping apples along the race trail, which Atalanta stopped to pick up. Donne's connection between religious allusion and eroticism creates a paradox, which suggests that Donne sees physical love as being just as necessary as love for the divine.

Erotic imagery and metaphor 

"Elegy XIX" is full of erotic imagery, which complements Donne's adaptation of Ovidian wit. In the blazon, Donne's speaker orders, "Off with that happy busk, which I envy" (11); Donne's speaker uses the busk as a metaphor of the phallus, although it is unclear whether or not the speaker envies the busk because of its proportions, or because it is close to the mistress's body. Donne's speaker asks his mistress to "Shew/The haiery Diademe which on you doth grow" (15–6), or otherwise, let her hair down, which creates an image of freedom and relaxedness within the bedroom setting (it is also used later in Thomas Carew's "A Rapture").

Donne's metaphysical conceit occurs at line 27; "O my America! my new-found-land/My kingdome, safeliest when with one man man’d/My Myne of precious stones, My Emperie/How blest am I in this discovering thee!" (27–30). K. W. Gransden sees this excerpt as an “analogy from Elizabethan navigation and discovery, by which means he [the speaker] depicts the lover's journey to consummation in the most modern possible fashion. Donne neatly hits the traditional estimate of love by expressing it in terms of an adventure”. Here, Gransden commends Donne's comparison of sexual intercourse to an adventure, which was a modern way for his speaker to coax the mistress into bed.
Donne's metaphysical conceit also dabbles in gendered power dynamics of early modern England. Ilona Bell suggests that "If the woman is [the speaker's] kingdom and his empire, he is her king and emperor, reveling unabashedly in his masculine dominion over her”, which suggests that Donne's speaker takes a position of superiority and governance over his mistress. However, it is important to note that without the "new-found-land", AKA the mistress, Donne's speaker would not be a king. As much as the mistress needs the speaker, the speaker needs the mistress. This is also reverent in the last lines of the poem, "To teach thee, I am naked first, why then/What needst thou have more covering then a man?" (47–8); Donne's speaker removes his clothes to guide, or teach, his mistress; however, since he is naked first, he places himself in a place of vulnerability. Bell notes that "male domination [was] fundamental to Donne's poetic and cultural inheritance. Not surprisingly, therefore, Donne's poems acknowledge the sexual stereotypes and gender hierarchy that subordinated early modern women to men...; however, his poems also dramatise the ways in which Donne challenged... the patriarchal polity and society into which [he was] born and died”. By supplying the reader with a metaphysical conceit that places the speaker over his mistress, but in a way that obviously shows his dependence on her, as well as providing an open-ended scenario where the man is either guiding his mistress into nudity or left vulnerable as she remains clothed, Bell's theory is supported.

Neoplatonism 
Although the elegy is not Donne's most credible neoplatonic work, there is one instance where transcendent love is mentioned. Donne's speaker mentions that "As souls unbodied, bodies uncloth'd must be" (34), which suggests that the spiritual connection of two souls outside of the body, or a Neoplatonic love, is just as crucial and necessary to a relationship as physical, erotic love.


Cronk Urleigh ("hill of the forecourt"; archaic Reneurling)  is a stretch of road situated at the 15th Milestone on the primary A3 Castletown  to Ramsey  in the parish of Kirk Michael in the Isle of Man.

Description
The nearby small hillock of Cronk Urleigh (Reneurling) adjacent to the main A3 Road is traditionally thought to be the site of the original Tynwald courts until 1422, although the site may have been situated at nearby Rhencullen in Kirk Michael.

Origin of name
The name Reneurling is linked with the Tynwald court of 1422.  The modern name of Cronk Urleigh may be incorrectly associated with the incorrect translation of ‘eagle hill.’ 

The Rev John Crellin of Kirk Michael writing in 1774 speculated that the name Cronk Urleigh / Reneurling may have been connected with the name for a Roman Standard used by ancient Roman Armies.

Motor-sport heritage
The Cronk Urleigh section of the A3 Castletown to Ramsey road was part of the 37.50 Mile Four Inch Course used for the RAC Tourist Trophy automobile races held in the Isle of Man between 1908 and 1922.

In 1911, the Four Inch Course for automobiles was first used by the Auto-Cycling Union for the Isle of Man TT motor-cycle races.  This included Cronk Urleigh, the 13th Milestone and the Westwood Corner (Ballalona Bridge) section and the course later became known as the 37.73 mile (60.70 km) Isle of Man TT Mountain Course which has been used since 1911 for the Isle of Man TT Races and from 1923 for the Manx Grand Prix races.

During the 1970 Lightweight TT Race, the Spanish professional motor-cycle racer  Santiago Herrero crashed at Westwood corner section of the TT Course and later dying from his injuries.
Across the Universe is a science fiction novel by American writers Pamela Sargent and George Zebrowski, part of the Star Trek: The Original Series saga.

Synopsis
The Enterprise encounters the ancient colony ship 'Hawking'. Due to the relativistic effects of time travel, the crew and passengers have only aged a few decades while two hundred years have passed since they have launched. The crew of the Enterprise find difficulty dealing with these people from the past. The Hawking colonists are distrustful, somewhat paranoid and the ship itself hides a weapon of mass destruction.

Inspiration

In Voyages of Imagination, George Zebrowski remembered: "Across the Universe went well, with the editing again seeking to keep us to the main characters' viewpoints. I don't recall how the idea was developed, but it was more complex and involved than the final book." On the story, Pamela Sargent adds, "We'd been discussing what might happen if a group of colonists that had set out from Earth to colonize another world, traveling at relativistic speed and aging only two or three decades while a couple of centuries passed, had been overtaken by a more technologically advanced group—in this case, the Enterprise and its crew. We actually wanted much of the story to be about the dilemma of these people, how they might acclimate to their encounter with this future civilization and the psychological problems that might cause. I think we were envisioning a darker more complex tale about people who are slowly aging on a one-way journey, who reach their planetary destination only to discover that the world they thought would be theirs was already settled. In the end, at the editor's suggestion, we ended up writing more of an adventure story. Not necessarily a worse story, simply a different story. Some of the dilemmas our invented characters would have to face are still there, even if they had to be incorporated into a story about an unknown planetary threat."

A change of pace for Marshall, this book is only peripherally concerned with matters of faith and religion.  Strang Methuen is an old soldier, a stiff-necked Scot who serves in the British Army in two world wars.  Methuen is able to show more courage in the face of enemy fire than when dealing with friends and family—those he loves and hates.

Methuen has been bullied since his school days by Hermiston.  For nearly 40 years, every time he thinks he has escaped or defeated the bully, a quirk of fate makes Methuen the goat again.

The very qualities that keep him from winning, integrity and personal honour, also make him a sympathetic and interesting character.

A revelation about his beloved daughter almost crushes Methuen, but he recovers.  The story ends when Methuen, now a brigadier general fighting in World War II Italy, uses his experience and wiles to perform a vital military manoeuvre, preventing a major defeat.  Unfortunately Hermiston, in an attempt to finally put things right, makes a confession which puts Methuen's achievement in a bad light.  He is demoted and leaves the service in disgrace.
Hidden Lives is a 1920 Dutch silent film directed by Maurits Binger. It is based on a novel by John Knittel.

Crown Point Courthouse Square Historic District is a historic district in Crown Point, Indiana, that dates back to 1873. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Its boundaries were changed in 2005, and it was increased in 2007 to include a Moderne architecture building at 208 Main Street. The late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century commercial and public buildings represent a period of economic and political growth. The Lake County Courthouse stands in the center of the district. Designed by architect John C. Cochrane in 1878, this brick building is a combination of Romanesque Revival and Classical styles. Enlarged in 1909 with the addition of north and south wings, designed by Beers and Beers. Continued growth in the county required second enlargement in 1928. This local landmark was placed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The commercial buildings surrounding the courthouse include examples of the most common styles of the late nineteenth century. The I.O.O.F. Building and the commercial buildings at 103 West Joliet Street and 102 South Main Street are Italianate Commercial with decorative pressed-metal details. The Allman Block is the Romanesque Revival style on the square. These structures were built from 1880 to 1891.

The early twentieth-century architecture include the 1908 Carnegie Library  and the Masonic Lodge next to each other on South Main. The Masonic Lodge is a Colonial Revival-style building built c. 1920. Across Main Street are two other examples of the Colonial Revival, the Lake County Criminal Court Building and the Community Center, also from the 1920s.

The Lake County Sheriff's House and Jail, built in 1882, is Second Empire style. These are the first permanent buildings for this purpose. The jail was expanded in 1910. The bulk of the existing two-story building was completed in 1934. This is the jail from which John Dillinger escaped in March 1934 while being held on murder charges. The jail was closed in 1974 and placed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

Significant Buildings

All structures are historically contributing towards the Historic District Status, unless otherwise noted.  An ‘O’ rating signifies that the structure had enough historic or architectural significance to be considered for individual listing in the National Register of Historic Places.  The ‘N’ rating signifies that the structure is above average and may, with further investigation be eligible for an individual listing.  The ‘C’ or contributing rating signifies that the structure meet the basic inventory qualifications, but fails to meet individual merit, but in combination with other closely placed similar structures warrants inclusion in an historic district.

St. James's Church (German: Kirche St. Jakob) is one of two Roman Catholic churches in the parish of Heiligenstadt in the 19th district of Vienna, Döbling. It stands at the Pfarrplatz and is dedicated to James, son of Zebedee (Saint James).

The church is sometimes wrongly called St. Jacob's. The confusion arises because German, like many other languages, uses the same word for both James and Jacob.

Description 
The church takes the form of a simple Romanesque structure. Its modern-day appearance dates back to the 12th century. The church consists of a single nave with a raised and slightly offset choir. The left-hand side of the church has three round arched windows; the right-hand side only two.

History 

Heiligenstadt was early on home to an organised Christian community with regular religious services. St. James's Church's roots can be traced back to the 5th century.

From 1105, there are reports of the presence of a cult to Saint Severinus of Noricum in Heiligenstadt. A document from Bishop Rüdiger von Passau dating from 1243 indicates that the church was a subsidiary of St. Martin in Klosterneuburg. It was made independent in 1246.

A hospital and rectory next to St. James's Church are first mentioned in 1263. In 1307, Heiligenstadt was attached to the Klosterneuburg Monastery, and the parish priests of Heiligenstadt have been Canons Regular ever since. At the time, the parish of Heiligenstadt also covered the neighbouring communities of Grinzing, Sievering, Salmannsdorf, Nussdorf, Oberdöbling and Unterdöbling. The parish chronicle records that the parish was served by one parish priest, two parochial vicars and five mounted chaplains in 1480.

The church was destroyed on 14 October 1529, during the first siege of Vienna. It was rebuilt in 1534 and renovated in 1668. Both the church and the hospital were destroyed in the second siege of Vienna in 1683, whereafter only the church was rebuilt. In 1745, Cardinal Sigismund von Kollonitz donated an artefact belonging to Saint Severinus to the church, which has been revered as a holy relic ever since. The church spire was built in 1752.

During an archaeological dig in 1952-53, the remains of a Roman building were uncovered beneath St. James's Church. The Roman ruins lay within the bounds of the church and sometimes beyond; the building had been destroyed twice and houses two early Christian graves. The tiles used on the graves were produced by the Tenth Legion.

To the north of the church lies a Roman cemetery; an Avar grave was also found near here in 1980. It has been suggested that this cemetery may be the origin of the name Heiligenstadt (Holy town). Every cemetery was once considered a “locus sanctus” (Holy place); this cemetery may have been so significant for Heiligenstadt as it developed during the Middle Ages that the settlement was named after it. Earlier theories that the modern name is a reference to the grave of Saint Severinus have been rejected by more recent research.

Next to the church is a vintner's house in which Ludwig van Beethoven stayed during summer 1817.
The Taralga railway line is a disused branch railway line in the south of New South Wales, Australia. The line commenced at a junction with the Goulburn to Crookwell line at Roslyn station and ran for a distance of  to the small town of Taralga. The line operated between 1926 and 1957 and is one of few lines in New South Wales that has been formally closed by an Act of Parliament. Today all track has been lifted and little trace remains of the infrastructure associated with the line.

History
Demand for a railway line to Taralga existed from the mid 19th century. The town grew significantly in the 1860s, however remained isolated particularly during wet weather, when the poor quality roads in the region could become impassable. A railway connection was seen as highly desirable if the town was to continue to prosper. In 1884, a delegation met with the Minister for Public Works requesting a survey be conducted of a potential route between Roslyn and Taralga, branching off the already surveyed Goulburn to Crookwell route, offering that any private land that would need to be resumed would be given to the Government to facilitate construction. It was not until
1915 that construction of the line by the Department of Public Works was authorised through the passing of the Roslyn to Taralga Railway Act (1915) No 49, at an estimated cost of £87,353.

The Premier of New South Wales, Sir George Fuller turned the first sod on 8 January 1923, following delays due to World War I, which led to the estimated cost of construction rising to £139,700, part of which would be subsidised by charging higher rates for transporting goods on the line compared to the rest of the New South Wales Government Railways. and construction of the branch commenced, opening on 23 February 1926.

Initial services consisted of a mixed train running three days per week between Roslyn and Taralga, a journey taking an hour and fifteen minutes that was timetabled  to allow connections onward to Goulburn and Sydney. This soon became a daily service, however by 1930 it was cut back to twice a week due to a lack of traffic, with additional services operating only when demand required. The line was never profitable as traffic fell further and was formally closed on 1 May 1957, however the last train ran on the line in 1954. Typical goods carried on the line prior to its closure included livestock, wool and potatoes. The tracks were lifted and removed by 1959, and very little infrastructure remains except for the former station building and platforms at Strathaird.
Patrick Kennedy (1832 – June 30, 1895) was an Irish-born contractor and political figure in Quebec. He represented Montréal division no. 6 in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1892 to 1895 as a Conservative.

He was born in Trasersten, County Tipperary, the son of Edward Kennedy. He was a carter and general contractor. In 1861, he married Elizabeth Tracey. Kennedy served on Montreal city council from 1877 to 1883 and from 1887 to 1894. He was president of the Montreal police commission from 1882 to 1883. Kennedy died in office in Montreal at the age of 63 and was buried in the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery.

Rose Hall is a Jamaican Georgian plantation house now run as a historic house museum. It is located in Montego Bay, Jamaica with a panoramic view of the coast. Thought to be one of the country's most impressive plantation great houses, it had fallen into ruins by the 1960s, but was then restored. The museum showcases the slave history of the estate and the legend of the White Witch of Rose Hall.

Known for its impressive architecture and panoramic views of the coast, the mansion has been restored to showcase its original splendor, featuring mahogany floors, silk wallpaper, and European antiques. The estate has a rich history, dating back to its original purchase in 1742 by Henry Fanning. The property eventually passed to John Rose Palmer, who married Anne Mary Patterson. In 1977, the mansion was bought and refurbished by Michele and John Rollins, who transformed it into a museum and tourist attraction focusing on its slave history and the legend of the "White Witch of Rose Hall," Annie Palmer, who allegedly haunts the property.

Description

Rose Hall is widely regarded to be a visually impressive house and the most famous in Jamaica. It is a mansion in Jamaican Georgian style with a stone base and a plastered upper storey, high on the hillside, with a panorama view over the coast. The architect James Hakewill visited the building and wrote:

Rose Hall was restored in the 1960s to its former splendor, with mahogany floors, interior windows and doorways, paneling and wooden ceilings. It is decorated with silk wallpaper printed with palms and birds, ornamented with chandeliers and furnished with mostly European antiques. There is a bar downstairs and a restaurant.

History

The land, 290 acres of caneland, was bought by Henry Fanning for £3,000 in 1742. It was previously called "True Friendship" and had belonged to Richard Lawrence. Henry married Rosa Kelly on July 16, 1746, but died soon afterwards. His widow inherited the estate and married George Ash, a local plantation owner who realised Fanning's plan to build Rose Hall. It cost £30,000 to build and was lavishly decorated with carved mahogany and stone. However Ash died in 1752. Rosa married for a third time, to Norwood Witter in May 1753, who lived until 20 May 1765, managing to consume a significant amount of her fortune. In May 1767 she married John Palmer, a widower who owned the adjoining plantation, "Palmyra".

Rosa died in 1790, leaving her property to her husband. When Palmer died in 1797, he left the property in trust to his two sons John and James Palmer. However, they both died childless, and in 1818 the two estates were passed down to John Rose Palmer, his grandnephew. John Rose Palmer came to Jamaica from England to claim the estate, and on 28 March 1820 he married Anne Mary Patterson from Lucea, Hanover Parish. John Rose Palmer died in November 1827.

Rose Hall estate had about 650 acres divided among sugar cane, grass, and pasture for over 270 head of cattle. About 250 enslaved Africans were housed on Palmyra estate, which comprised about 1,250 acres.

Refurbishment

Rose Hall was bought in 1977 by former Miss USA Michele Rollins and her entrepreneur husband John Rollins. They refurbished it at great personal expense and conceptualised a tour and museum that showcase Rose Hall's slave history, antique splendor and original fittings. Rose Hall also offers night tours that focus on the "Annie Palmer" legend: supposed locations of tunnels, bloodstains, hauntings and murders. Seances are also held on the property in an attempt to conjure Annie's spirit.

Legend

According to legend, a "white witch" called "Annie Palmer" who murdered three husbands haunts the property. An investigation of the legend in 2007 concluded that the story was fictionalized.

Rose Hall was the focus of episode 44 of the popular "How Haunted?" podcast.
Lake Te Kahika is a dune lake located on the Aupouri Peninsula in the Northland Region of New Zealand. It is one of the country's northernmost lakes.

Lake Te Kahika was formed by a stream system impounded by dunes. The lake is shaped with two arms each fed by an inflow and the western edge of the lake discharges into Great Exhibition Bay on the east coast of the peninsula via Kahika Stream.

The lake catchment is predominantly pine plantation forestry, and with the intermediate vegetative zone of manuka and hakea scrub.

The water quality of the lake is monitored by Northland Regional Council
Olivier Saminadin (born 6 September 1977) is a French swimmer from New Caledonia. Due to New Caledonia's status as an overseas territory of France, and its current lack of official recognition by the International Olympic Committee, Saminadin (like other swimmers from New Caledonia, such as Diane Bui Duyet), swims for New Caledonia in regional (Pacific) competition, and for France in continental and above championships.

He won the inaugural 400 I.M. title at the first French Short Course Championships in January 2005.

South Pacific Games
At the 1999 South Pacific Games, he set the Games Record in the men's 200 free (1:56.08).

At the 2003 South Pacific Games he won the 200, 400 and 1500 frees, the 200 fly, the 400 individual medley and the open water race; and was also part of all 3 New Caledonia's relays, each which also won. 

At the 2007 South Pacific Games, he defended his titles in both 400s (free and I.M.), the 1500 and the open water race. He also set the Games Record in the 400 free (4:04.92).
San Juan Chilateca is a town and municipality in Oaxaca in south-western Mexico. The municipality covers an area of 31.9 km².

On 23 July 1983 Duran Duran staged an open air benefit concert at Villa Park, Birmingham, England in front of 18,000 people who paid £8.50 a ticket to raise money for MENCAP. It was one of only two concerts that summer by the band, the other being on 20 July before the Prince and Princess of Wales at London's Dominion Theatre.

Birmingham was chosen as the venue, as it was where the band members' first met and formed the group. The concert and subsequent shows in the area have always been regarded as a "homecoming". This event was particularly special to Roger Taylor as he once had ambitions to be Aston Villa's goalkeeper and was a regular spectator at the ground.

Concert

The show started at 6pm when the host, BBC Radio 1 presenter Peter Powell, introduced the opening act "Prince Charles and the City Beat Band", which was followed by Robert Palmer who included the songs "Johnny and Mary" and "Some Guys Have All the Luck" in his performance. Friendships from this concert helped Palmer, in late 1984, to join members of Duran Duran as lead singer of the super group The Power Station.

Finally, Duran Duran took to the stage at 20:40 Hrs beginning their opening song as two giant black curtains slid open revealing them on a brightly lit stage with a backdrop consisting of six inflatable Roman-style pillars designed by Henry Thompson. The band performed the following:

 "Is There Something I Should Know?"
 "Hungry Like the Wolf"
 "Union of the Snake"
 "Lonely in Your Nightmare"
 "New Religion"
 "Night Boat"
 "Friends of Mine"
 "Save a Prayer"
 "Planet Earth"
 "My Own Way"
 "Hold Back the Rain"
 "Careless Memories"
 "Rio"
 "Fun Time"
 "Girls on Film"

The concert finished at 22:00 Hrs with an after show "homecoming" party held at the city's Rum Runner nightclub.

The programme which consists of 11 glossy double sided flyers with pictures on each side housed in a white glossy folder cost £2.00.

Place names

 Etten-Leur, a town in the Netherlands, in the province of North-Brabant, comprising two former villages, Etten and LeurChalk heath is a rare habitat, in the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome, formed of a paradoxical mixture of shallow-rooted calcifuge ("calcium-hating") and deeper-rooted calcicole ("calcium-loving") plants, growing on a thin layer of acidic soil over an alkaline substrate.  Chalk heath is intermediate between two much more widespread habitats, chalk grassland and heathland.

Ecology
Chalk heath occurs where a thin layer of acidic soil (often loess or sand) overlies a basic (alkaline) one, such as chalk.  Shallow-rooted plants grow only in the acidic soil (typically a few centimetres thick), and so these are species characteristic of acidic habitats.  Deeper-rooted plants can reach the underlying alkaline substrate, and so these include species characteristic of alkaline habitats.  Plants also occur which are able to tolerate both acidic and basic conditions.  There are no plants restricted entirely to chalk heath, and the animals are also those characteristic of chalk grassland and heathland.  The vegetation structure of chalk heath resembles grass heath, being short grassy vegetation with heather growing up through it, with some scattered heather bushes.

Chalk heath often occurs at the tops of slopes, at the thin margins of acidic deposits which often cap the flatter tops of chalk hills.  It usually gives way to chalk grassland on lower slopes where these deposits have been eroded away, and often to heathland on the hilltops where the acidic deposits are thicker.  Chalk heath tends to occur as narrow strips and scattered fragments, being limited to places where the conditions are exactly right for its development and survival.

Chalk heath is a grazing habitat, created and maintained by livestock (usually sheep and cattle) and rabbits.

Vegetation
Chalk heath in southern Britain includes calcicoles such as salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris) and common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), and calcifuges such as bell heather (Erica cinerea), ling heather (Calluna vulgaris), heath grass (Danthonia decumbens), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella) and betony (Stachys officinalis).  It also includes plants which can tolerate both acidic and basic conditions, such as common bent (Agrostis capillaris), wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) and sometimes juniper (Juniperus communis).

Conservation
Chalk heath has suffered a parallel decline to those of heathland and chalk grassland, but because of the scattered and fragmented distribution of suitable soil conditions it has declined even more than those habitats.  Many examples have disappeared due to agricultural improvement, or to a lack of grazing management, which leads to replacement by species-poor scrub and woodland.  Chalk heath is especially sensitive to soil disturbance such as ploughing, which mixes the thin layer of acidic soil with the chalk beneath.

Headley Heath in Surrey, England.  Small areas of chalk heath surrounding a larger plateau of heathland.
Lullington Heath in East Sussex, England.  Relatively large areas of chalk heath with some chalk grassland.
Kingley Vale National Nature Reserve, in West Sussex, England.  Small areas of chalk heath at the top of a steep chalk escarpment.

Facilities and aircraft 
The airport covers an area of  at an elevation of 272 feet (83 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 13/31 is 6,500 by 150 feet (1,981 x 46 m) and 18/36 is 5,000 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m).

For the 12-month period ending January 31, 2009, the airport had 17,700 aircraft operations, an average of 48 per day: 93% general aviation, 5% air taxi, 2% military. At that time there were 33 aircraft based at this airport: 82% single-engine, 9% multi-engine, 6% jet and 3% helicopter.

Past airline service 

Historically, Natchez had scheduled airline service operated by Southern Airways for many years.  Southern commenced operations into the airport during the early 1950s with Douglas DC-3 aircraft.  The December 1, 1973 Southern Airways system timetable lists several flights a day to Jackson, Memphis, New Orleans and other destinations operated with 40-passenger Martin 4-0-4 propliners.  Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) also briefly served Natchez from 1959 through 1961 with flights to Jackson MS, and to Houston, TX with a stop in Alexandria, LA. TTa operated 21-seat Douglas DC-3s. After Southern ended all flights to Natchez in 1975, service was replaced by a commuter airline, South Central Air Transport (SCAT) which flew Handley Page Jetstream turboprops to Jackson, New Orleans and other destinations. SCAT was acquired by Air Illinois in 1977 which then extended their commuter service down south and served Natchez from 1977 through 1980. From 1980 through 1986 Royale Airlines operated commuter turboprop aircraft to Jackson and New Orleans.  Natchez then went without commercial air service until 1994 when Lone Star Airlines briefly operated Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner commuter propjet flights direct to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) via an intermediate stop in Nacogdoches, TX.  The airport has not had any scheduled airline flights since 1994.
The Pastures Historic District is a residential neighborhood located south of downtown Albany, New York, United States. Its  include all or part of a 13-block area.

It was originally an area set aside as communal pasture by Albany's city council in the late 17th century and deeded to the Dutch Reformed Church. As the city began to grow following its designation as New York's state capital a century later, it was subdivided into building lots, some of which were developed with small rowhouses. Many open areas remain today, and the houses have not been significantly altered. In 1972 the city designated it as a historic district and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. All but two buildings in the district are considered historic.

One of Albany's busiest neighborhoods in the 19th century, the area fell into decline during the third quarter of the 20th as citizens left the city for the suburbs. Instead of the wholesale demolition of that era's urban renewal programs, the city government attempted to preserve and revitalize the area,
evacuating the residents for years and demolishing some properties, a move that has been criticized as destroying the neighborhood as a standard urban renewal project would have. A recent mortgage fraud scandal has affected the neighborhood also, but it has once again become a diverse, fully occupied neighborhood.

Geography

The Pastures Historic District is located on the south side of the South Mall Expressway that leads traffic from the Dunn Memorial Bridge over the Hudson River into Empire State Plaza, the modernist complex that houses New York's state government offices. The area is almost flat, rising minimally away from the river, in contrast to the Mansion Historic District, which rises up the slope to the west.

The district boundary is described as Madison Avenue on the north, South Ferry Street on the south, Dongan and Green streets on the east and South Pearl Street (NY 32) on the west. Bleeker, Franklin, Herkimer, John, South Lansing and Westerlo between South Pearl and Green are within the district. The actual boundary was not clarified by the city and state until 12 years after the district was listed, and does not follow those streets completely, excluding some more modern properties and areas where demolitions took place.

As defined in 1984, no property that actually fronts on South Pearl is within the district. All the properties along the south side of Madison are included, as are those on the west side of Green. Just south of Herkimer the three properties on the east side of Green are within the boundary, and then one block south of South Lansing it takes in the rows on the east side again as well as the north side of Westerlo.

The entire block with the now-closed St. John's Roman Catholic Church is included, and the boundary follows Dongan to the South Ferry corner, where it turns west to follow that street. As at the northern end, all properties along the north side of South Ferry are within the district. It excludes the lot at the corner of South Pearl and follows the rear lines of houses on South Ferry to Franklin Street, leaving out not only the newer buildings along South Pearl but the parking lots behind them as well. It follows the property lines along Westerlo west of Franklin to include the houses on both sides of that street, then returns to Franklin again.

All the houses on both sides of Herkimer between Franklin and South Pearl are within the boundary. The parking lot that was once the western block of Bleeker is outside the district, and then the boundary returns to the rear lot lines along Madison.

There are 112 buildings in this 17-acre (7 ha) area. Only two are not considered contributing properties to the district's historic character. Many of the buildings are rowhouses in the Federal and Greek Revival styles. They do not fully cover their lots, leaving a considerable amount of open space in the district. Some of it is taken up by off-street parking, some of it is left undeveloped as lawns and parks, and a tennis court has been built on John Street between Franklin and Green (complemented by two others just outside the district).

The only non-residential properties are three institutions: the former St. John's Church, its school and a synagogue. School No. 15, the only educational building in the district, burned down in 1979, during the city's attempts to revitalize the neighborhood.

History

The Pastures was made available for development not long after American independence, but took a while to become a popular building location. Three-quarters of its buildings were constructed between 1815 and 1855. Some were later demolished during the 1970s.

17th and 18th centuries

The Dutch colonists who founded what became Albany in the mid-17th century set aside this land, outside the city's stockade, as common pasture. In 1687, the year after Albany became an English colonial city and received its charter, the city council donated the land to the Dutch Reformed Church. The land remained in the church's hands, used as pasture, for almost a century.

What is today South Pearl Street was the only route to, or through, the area. It was a path used to take cattle to graze and was known as "Cow Street" occasionally for that reason. Modest homes were built along it north of the stockade after the death of the original landowner in 1766. When George Washington supposedly used it to visit the Schuyler Mansion in 1783, the street became Washington Street.

After the Revolutionary War and independence, the city urged the church to subdivide the land into building-sized lots and sell them for development. This took place slowly, mainly along the main streets. The early settlers of the area, the city's first growth outside of its stockade, were mostly wealthy families who built in the Federal style popular in the early republic.

19th century

Spencer Stafford, a successful merchant, built 100 Madison Avenue in 1808. It remains the oldest building in the district and one of the oldest in the city. The nearby house at 96 Madison, built three years later, was considered the most elegant private home in the city at that time. Four of the six houses on the row next to it at 82–94 Madison, built after another three years, in 1814, were owned by Union College founder Dudley Walsh. Citizens of more modest means also settled in the Pastures. There were homes of tradesmen, craftsmen and free African Americans as well.

In the next two decades, stone yards were opened at several locations in the future district. Middle-class citizens continued settling there, joined by carpenters and builders who bought several lots at once, put up a row, lived in one unit and rented out the others. The houses they built, many of which survive on South Ferry between Franklin and Green, introduced the third story, gabled roof and dormer windows to the neighborhood. Joseph C. Yates lived at 96 Madison while he served as governor.

As building continued into the late 1830s and 1840s, houses reflected an austere Greek Revival style. They were mostly brick laid in Flemish bond primarily, with running and American bond appearing more. Plain pilasters flanked the recessed entrances, with little ornament on the front facades. Newer roofing materials and methods made flat roofs possible. Some frame stores, most since demolished, were constructed in the neighborhood.

The years before, during and after the Civil War were the last for large-scale building within the Pastures. The neighborhood was getting built up, such that a school was built, and other, newer areas of the city were available. Most new rowhouses replaced earlier frame buildings, with 51–55 Westerlo Street the only significant new grouping. Mixed-use development began to appear, with new houses having commercial space on the first story and living space above. Ornate storefronts survive at 79 South Ferry and 104 Madison. Older houses also saw their facades updated with timely decorations like bracketed cornices, metal lintels and ornate friezes. Third stories were added to some flat-roofed buildings.

There are a few scattered houses from around the district postdating this period. The ornate brickwork at 77 Westerlo, dating to 1886, stands out in its neighborhood. On the other extreme, the austerity of 68 and 70 Westerlo reflects vernacular applications of early 20th century styles. The greatest change to the district in this period was the conversion of some residences on Madison west of Franklin into stores.

20th century

In the first decade of the new century, a Roman Catholic Church and synagogue were built in the district. The Gothic Revival stone towers of St. John's, at 140 Green Street, began looming over the district in 1903, along with its neighboring school. The brick Beth El Jacob following in 1907 at 76 Herkimer Street. The neighborhood was complete now.

Pastures' storefronts became known for their jazz bars, and as Albany's red-light district, in the early 20th century.  In 1940, 76 Westerlo Street became the youngest contributing property in the future historic district. During the war years, the Pastures remained a thriving, socioeconomically and ethnically diverse neighborhood.

In the 1950s, suburbanization began, and affluent Albanians began leaving. The construction of Empire State Plaza during the 1960s displaced more residents, and the city's central areas, including the Pastures began showing signs of urban decay.  Late in the decade, the city's new Historic Resources Commission designated the area the Pastures Preservation District and got it listed on the Register in 1972.

Having recognized the area's historic character and importance, the city had big plans for the area. The Democratic political machine of Daniel P. O'Connell mostly eschewed the federal Title I funds for the massive urban renewal programs of the era, since they wanted to retain control of patronage. With what money they did have, they chose a plan that would, they hoped, "revitalize" the neighborhood and preserve what had been recognized as special about it. They moved residents out, temporarily they hoped, while selected decrepit buildings were demolished and new ones built in sympathetic styles. Nearly half of all the buildings in the district were demolished, the rest "mothballed" without heating.

While the neighborhood was vacant, the city sought a developer willing to take on the whole area. Individuals who approached with plans to buy and restore one or two houses at a time, and live there when finished, were turned away while the buildings remained empty and decayed further, some of them succumbing to arson, including the school.

By 1980 the city reduced its expectations and looked only for developers for whole blocks, not the neighborhood. Half of the finished units would have to rented to low-income families. Eventually the Pastures was repopulated, but to some critics the damage to both its human and architectural character had been done. "The real place ceased to exist when its last resident was trundled off to a distant housing project", urbanist Roberta Brandes Gratz wrote a quarter-century later. She calls the Pastures project "a vivid example of the inappropriateness of Historic Preservation as The Answer". Some of the buildings have, she notes, been incorrectly restored and "the area looks more like a sanitized suburban enclave ... than an urban neighborhood".

21st century

By the early 21st century the neighborhood had fully repopulated again, and the city's planning commissioner noted the "mix of incomes and occupations that we strive for in our city neighborhoods." Many units had been set aside as Section 8 affordable housing, and small businesses had moved into the area. 96 Madison is now a bed and breakfast. Residents like its walkability and proximity to downtown, with one even comparing it to Greenwich Village.

The neighborhood seemed to be getting over its recent past when another redevelopment-related setback occurred. At the beginning of the century, Aaron Dare, former head of the Northeast New York chapter of the Urban League, began filing falsified mortgage applications for a variety of Albany properties, including Historic Pastures Village Apartments, through his company, Emerge Real Properties. He and his co-conspirators made it appear that they had the capital to borrow  from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to buy the properties. After the closing, he failed to repay the loans and they quickly went into default, forcing HUD to foreclose. He was eventually investigated and arrested. In 2006 he pleaded guilty to various charges of conspiracy and fraud. Two years later he was sentenced to 63 months in prison and ordered to pay almost $2 million in restitution to his victims.

He was born in Rigaud, Canada East, the son of Hyacinthe Cholet and Julie Séguin, and was educated at the Collège Bourget and Victoria College in Montreal. He received his diploma in medicine in 1876 and set up practice in Sainte-Justine-de-Newton. In 1883, Cholette married Marie-Corinne Taylor. He was a justice of the peace and also served on the municipal council for Sainte-Justine-de-Newton. Cholette was defeated by Émery Lalonde when he ran for a seat in the Quebec assembly in 1890. He defeated Lalonde in 1892 but lost to him when he ran for reelection in 1897. Cholette died in Sainte-Justine-de-Newton at the age of 49.
Louis Gentil Field is an abandoned airfield in Morocco, located approximately 6 km north-northeast of Youssoufia, about 170 km southwest of Casablanca.

History
Prior to World War II, Louis Gentil Airport was a regional airport built by the French Colonial government, named after Louis Gentil, a French geologist.  The airport was seized by invading Allied forces shortly after the Operation Torch landings in November 1942 and used by the United States Army Air Force as a Twelfth Air Force fighter airfield during the North African Campaign.

The 91st and 92d Fighter squadrons of the 81st Fighter Group briefly used the airfield from mid-December 1942 through early 1943 flying P-39 Airacobras.  The squadrons moved up to Mediouna Airfield, and the airfield was returned to civil control.

Today the remains of the main runway can be seen in an agricultural field, but no structures remain.
The European Jewish Fund (EJF) is an international non-governmental organisation that coordinates and supports programmes and events aimed at improving interreligious and interethnic relations, reinforcing Jewish identity, counteracting assimilation, promoting tolerance and reconciliation in Europe, fighting against xenophobia, extremism and antisemitism, and preserving the memory of the Holocaust. The EJF was established in 2006 on the initiative of Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor, who is President of the European Jewish Congress and EJF Chairman. Ariella Woitchik is EJF Secretary General.

The Fund's governing body is Advisory Council, which consists of representatives from European Jewish communities.

The EJF implements local, regional and pan-European projects initiated by both individual communities and the Fund itself. The EJF's main goal is to strengthen Jewish identity and bringing Jewish communities together. Its activities develop national pride and reinforce Jewish pride within communities. The EJF highlights and celebrates Jews and their remarkable contributions to European and global society and culture.

The Fund also implements large-scale programmes aimed at disseminating tolerance on the European continent, strengthening mutual respect among representatives of all nationalities and faiths, reinforcing Jews’ cultural pride and counteracting assimilation. The EJF actively fights xenophobia, antisemitism and racial discrimination and develops proposals and recommendations on reinforcing the fight against these negative phenomena of the modern world. It is also committed to promoting educational programmes that ensure the lessons and memory of the Holocaust live on.

Projects
The Fund's activities fall into several categories: education and leadership; culture and heritage; community building; Shoah memory.

One of the EJF's founders, the World Holocaust Forum Foundation, holds together with the European Jewish Congress the “Let My People Live!” international forums. To date four of these forums have been held, the last two in cooperation with the President of the European Parliament:

January 2005 – The first forum, in Krakow, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.
September 2006 – The second forum, in Kiev, marked 65 years since the atrocity in Babi Yar.
January 2010 – The third forum, in Krakow, commemorating the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.
January 2015 – The fourth forum took place in Prague and Terezin, commemorating the 70th anniversary since the liberation of concentration and death camps.

The EJF helps organise these high-level international gatherings to preserving historical memory and evidence, and encourage the international community to unite in the fight against hatred and xenophobia.

Other EJC activities are:

Publicising the achievements of outstanding individuals of Jewish origin: in order to reduce the level of antisemitism, xenophobia and nationalism in Europe. The EJF supports the Museum of Avant-Garde Mastery, containing a collection of works by famous Russian artists of Jewish origin including Valentin Serov, Léon Bakst, Marc Chagall, El Lissitzky and Chaïm Soutine.
Promoting nuclear non-proliferation and preventing a nuclear holocaust: The EJF supports the activities of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe, which consists of prominent political and public figures, diplomats and nuclear experts. The EJF's leadership believes that the Iranian nuclear programme is one of the major threats to global security today.
Providing a platform for reinforcing relations between European Jewish communities: Annual EJF Advisory Council meetings foster dialogue between Jewish communities, with open exchanges of experience that produce cooperative solutions to shared challenges.

The Fund actively participated in the organisation of the European Week of Tolerance, held in large European cities on November 9–16, 2008. This series of events marked both the International Day for Tolerance and the 70th anniversary of die Kristallnacht. Within the framework of the European Week of Tolerance, prominent leaders, business people and scholars came together for a series of meetings. The European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe were presented with the draft European Framework Convention on Promoting Tolerance and Combating Intolerance and the Concept for a White Paper on Tolerance.
Peter Joseph "Piet" Engels (25 September 1923 – 13 April 1994) was a Dutch politician of the defunct Catholic People's Party (KVP) now merged into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).

Career
Piet Engels opened the Lindenberg Nijmegen Culture House in 1972. Initially there were free academies a music school and a Public Library.

Decorations
The Point Peninsula complex was an indigenous culture located in Ontario and New York from 600 BCE to 700 CE (during the Middle Woodland period).  Point Peninsula ceramics were first introduced into Canada around 600 BCE then spread south into parts of New England around 200 BCE.  Some time between 300 BCE and 1 CE, Point Peninsula pottery first appeared in Maine, and "over the entire Maritime Peninsula."  Little evidence exists to show that it was derived from the earlier, thicker pottery, known as Vinette I, Adena Thick, etc...   Point Peninsula pottery represented a new kind of technology in North America and has also been called Vinette II. Compared to existing ceramics that were thicker and less decorated, this new pottery has been characterized by "superior modeling of the clay with vessels being thinner, better fired and containing finer grit temper."  Where this new pottery technology originated is not known for sure. The origin of this pottery is "somewhat of a problem."  The people are thought to have been influenced by the Hopewell traditions of the Ohio River valley. This influence seems to have ended about 250 CE, after which they no longer practiced burial ceremonialism.

Hopewell interaction sphere
The Hopewell exchange system began in the Ohio and Illinois River valleys about 300 BCE. The culture is referred to more as a system of interaction among a variety of societies than as a single society or culture. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast. In some areas Point Peninsula people buried some of their dead in mortuary mounds. Interred with the dead were exotic grave goods, including copper and silver pan pipes, marine shell gorgets, and exotic cherts. The exotic goods among the burials may provide evidence for inherited status differentiation among Point Peninsula groups. Pan pipes, which have been found in burial mounds from Florida to Minnesota, considered to be a diagnostic trait within the Hopewell inventory, appear suddenly in North America around 200 BCE, then disappear as do certain other  Hopewell traits, around 400 CE.  Found mostly in the United States, nine pan pipes curiously appear in the LeVesconte mound, a Point Peninsula site located in Campbellford, Ontario. Though the Hopewell interaction sphere generally is confined to the United States, much of the silver found in mound artifacts, such as pan pipes, actually comes from Cobalt, Ontario, far up the Ottawa River.

Point Peninsula complex
The Point Peninsula people of the Middle Woodland period lived by hunting and gathering, supplemented by agriculture. Around 900 CE, Point Peninsula artifacts in New York were replaced by Owasco culture artifacts. However, a 2011 paper by archaeologist John P. Hart argues there was no definable Owasco culture. Archaeologists believe these indicated the presence of Clemson Island peoples' spreading northward and intermingling with the Point Peninsula complex through the years of 1300.

The Owasco peoples practiced different pottery techniques and were more sedentary agriculturalists than the Point Peninsula people. They cultivated a variety of types of maize, squash, and eventually beans, and lived in larger villages of several hundred to a thousand people. Warfare was prevalent, as is shown by archeology. The people built fortified villages, but many still died violently. Gradually, smaller bands and tribes formed into larger groups. The Owasco are thought to have eventually developed into the several Iroquoian-speaking nations of Pennsylvania and New York. The Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy likely formed in an effort to avoid the continual warfare of years past.

Some important sites are the Rice Lake/Lower Trent River area, including the Serpent Mounds Park, Cameron's Point and LeVescounte Mounds in Prince Edward County.

Serpent Mounds Park
The Serpent Mounds Park at Rice Lake was occupied during the prehistoric Middle Woodland period. The burial mound was shaped like a giant snake.

Mothers Alone: Poverty and the Fatherless Family is a book by the British sociologist Dennis Marsden based on a study with the same name in 1955–1966. The aim of the study is to learn more about the lives of mothers living alone, whether they are unmarried, separated, divorced, or widowed.  

The study was developed from the larger "Poverty in the UK" project by Peter Townsend and Mothers Alone was meant to analyse the problems that families experience due to low levels of income and the lack of fathers. Questions asked in the study include issues such as housing conditions, homelessness, diet and nutrition, family relations and the adequacy of assistance offered. 

Most of the data has been digitalized and it can be obtained, together with additional study information, from the Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS) website.

Jane Taylor (23 September 178313 April 1824) was an English poet and novelist best known for the lyrics of the widely known "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". The sisters Jane and Ann Taylor and their authorship of various works have often been confused, partly because their early ones were published together. Ann Taylor's son, Josiah Gilbert, wrote in her biography, "Two little poems – 'My Mother,' and 'Twinkle, twinkle, little Star' – are perhaps more frequently quoted than any; the first, a lyric of life, was by Ann, the second, of nature, by Jane; and they illustrate this difference between the sisters."

Biography

Early life
Born in London, Jane Taylor lived with her family at Shilling Grange in Shilling Street, Lavenham, Suffolk, where her house can still be seen. Her mother was the writer Ann Taylor. In 1796–1810, she lived in Colchester. "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" was written in New House, Ongar, as confirmed by descendants of the Taylor family. The Taylor sisters belonged to an extensive literary family. Their father, Isaac Taylor of Ongar, was an engraver and later a dissenting minister. Their mother, Ann Taylor (née Martin) (1757–1830), wrote seven works of moral and religious advice, two of which were fictionalized.

Literary career

The collection Original Poems for Infant Minds by several young persons was solicited by the publisher Darton and Harvey and published anonymously. The main contributors were Ann Taylor, Jane Taylor, and Adelaide O'Keeffe, but Bernard Barton and various other members of the Taylor family contributed to it as well. As Donelle Ruwe writes in her study of its genesis and reception history, it was issued as a single-volume work in 1804. When it proved successful, further poems were solicited for an additional volume, which was published in 1805. Over time, the collection became associated with the Taylor family. Although O'Keeffe wrote to the publisher requesting a greater percentage of the collection's proceeds, Darton and Harvey deferred to the Taylor family regarding all editorial decisions. For their part, the Taylor family was openly hostile to O'Keeffe and dismissive of her background in writing for the stage. (O'Keeffe's father was the popular Irish playwright John O'Keeffe.)

After the success of Original Poems for Infant Minds, Ann and Jane Taylor published the poetry collections Rhymes for the Nursery in 1806 and Hymns for Infant Minds in 1810. In the two volumes of Original Poems for Infant Minds, the Taylor sisters, O'Keeffe, and the other contributors were identified as authors for each poem by initial or other identifying markers. In Rhymes for the Nursery (1806), Ann and Jane Taylor were not identified as the collection's authors or individual poems. The most famous piece in the 1806 collection is "The Star," commonly known today as "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", which was set to a French tune.

Christina Duff Stewart identifies authorship in Rhymes for the Nursery based on a copy belonging to Canon Isaac Taylor, who noted the pieces by Ann and Jane Taylor. Canon Isaac was Taylor's nephew, a son of her brother Isaac Taylor of Stanford Rivers. Stewart also confirms attributions of Original Poems based on the publisher's records.

Jane Taylor also wrote the popular moral verse, The Violet, which begins:
Down in a green and shady bed,
A modest violet grew;
Its stalk was bent, it hung its head
As if to hide from view.
And yet it was a lovely flower,
Its colour bright and fair;
It might have graced a rosy bower,
Instead of hiding there.

Taylor's novel Display (1814), reminiscent of Maria Edgeworth or perhaps even Jane Austen, went through at least 13 editions up to 1832. Her Essays in Rhyme appeared in 1816, and contained some significant poetry. In the fictional Correspondence between a Mother and Her Daughter at School (1817), Taylor collaborated with her mother. The Family Mansion. A Tale appeared in 1819, and Practical Hints to Young Females some time before 1822.

Jane Taylor accepted the editorship of the religious Youth's Magazine. She wrote numerous shorter pieces for the magazine, including moral tales and personal essays, and these were collected in The Contributions of Q. Q.  Throughout her life, Taylor wrote many essays, plays, stories, poems, and letters which were never published. She was also erroneously named as author of works such as The Authoress (1819), Prudence and Principle (1818), and Rachel: A Tale (1817).

Death
Jane Taylor died on 13 April 1824 of breast cancer at the age of 40, her mind still "teeming with unfulfilled projects". She was buried at Ongar churchyard in Essex. After her death, her brother Isaac collected many of her works and included a biography of her in The Writings of Jane Taylor, In Five Volumes (1832).

Popular influence
Taylor's most famous verse, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", is almost always uncredited. "Its opening stanza persists as if it were folklore, the name of its creator almost entirely forgotten." Alternative versions, pastiches and parodies abounded. See main article.
The best-known parody of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is a poem recited by the Mad Hatter in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865).
Jane Taylor is credited by Robert Browning in an introductory note to a late poem, "Rephan", which he states was "suggested by a very early recollection of a prose story" by her.

Summary of raiding history
Bahshamiyya (also known as "Ba Hashimiyya") was a Mu'tazili-influenced school of thought, rivaling the school of Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad, based primarily on the earlier teaching of Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i, the son of Abu 'Ali Muhammad al-Jubba'i.

Borne from Mu'tazila 
Mu'tazila is a school of rationalist Islamic theology known as Kalam. Early practitioners stressed the supremacy of human reason and free-will (similar to Qadariyya) and went on to develop an epistemology, ontology and psychology which provide a basis for explaining the nature of the world, God, man and religion.  According to Mu'tazilis, good and evil are easily reconciled through human reason without esoteric methods.
  
The Mu'tazila school started in the 8th century; its iterative refinement continued from the late 10th century until mid-11th century CE. Mu'tazila was briefly the official theology of the Abbasid caliphs in the 9th century. The impact of Mu'tazila doctrine continues to be felt in primarily three groups: Shi'a (Ismai'li) Islam, Karaite Judaism, and to a much lesser extent Rabbanite Judaism of the Sephardic Rite and Yemenite rite.

Two Schools 

By the end of the 9th century Mu'tazila had split into two schools:

1. the Baghdad school  Ikhshīdiyya -  followed modifications by Abu Yaqub Yusuf al-Shahham, who adopted the idea of "acquisition" (kasb, iktisab), applied it only to involuntary human actions, God-being, in their view, in no way the "cause" of free human actions; for al-Jubbai, on the contrary, God retains Supreme Power even over the actions which man performs freely.  But, unlike the later Ashari notion, Al-Jubba'i refuses to apply the theory of the kasb to free actions; and he calls man the "creator" (Khalik) of his actions, in the sense that man acts, or his actions proceed from him, with a determination (Qadar) which comes from God.  Al-Jubbai had two pupils who later became celebrated 1) his son Abu Hashim and 2) Abu'l-Hasan al-Ash'ari who, after breaking away, was to devote himself to refuting Mu'tazila and to become the "founder" of the so-called school of the Ashariyya. The traditions of the ilm al-kalam take pleasure in recounting the dialogue reputed to have brought Al-Ashari and his teacher into conflict on the subject of the fate of the "three brothers"-one pious, one impious and one who died infans.  In this issue was posed the problem of the rational justification of the divine Decree.  Al-Jubbai was unable to reply with a coherent answer and al-Ashari left him to start his own school.

2. the Basra School  Bahshamiyya - see below

Bahshamiyya ascendance
The Basra school was led by Abū 'Alī al-Jubbā'ī and his son Abū Hāshim.  Students and followers of Abû Hâshim formed a sub-school known as the Bahshamiyya.  The most noteworthy practitioners were:

1. Abū 'Alī ibn Khallād

2. Abū 'Abd Allāh al-Basrī

3. Abū Ishāq ibn 'Ayyāsh

Abd al-Jabbār al-Hamadānī, a judge, was a student of Abû 'Abd Allâh and Abû Ishâq and a very prolific author of Mu'tazili doctrine. One of Abd al-Jabbâr's own students, Abu'l Husayn al-Basrī, was once thought to establish the last creative school of thought among the Mu'tazila - Husayniyya Mu'tazila.

Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila and Judaism
In Judaism (Rabbanite and Karaite) Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila was adopted in Sura and Pumbeditha Academies of Babylon, in varying degrees, from the 9th century onwards.  Jewish Gaonim composed works which reflected Mu'tazila influence as well as translated many of the Arabic Mu'tazila texts into Hebrew (i.e. Yûsuf al-Basîr's al-Kitâb al-Muhtawî and Kitâb al-Tamyîz).  The influence of Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila quickly became central to Jewish religious and intellectual life in the East - slowly migrating across North Africa with the Fatmimids and making it way to al-Andalus.  Gaonim who embraced Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila included Samuel ben Hofni Gaon who was familiar with the works of Ibn Khallâd and Abû 'Abd Allâh al-Basrî as well as Saadiah Gaon.

Mu'tazilî doctrines and terminology provided a basis for discussion and polemical exchanges between Jewish and Shi'a scholars.  Virtually banned from Sunnî Islam, Mu'tazila doctrine remains an integral part of Islamic intellectual history.  The rationalistic approach of Mu'tazila towards reasoned theological issues led to the classification of Mu'tazilîs as freethinkers within Islam who had been deeply influenced by Greek philosophical thought and thus practiced apostasy and heresy.  A similar attitude was assumed by Tosafists and Kabbalists towards "Jewish Kalam"

Discovery in Yemen
In the 1950s a number of manuscripts were discovered in the library of the Great Mosque in Sana'a, Yemen.  These contained texts by Abû Hâshim al-Jubbâ'î, the Bahshamiyya; they also included 14 of 20 volumes of the encyclopedic Kitâb al-Mughnî fî abwâb al-tawhîd wa-l-'adl of Abd al-Jabbâr al-Hamadhânî.  Further writings by followers of the Bahshamiyya School that were found included Ta'lîq sharh al-usûl al-khamsa, a recension of the Sharh usûl al-khamsa of Abd al-Jabbâr by one of his followers, Mânakdîm, as well as al-Kitâb al-Majmû' fî l-muhît bi-l-taklîf, a recension of Abd al-Jabbâr's al-Kitâb al-Muhît bi-l-taklîf by Ibn Mattawayh.  However, no texts prior to Abd al-Jabbâr were discovered; the same applies to rival groups to the Bahshamiyya such as the Ikhshîdiyya, or the school of Baghdad, whose doctrines were to a large extent formulated by Abû l-Qâsim al-Ka'bî al-Balkhî.

In the Yemen discovery, the Bahshamiyya School was erroneously believed to have constituted the last innovative and dynamic school within Mu'tazilism; Wilferd Madelung and Martin MacDermott discovered fragments of Rukn al-Din Mahmud ibn Muhammad al-Malâhimî's Kitâb al-Mu'tamad fî usûl al-dîn.  Ibn al-Malâhimî was a follower of Abû'l-Husayn al-Basrî.  Examination of Kitâb al-Mu'tamad proves that Abû'l-Husayn al-Basrî's views differed from those of his teacher Qadi Abd al-Jabbar. Ibn al-Malâhimî's Kitâb al-Mu'tamad was published in 1991; Kitâb al-Fâ'iq fî usûl al-Dīn was recently published.

 Opponents of Bahshamiyya Mu'tazila 

Dhammiyya
The Dhammiyya Shia was a Ghulat sect of Shia Islam. The name Dhammiyya was derived from the Arabic word dhamm (to blame).  Therefore, the Arabic name Dhammiyya is translated as The Blamers.   The "Blamers" was used for Dhammiyya Shia because they believed that:

1. Ali was God, and,

2. Muhammad was his Messenger and Prophet, and,

3. Muhammad was to be blamed because he was sent by Ali to call the people to Ali, but called them to himself instead.

Dhammiyya Shia was one of the sects that was considered derived from the Saba'iyya followers of Abdullah Ibn Saba. The sect was also known as the Ulyaniyya or Alya'iyya, named after Ulyan or Alya ibn Dhira al-Asdi, and appear to have been active around 800 CE.

Ikhshîdiyya
Baghdadi Mu'tazili who fled Sunni Arabia to Egypt for safety under umbra of Shi'a Fatimid protection.

Kafuriyya
Indigenous North African Fatimids who were good enough to be recruited and die as soldiers yet excluded from Arab culture and society due to their skin-color.

Ka'biyya
Ka'biyya trace their name and origin to Abu'l-Qasim al-Ka'bi, a native of Baghdad.  He refused to accept that Allah is all-hearing, all-seeing, and denied that Allah imposes his will upon man.  According to his teaching, the will of Allah, in relation to the action of His servants, is the commandment to perform the act; therefore Allah's  will in relation to Allah's own action is Allah's knowledge and the absence of constraint.

Abu'l-Qasim al-Ka'bi also maintained that the entire universe is a composite whole; that anything that moves is no more than the first layer of the physical bodies; that the human being, even if he were greased with oil and seemed to gliding on a sheet of oil, would not be what was actually in motion, since it would only be the oil that was moving.

He used to profess the doctrine that the Qur'an is muhdath [produced, originated—and therefore not existing from all eternity], but he did not refer to it as makhluq [created] - that would be apostasy and heresy.
The William Pepperrell House is a historic house at 94 Pepperrell Road (Maine State Route 103) in Kittery Point, Maine.  Built about 1682 and later enlarged and restyled, it was at the time of its construction the grandest house in what is now the state of Maine.  It is notable as the birthplace and home of Sir William Pepperrell (1696-1759) a leading businessman of the period whose greatest claim to fame was leading the 1745 Siege of Louisbourg during King George's War. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Description and history
The Pepperrell House is located on the south side of Pepperrell Road, just east of Bellamy Lane, and faces south toward Pepperrell Cove on the Piscataqua River.  It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboard siding.  Both front (water-facing) and rear (street-facing) facades are four bays wide, with an entrance in one of the central bays.  The building corners are pilastered, and the entrances have flanking pilasters and are topped by gabled pediments.  Above the street-facing entrance is a round-arch window.

The house was built about 1682 for William Pepperrell (d. 1733), a fisherman who moved to the area in 1680 and married the daughter of John Bray, a local merchant and shipwright.  Pepperrell joined his father-in-law in business, and by 1695 owned most of Kittery Point.  By the early 18th century he was one of the wealthiest men in New England.  His son, also named William, was active in the family business, and joined the local militia, rising to command the entire militia of the Massachusetts District of Maine.  When King George's War broke out in 1744, Pepperrell was chosen to lead a colonial expedition to take the French Fortress Louisbourg on what is now Cape Breton Island.  For leading the capture of this strategic fortification, Pepperrell was awarded a baronetcy by King George II.  Pepperrell's large landholdings were lost by his grandson, who remained Loyal during the American Revolutionary War and fled to England, resulting in the confiscation of the estate by the state.
Guido Burgstaller (born 29 April 1989) is an Austrian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Rapid Wien.

Club career

Cardiff City
On 23 May 2014, Burgstaller joined Cardiff City on a three-year deal as Ole Gunnar Solskjær's second signing of the summer, after Javi Guerra. Burgstaller said "My decision to join Cardiff City was never in question when the club first contacted me, it has always been a dream for me to play in this country. I've followed Cardiff in the Premier League last season and I'm very proud and honoured to be given the chance to wear the Cardiff City jersey – I'm a big admirer of the passion of the fans."

He made his debut in the Championship on 8 August, replacing Kenwyne Jones for the last 20 minutes of a 1–1 draw at Blackburn Rovers on the opening day of the season. Five days later, he scored within four minutes of his first start as Cardiff won 2–1 away to Coventry City in the first round of the League Cup.

Averyanov (masculine) or Averyanova (feminine) is a Russian last name.

There are two theories regarding the origins of this last name. According to the first one, it is a form of the last name Averkiyev and derives from the Russian male first name Averky, one of the forms of which is "Averyan". However, it is also possible that this last name derives from "Averyan", a corruption of the name Valerian.

The 1833 United States Senate special election in New York was held on January 4, 1833, by the New York State Legislature to elect a U.S. Senator (Class 3) to represent the State of New York in the United States Senate.

Background
William L. Marcy had been elected in 1831 to this seat. In November 1832, Marcy was elected Governor, and upon taking office resigned his Senate seat on January 1, 1833.

At the State election in November 1832, a very large Jacksonian-Democratic majority was elected to the Assembly, and six of the eight State Senators elected were Jacksonian Democrats. The 56th New York State Legislature met from January 1 to April 30, 1833, at Albany. The party strength in the Assembly as shown by the election for Speaker was: 99 for Jacksonian Democrat Charles L. Livingston and 22 for Anti-Mason John C. Spencer.

Candidates
New York State Comptroller Silas Wright, Jr., was the candidate of the Jacksonian Democrats.

Result
Silas Wright, Jr., was the choice of both the Assembly and the Senate, and was declared elected.

Aftermath
Wright took his seat on January 14, 1833, was re-elected twice (in 1837 and 1843) and remained in office until November 1844 when he resigned after his election as Governor of New York.

Comptroller Wright's election to the U.S. Senate produced a shuffle in the State's administration: Secretary of State Azariah C. Flagg succeeded Wright as Comptroller; Adjutant General John Adams Dix succeeded Flagg as Secretary of State; and Levi Hubbell was appointed Adjutant General of the State Militia.

It stars Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Bartha, Ari Graynor, Danny A. Abeckaser and Q-Tip. The film is inspired by a true story of a young Hasidic man who was lured into the world of international drug trafficking in the late 90s.

Plot
In 1998, Sam Gold is a mild-mannered 20-year-old Orthodox Jewish man who lives with his large family in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. Sam works in his father Mendel's fabric store while studying to be a rabbi. He and his family hope to arrange a marriage for him with Zeldy Lazar. However, Sam's family is much poorer than the Lazars, and he worries he will be unable to provide for them.

Sam and his best friend Leon accept a mysterious job offer from Leon's brother Yosef and his boss, the Israeli Jackie. Under the auspices of visiting a rabbi in Atlantic City, Yosef sends them to Amsterdam, with instructions to wait for him. While there, the pair are given a briefcase, which Yosef says contains medicine, and are instructed to walk it through customs in New York. Back in New York, after a comment from Maxim, Yosef's muscle, the pair discover the briefcase contains pure ecstasy. Leon wants nothing more to do with Yosef or his operation, but Sam is attracted to the easy money and decides to continue.

Sam becomes a participant in Jackie's operation, making trips to Amsterdam to pick up suitcases. He is paid to recruit other young Orthodox Jews as mules, who implicitly trust him as one of their own. Sam meets the liberal Jewish girl Rachel, Jackie's girlfriend, and drinks alcohol and takes ecstasy with the gang.  When Sam brokers a business deal with European drug manufacturer Ephraim that Jackie almost abandoned, his influence in the organisation grows, as does his relationships with Yosef and Rachel, who both take interest in him.

Meanwhile, Sam slowly leaves the yeshiva. His new job, which he originally covered up as legal importing of medicine, is well-known around his neighborhood, and his parents, fearing their family's reputation in the community, kick him out of the house. Sam discovers Yosef has been skimming money from Jackie through side deals, which Sam, fearing the repercussions, objects to. After escaping a failed deal, Sam goes to meet Jackie, who promptly leaves for a meeting at a nightclub. While alone, Rachel attempts to seduce Sam and encourage him to run away with her, but fails to do so.

Jackie, in a meeting with Ephraim and Sam, wants to ship street ecstasy, which contains a higher percentage of other drugs, into America. When Sam voices his objections, Jackie rebuffs him, leading him to have an argument with Rachel. Sam attempts to convince Rachel to escape to Lithuania, but Rachel, having changed her mind about Sam, refuses. Sam then decides to continue with the operation despite the added risk; these drugs, carried by unwitting young Orthodox Jews, are picked up by drug-sniffing dogs and the mules are arrested.

Sam, who no longer dresses like an Orthodox Jew, is not checked at customs with the mules and manages to escape. He goes to warn Yosef, who is high at a nightclub. Yosef suggests they drive to the West Coast to lay low with his cousin. Sam, not willing to go with Yosef's plan, returns to his childhood home in a panic. He is greeted there by Leon, now married to Zeldy and studying to become a rabbi as Sam was once intended to. Sam, realising that he will be arrested, weeps on his front steps as the sirens in the distance grow closer, until a police car pulls up.

In the epilogue, it is revealed that Sam and his Orthodox mules received 28 months in a federal boot camp, where they became informants of Jackie and Yosef's operation. Over six months between 1998 and 1999, the operation managed to smuggle over one million ecstasy pills to America, via Sam and the other mules. Jackie and Yosef receive 16 years in prison on drug conspiracy charges, while Rachel also receives a year for participation. Sam and Mendel are then seen walking and talking during a visitation, implying that Sam has reunited with his family.

Cast

Production
In preparation for the film, Jesse Eisenberg, who was raised in a secular Jewish household, spent time at Lubavitch in Brooklyn, where he became bar mitzvah, and read books about Hasidic life.

Director Kevin Asch said he chose film's title Holy Rollers to reference both the protagonist's religious character and the slang term "rolling", which means to be high on ecstasy.

Reception

Critical reception
, the film holds a 52% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 90 reviews with an average rating of 5.44/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Despite a promising premise and a solid central performance from Jesse Eisenberg, Holy Rollers lacks the depth necessary to overcome its cliched script." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

In a review that awarded 3 stars out of 5, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote the film is a "breathless, enjoyable comedy-thriller" and that Eisenberg is able to lose his "incarnation as Facebook evil genius Mark Zuckerberg."

Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote "Mr. Eisenberg and particularly Mr. Bartha give appropriately twitchy, live-wire performances, and the film tells its basically bleak story lucidly and with touches of dark humor", but said the film feels too familiar to similar films with a "striving-immigrant success story and the cautionary drug tragedy", like Mean Streets and Maria Full of Grace.

Justin Chang of Variety said "while Asch spends considerable time at the outset detailing the habits and traditions of Orthodox Jewish life, there’s not a clear enough sense of what it all means to Sam personally for his betrayal to carry the sting it should." Neil Miller of Film School Rejects criticized the film as "uninspired and formulaic." Writing for HuffPost, Jessica Pilot said the film "feels like it was written by extracting a Yiddish dictionary of every Jewish cliche and folksy latke reference. The story comes as an afterthought."

Actor Luzer Twersky publicly criticized the film and argued its depiction of Hasidic Jews, such as the accents and traditions, were not accurate. The film also received criticism for not hiring a Hasidic or ex-Hasidic consultant to achieve accuracy in its depiction.

Awards and nominations
Holy Rollers was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and director Kevin Asch won the Breakthrough Director Award at the 2010 Gotham Awards.

Holy Rollers also won the Cartier Revelation prize for most promising newcomer at the Deauville Film Festival.

St. Michael and All Angels Church is a church that was constructed from 1888 to 1891 of brick at the Blantyre Mission in Blantyre, Malawi. It is located on the original Scottish mission site, off Chileka Rd, and is in the Church of Central Africa, Presbyterian’s Blantyre Synod. Since 1991, it has been partnered with Hiland Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1885, Lieutenant H. E. O'Neil determined the longitude of Blantyre to be 2 hours 20 minutes 13.56 seconds east of Greenwich by means of a series of 365 sets of lunar observations, and a plaque installed in the side of the church commemorates this achievement. The church has been described as
the first permanent Christian Church erected ... between the Zambezi and the Nile. – Rev. Alexander Hetherwick C.B.E., D.D., F.R.G.S.

Construction
The church was designed, and its construction managed, by Rev. David Clement Scott, who had no formal architectural training. Labor was provided by local men without previous experience in this type of construction. All the bricks used were made on-site from local clay and fired in wood-fueled kilns. It has been estimated that eighty-one different forms of bricks were used in the building. The most common bricks are 12 by 6 by 3 inches, laid up in English bond.

Scott made no detailed drawings before construction began. Instead, each detail was tested with dry bricks before final assembly. The dimensions are approximately 106 feet long, 30 feet wide from aisle wall to aisle wall, and 37 feet high to the crest of the roof. Scott described his plan thus:
The form was a Latin cross with very short transepts, (10 feet outside measurement). A short choir, (12 feet outside measurement), and a semi-circular apse of 8 feet radius. The aim was to make a comely Presbyterian place of worship.

Design and structural elements include arches, domes, and flying buttresses. The two towers are not identical. A Moorish, domed bell tower, which contains a circular staircase, is built into the angle between the south-western tower and the wall of the south aisle. The interior consists of a Byzantine arcade of six arches.

Modifications and renovations
An organ was installed in the North transept in 1907, and electric light was installed in 1912. The organ was replaced in 1954. The church underwent renovations in the 1970s, but has changed little in appearance since it was built. A large crack was found and repaired with flitch plates and turnbuckles.

Surroundings
The church building itself is accompanied by a clock tower, about 30 yards to the north, and is surrounded by additional buildings that at one time housed a school, a hospital,
a printing press, and a carpentry shop. The grounds now include both a modern multi-purpose hall and the Henry Henderson Institute, named in honour of the Scottish missionary Henry Henderson (1843–91).

Gallery
The Weymann 66 was a French multipurpose biplane built for colonial work in the 1930s. It had a low ground clearance cabin, three engines and twin tailbooms.

Design and development
Charles Terres Weymann of Paris, France is best known as the designer of a briefly popular type of aircraft-style coachwork for fully enclosed cars, one of his businesses remaining active as a manufacturer of coaches and buses, but between 1929 and about 1934 the French company Societe des Avions C.T.Weymann designed at least a dozen aircraft. None of them reached production. The Weymann 66 was one of the last, appearing in 1933. It was designed to take part in a competition for a multirole aircraft suitable for policing operations in the French Colonies; the competition became known as Col. 3, and this was often attached to the designation both of the Weymann (as the Weymann 66 Col.3) and to the names of other competing machines. The Weymann 66 was intended to be capable of reconnaissance, including wireless and photographic work; ambulance and troop carrying; and bombing.

The layout of the Weymann 66 was determined by the wish to place the cabin as close as possible to the ground in order to provide easy access. It was a twin boom biplane, with the cabin mounted on the lower wing and with booms and its three engines at upper wing level. The flat sided cabin was a fabric covered, welded steel tube structure. Two pilots sat side by side and provided with dual control, well ahead of the leading edge. The radio operator and navigator sat behind, with the bomb aimer's position further aft. Long side windows stretched rearwards from the cockpit almost to the end of the cabin, which was about halfway between the trailing edge and the tail. The undercarriage was intended to be robust enough for rough field operation: long travel Messier oleo legs ran upwards in front of the lower leading edge to the start of the boom, forming a split axle undercarriage bearing large wheels with their centres (when parked) not far below the fuselage floor. A tailwheel was mounted under a fairing at the extreme rear of the cabin. There was also a wheel or bumper under the nose.

It was a staggered biplane with parallel chord wings of equal span. The wings had twin metal spars and were fabric covered. It was a single bay biplane, braced by N-form interplane struts; the interplane gap was large, with the upper plane well above the cabin top. The booms supporting the tail were steel, again fabric covered and mounted on the underside of the wing where they were at their deepest. At the forward end they merged into the fairings and mountings of the two outer engines, 300 hp (225 kW) Lorraine Algol radials. A third Algol was mounted centrally, on top of the wing and displaced longitudinally so the airscrew discs overlapped. Rearwards, the booms became more slender and carried the steel framed, fabric covered empennage. The tailplane and elevator was enclosed between two large endplate fins of semicircular shape, which carried horn balanced rectangular rudders. Two substantial streamlined struts ran diagonally outwards and upwards from the extreme rear of the cabin to the ends of the booms for support.

Little is known about the operational history of this aircraft, though it seems to have flown in 1933. It did not succeed in the Col. 3 competition, which was won by the Bloch MB.120. Not long afterwards Weymann withdrew from aviation to concentrate on his road vehicle business.

Specifications
Simon E. Jacobsohn (December 24, 1839 in Mitau, Kurland, Russian Empire – October 3, 1902 in Chicago, Illinois, United States) was a Latvian-American violinist.

Jacobsohn was born in Latvia to a Jewish family. He was educated in Leipzig under Ferdinand Davis. In 1872 he immigrated to the United States to become concertmeister and solo violinist in the orchestra which Theodore Thomas was at that time conducting in New York City. Before going to the US, Jacobsohn had been concertmeister at Bremen, at which time he organized a string quartet which became very famous throughout Europe. His musicianship in this capacity was so highly esteemed, that for fifteen or twenty years after he moved to the US, European musical critics made favorable comparison of the Jacobsohn quartet with later quartets.

After several years in New York, the Cincinnati College of Music (now the University of Cincinnati – College-Conservatory of Music) engaged Jacobsohn to direct their violin department. Jacobsohn developed an immense following, leading to the establishment of the Jacobsohn Violin School. Among his noted pupils while in Cincinnati were Max Bendix, Nahan Franko, Nicholas Longworth, Henry Burck, Michael Banner, Miss Currie-Duke, Theodore Binder, Carl Heinzen, Ollie Torbett, Madge Wickham, and Hugh McGibeny.

In the fall of 1887 Jacobsohn moved to Chicago, and many of his pupils went with him. There he established his Violin School and organized a string quartet. He also established the Chicago Orchestral Club, an organization for the benefit of amateurs only; and this orchestra of amateurs gave series of concerts, played important orchestral composition and from this source came the impetus which carried many of them into the professional field. Jacobsohn was instrumental in raising Chicago's profile as a musical center. Jacobsohn also toured the United States with pianist William H. Sherwood, his good friend. Many of the members of the Theodore Thomas Orchestra (Chicago), Boston Symphony Orchestra, New York Symphony Orchestra amid scores of private and conservatory teachers throughout the US were trained by Jacobsohn.

The Jacobsohn Quartet which was here established contained the famous names of Simon E. Jacobsohn, first violin; Theodore Thomas, second violin; Carl Baetens, M. Dr., viola, and Adolf Hartdegan, cello (afterwards Michael Brandt, cello). Jacobsohn and Thomas alternated in playing first and second violin. Jacobsohn considered Thomas one of the finest interpreters of Mozart in the world; and so, when Mozart was played, Thomas always played first violin.

Rest and Be Thankful Hill Climb is a disused hillclimbing course in Glen Croe, Argyll, Scotland. The first known use of the road for a hillclimb was in 1906. The event used to count towards the British Hill Climb Championship.

Descriptions

In 1952 Motor Sport described the course: "The three danger spots on this course which is  long, and rises over , are Stone Bridge, Cobblers Corner and the hairpin bend at the finish and of course there is always the occasional sheep that has to be driven off the road."

On 1 July 1961 Jackie Stewart drove a Ford 105E-engined Marcos at an event here. He said: "it's a special place for me, the cradle of my life in motor racing."

In 1970 Motor wrote:
"The Rest, the famous Scottish Rest and Be Thankful Hill climb, will be used for the last time this year. Like many long established venues, time has overtaken it from the safety angle. A lot of money needs to be spent on barriers and banks and the Royal Scottish Automobile Club who run the National Open Hill Climb there say it will cost far too much; so this year it will only be used by clubs for restricted events and then no more."

The venue has also been used for rally special stages and classic car events. The "Friends of the Rest" are working to revive the course (2009).

In September 2018 a project to establish a Scottish Motorsport Heritage Centre at the Rest and Be Thankful was granted official charitable status.

Veretskyi Pass or Verecke Pass (more formally: , also known as:) is a mountain pass in Ukraine, one of the most important passes of the Inner Eastern Carpathian Mountains.

Location
The pass is located in the Carpathian Mountains just where the oblasts of Lviv and Transcarpathia meet, on the spine of the Northeastern Carpathians, between the Latorica (or Latorytsia) and Opir river valleys and at the river divide or watershed between the Latorytsia and the Stryi. It has an elevation of 841 meters.

History

The pass has been well-traveled for more than a millennium. In 895 the Hungarian tribes entered the Carpathian Basin and during the next century established the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1241 the main army of the Mongols crossed the pass into the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1703, when Francis Rákóczi II came back from exile at Berezhany Castle in present-day Ukraine, he traveled across Veretskyi Pass into the Hungarian Plain to assume leadership in an anti-Habsburg uprising which became known as Rákóczi's War of Independence. In 1914 during the First World War the pass saw heavy fighting between Austrian-Hungarian troops and those of Tsarist Russia. During World War II the pass was the scene of further battles; the remains of the defensive fortifications of the Árpád Line can still be seen today. Since 1980 the pass has been bypassed by major highways.

In 2008, the Hungarian government received permission from the Ukrainian government to install a monument to the passing of the Hungarian peoples into the future Hungary (in 895). The monument was designed by Hungarian sculptor Péter Matl (Петро Матл) who was born in Mukachevo.

Amethyst is a campaign setting for the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, released for both the 3rd edition via the Open Gaming License and the D&D 4th edition via the Game System License. It is published by Dias Ex Machina, featuring the artwork of Nick Greenwood and Jaime Jones.

Rules

The game uses the Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition rules as a base, altering some of the rules to adapt to the setting and include things like vehicles and guns, making magic less powerful and additionally, it changes many of the ‘core’ classes by opening up new paths of advancement via the class focus system.

Additionally the game shares its combat rules with other future supplements of the same publisher and it is meant to be compatible with standard GSL rules.

Races
Separating itself further from the ‘classical’ fantasy game are the races playable. The setting focuses on the fact that the majority of the non-human races are fey, ranging from the short Narros (reminiscent of dwarves) to the various races that are far more elven in appearance, to the gnomish Gimfen, and even the vampiric Tilen. Even the demons the characters encounter are descendants of the Fey.

Technology and magic
The setting also takes into account the disruption of modern technology by magic; the more technologically advanced an item is, the more likely that the Enchantment Disruption Field that encompasses the globe will affect it. Rules in detail are provided for all facets of technological and magical interaction.

Other notes

Amethyst was originally published under 3.5 rules and recognized with an Honorable Mention for Best Setting in the 2008 Gen Con ENnie Awards. Amethyst: Foundations by Chris Dias was previewed at the Free RPG Day of 2009, and then published in 2010 by Goodman Games as a science fantasy setting for 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons. The 4E version of Amethyst was published under the GSL license from Wizards of the Coast, utilizing the Dungeons & Dragons Fourth Edition mechanics by Goodman Games.
Liège Cathedral, otherwise St. Paul's Cathedral, Liège, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Liège, Belgium. Founded in the 10th century, it was rebuilt from the 13th to the 15th century and restored in the mid-19th century. It became a Catholic cathedral in the 19th century due to the destruction of Saint Lambert's Cathedral in 1795. It is the seat of the Diocese of Liège.

St. Paul's Cathedral 
During the French Revolution the ancient cathedral of Liège, St. Lambert's, was destroyed.  After the revolution the former collegiate church of St. Paul's was elevated in rank, becoming the current Liège Cathedral.

History 

The present cathedral was formerly one among the Seven collegiate churches of Liège – St. Peter's, Holy Cross, St. Paul's, St. John's, St. Denis's, St. Martin's and St. Bartholomew's – which until the Liège Revolution of 1789 together comprised the "secondary clergy" of the First Estate in the Prince-bishopric of Liège (the "primary clergy" being the canons of St. Lambert's cathedral).

Origin and buildings

Saint-Germain Chapel 
In 967, Bishop Eraclus built this church. The basilica was raised only up to the windows when Eraclus died. He instituted a college of twenty canons to whom Notger, who completed the building begun by his predecessor, added ten more.

Saint-Calixte Chapel 
The hamlet formed on the island had rapidly expanded, so much so that a second chapel had to be built a short distance from the first one. It was dedicated to Callixtus I, Pope and martyr. The chroniclers attribute its foundation to Pirard, 36th bishop of Liège and added that he established twelve Benedictine monasteries, the only order then existing in the county of Liège.

Saint Paul Collegiate 
It was upon his return from Cologne, where he had attended the funeral of Bruno the Great, archbishop of that city and vicar of the empire, that Eraclus conceived the project of building a church in honor of Paul the Apostle.

First allocations 
Very little information remains concerning the goods which Eraclus endowed the college with twenty canons which he had created. It seems, however, that the bishop gave the tithes of the church of  (canton of Glons): what is certain is that the collation of this church, which was erected as a parish around 1200, belonged to the chapter of St. Paul until it was suppressed by the French on 27 November 1797.

Notger solemnly consecrated this church on 7 May 972: two altars were dedicated to Germanus of Auxerre and St. Calixte, in memory of the worship previously rendered to these two saints in the chapels which had been dedicated to them. On 21 April 980, the fortress of Chèvremont was destroyed from top to bottom and the churches that were there demolished. One of them, dedicated to St. Caprasius, had a college of ten priests; the bishop gathered them together with the twenty canons of St. Paul and thus brought their number to thirty. All the property, pensions and tithes of St. Capraise were transferred to the new collegiate church, to which Notger gave the bell called "Dardar", also from Chèvremont.

Building

The apse, constructed in the 14th century in the Rayonnant style, is pentagonal. The choir, the transept, the main nave and the side naves date from the 13th century and have all the characteristics of Gothic architecture of that period. Later Gothic architecture occurs in the windows of the transept and of the nave, the side chapels and the tower. The upper gallery overloaded with pinnacle hooks is modern, as is the storey with the ogival windows and the spire of the belltower with four bells on each side. The lintel of the portal bears an inscription, formerly on the city seal: Sancta Legia Ecclesiae Romanae Filia ("Holy Liège, daughter of the Roman church").

First known provost and deans 
Godescalc
The first authentic mention of a dean and provost of St. Paul can be found in a piece from the year 1083, taken from the cartulary of this Collegiate Church. It talks about damages caused in the alleu of Nandrin, property of the chapter, by Giselbert, Count of Clermont, and his accomplice Frédelon. Bishop Henri de Verdun embraced the defence of the Church's rights and in order to safeguard them in the future, the advocatus of Nandrin's alleu was entrusted to a lord named Conon. This ceremony took place in the temple itself, on St. Paul's Day.

A document from the following year attests to the existence of a cloister at that time and that the brothers of St. Paul were called canons.

In 1086, Godescalc instituted several benefits (Eleemosynœ or Prebetidulœ). They were known for a long time as prebends of Wouteringhen or Wohange. This same year, he founded the altar of saints John the Baptist, Nicolas and Mary Magdalene. It's the oldest simple profit establishment we've ever had.

In 1101, Dean Godescalc was elevated to the dignity of Archdeacon of Liège, and died shortly afterwards.

Waselin
In 1106, the Collegiale added to its properties part of the territory of Fragnée, acquired and shared by Obert between the churches of the secondary clergy. To celebrate his birthday, on 24 March 1113, Wazelin donated to Saint-Paul his house with all its outbuildings.

The latter rented the tithes of the church of Wendeshem for a rent of 5 Marcs of good money payable in Liège.

New allocations 
Godfrey I, Count of Louvain, in 1135, ceded the tithes of the city of Weert and its uncultivated or cultivated territory to the Collegiate chapter.

In 1182, Dean Henry donated the parish church of Laminne to the chapter, which would keep it until it was abolished by the National Convention on 20 March 1797. He then bequeathed to the collegiate church the land of Hodimont.

Ebalus became dean in 1185: in the same year, a letter mentions the transfer of the church of Hermalle-sous-Huy, to the Flône Abbey. He gave to the collegiate the church of Lavoir, dedicated to Hubertus, whose St. Paul's chapter kept the collation until 1797.

Pope Celestine III, by a diploma given in Rome on 14 April 1188, confirmed all its possessions to the church of Liège.

Dean Jonah gave the collegiate to the church of St. George's and the church of Verlaine dedicated to St. Remy in 1198.

Foundation of Val-Benoit and Val des écoliers 
Othon Des Prez, elected dean, founded the convent of Sart in 1220, on the left bank of the river Meuse, half a lieue away from the town, and five years later it was renamed the convent of Sart, which was renamed the convent of Val-Benoît, when Cardinal-Legat Conrad, Bishop of Porto consecrated the church on the day of Pentecost. He then had the priory of Val-Notre-Dame erected in Liège, in a place then called Gravière (now La Gravioule) and in Saint-Martin-en-Ile, he raised and endowed, with his own money, an altar in honour of Thomas Becket of Canterbury.

New collegiate church 
The construction of the new building was probably hampered by a lack of funds and progress was slow. The tower seems to have been finished first; in 1275 the dean Guillaume de Fraynoir had two large bells given by him suspended: one, in honour of the patron saint of the church, was named Paula, and the other Concordia, the name of the mother of this apostle. Cast in July 1275, they announced the services celebrated by the dean. The second of these bells, Concordia, was still ringing in the 19th century; it rang the D of the organs and bore an inscription in Gothic letters.

Consecration
Everything leads us to believe that the reconstruction of the collegiate church was very advanced in 1289; indeed, on 11 April, both the consecration of the church and the blessing of the altars took place; solemnities celebrated by the two suffragans of Liège, Edmont, bishop of Courland in Livonia, and brother Bonaventure, of the Order of Citeaux, bishop of Céa.

Floods, fires and earthquakes 
Floods
The coal mines surrounding Liège from the Early Middle Ages, despite the prohibition of digging under the town which was not always respected, digging downstream and upstream had the consequence of making Liège a basin and later a dyke. Despite the ramparts, floods followed one another from century to century.

On 4 January 1374, the river Meuse grew so big that the island's neighbourhood was flooded as well as the collegiate church of St. Paul to the point where it could only be entered by boat.

On 28 January 1408, a flood also damaged the books and jewellery in the crypt, part of the charters, the books, and the ornaments of the collegiate church kept in the treasury. To avoid similar disasters, the floor of the new bookshop was raised and one entered from there by a few steps.

Heavy flooding occurred in 1464. The snow had fallen in abundance for several days before the feast of St.Caprasius of Agen, the rains which followed brought such a flood that on the day after the feast of St. Élisabeth, the swollen floods of the Meuse threatened to invade the collegiate church. The canons only had time to block the door with a kind of dam and had to buy a boat to go to the matins. They used the same means to attend the hours until 23 November, when they were able to go to the services on dry foot.

On 7 February 1571 as a result of a flood, the water rose to a height of 6.40 meters. The memory of this overflow is preserved by the following chronogram engraved on the right pillar of the collegial background next to the jubé. The line indicating the height of the water is 0.84 cm from the current level of the paving stone.
 

On 15 January 1643, the flood that swept away the Pont des Arches covered the Latin Quarter of Liège and caused immense damage. The waters of the river Meuse rose in St. Paul's church 1.35 meters above the current paving stone. The memory of this event is remembered by the following chronogram engraved on the pillar that supports the tower to the right of the jubé.
 

A metal plaque dating from 1926 is located to the right of the cathedral entrance indicating the height of the water at the time of the last flood.  Since the installation of the mud and water drain from downstream and upstream sewers, no further flooding has occurred.

Fires
During the night of 6 April 1456, a fire broke out in the room where the rector of the schools was sleeping. Fortunately, it had no consequences.

Earthquake
On 24 December 1755 around 4 o'clock after dinner, tremors were felt in Liège which repeated themselves a quarter of an hour before midnight then a few minutes later. The 1983 earthquake had no consequences.

New acquisitions 
In 1460, the chapter acquired certain buildings of the Abbey of Val-Saint-Lambert located in the villages of Ramet and Yvoz for 100 almuds of spelt to be supplied annually. In addition, he undertook to pay an annuity to the church of St. Servais of Maastricht in payment of a relief fee.

Completion of works and paintings by Lambert Lombart 

Lambert Lombart
In 1528 and 1529 several works were executed, among others paintings which according to a manuscript are the work of Lambert Lombard and his pupils.

Glass canopy
In 1530, by the munificence of Léon of Oultres, the collegiate church was enriched by the large canopy illuminating the left arm of the transept at midday. This window escaped the ravages of the French Revolution. On the contrary, the one facing it was completely destroyed.
Windows
In 1557 and 1558, major works were still carried out on the church. The first date can be found on the central window on the south side and on the vault in front of the large nave; it probably indicates the time of construction or repair of the windows on this side. The second is on the corresponding window on the north side.

Western Portal
The construction of the west portal under the tower is attributed to dean Thomas Stouten (1556 to 1564): the pediment of this portal is decorated with the arms of coat of Corneille de Berg who succeeded Erard de La Marck who died on 16 February 1538 and Robert who reigned from 1557 to 1564.

Printing workshop 
The name of dean Jean Stouten (1566-1604) is connected with the introduction of printing in Liége. The first book published in the City was the Breviarium in usum venerabilis ecclesiœ collegiatœ Sti Pauli Leodiensis issued from the press of Gautier Morberius, the first printer in Liège.

The present church started in 1289, rebuilt in 1528 was completed in 1557.

The Christ of Del Cour 
After the destruction of the dardanelle erected on the Pont des Arches in 1790, the Christ who had been above this tower since 1663, a work of Jean Del Cour, was transferred there. Since 1861, it has surmounted the interior entrance door.

French Revolution 
After the Battle of Jemappes, the French pursued the imperial army and entered into Liège. The collegiate church of St. Paul was chosen to serve as a stable and slaughterhouse and was therefore almost completely destroyed. The chapter of St. Paul suffered the fate reserved for other religious buildings by revolutionary vandals: after looting the building, removing all metals, destroying the main glass windows whose lead was used to melt bullets, selling at auction the furniture, they installed a butcher's shop for their use; the cloisters were changed into stables.

The calm restored by the triumph of the Imperials was not long-lasting. On 17 July 1794, the Convention's armies returned to Liège and the Principality was annexed to France. The following 10 December, the Executive Board decreed a 600 million loan to cover the costs of the war.

From the Collegiate Church to the Cathedral 

In 1802, the former collegiate church was erected as a cathedral and in 1805 the organs of the old Collégiale Saint-Pierre de Liège and most of the treasures of Saint Lambert's Cathedral were transported there.

Return of the relics 
On 30 December 1803, the Bishop wrote to the minister of worship Portalis asking that the government pay the fees and allowances due for the brought back from Hamburg. These six boxes contained the relics of the Saints and the debris from the treasure of Saint Lambert's Cathedral returned to the new Cathedral. One month later, on 30 January 1804, Portalis replied that the government had decided that the amount of the objects delivered to Hamburg for the service of the navy would be reimbursed but that this service being extremely overburdened by the present circumstances, it could not foresee the moment when it would be liable to pay the effects which were assigned to it. The treasure of Saint-Lambert seized in Hamburg by the commissioners of the Republic who accompanied the armies was largely sold on the orders of the 1st Consul by Commissioner Lachevadière. The sale yielded nearly a million and a half that was applied to the needs of the navy.

Compensation 
After the signature of the Concordat of 1801 and the restoration of the cult, Napoleon had the Cathedral granted a recognition of one million to be paid from the treasury of the State, but this debt was not discharged during the imperial period.

Restitution 
In 1805, in accordance with its promises, the imperial government issued a decree on 6 March of the following year, according to which the factories of the churches were granted their property, which was neither sold nor alienated. This decree allowed the new Cathedral to regain possession of part of the property and annuities it possessed before the Revolution, and on 16 September the Cathedral was given back possession of part of the property and annuities derived from the Cathédrale Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Lambert de Liège.

Translation of Saint-Lambert 

In execution of bishop Zaepffel's mandate, the translation ceremony of the bust of Saint Lambert and relics of the Saints took place on 1 January 1804. It was announced the day before by the sound of the bells of all the churches. They had been stored at Saint-Nicolas Au-Trez.

Erection of the bell tower 

The collegiate church used to have only a small bell tower, the drawing of which can still be seen in ; the chapter wished to construct a spire, seeking to reproduce the shape of that of the one of Cathédrale Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Lambert de Liège. The Cathedral Chapter met on 28 June 1810, to deliberate on the erection of a tower. The following day, 29 June, the Chapter decided to build the tower. to acquire for this purpose the spire of the tower of Sint-Truiden Abbey. But it was not until 1812, following a request from Napoleon, that the tower, with its ogival windows, was raised one floor and the bell tower was installed. The side facing west is pierced by a huge window with glowing mullions. The part that rises above it and contains the bells is built in sandstone from the square towers of the old cathedral of Saint-Lambert. On each of its three free sides there are two large windows with sound-absorbing panels. Its construction was completed at the end of October 1811, it replaced the original structure of the original tower, which until that time only rose to the height of the roof and was demolished in May of the same year. The framed arrowhead that ends the tower rises to a height of 90 meters. It was started immediately after the completion of the previous part and finished towards the end of August 1812. The cross which overlooks it was placed the following 1 October.

The chimes 
The chime of the former Saint Lambert's Cathedral which the imperial government had donated to the new cathedral in 1804 was placed here.

Restoration 
In the 1850s, the Cathedral underwent a major renovation by architect  .

Description

The three naves 

The collegiate church of St. Paul has the shape of a Latin Cross 84.50 meters long by 33.60 meters wide and 24 meters high under the keystone. The transept has a length of 33 meters on 11.60 meters wide. The vessel is divided into 3 naves, 2 low sides and a choir without collaterals. His architect is unknown.

The apse built in the fourteenth century in radiant style is of pentagonal form. The choir, the transept, the large nave and side naves are from the 13th century and have all the characteristics of the primary gothique. The secondary gothic is found in the transept windows, the high windows of the ship, the lateral chapels and the tower. The upper gallery, overcrowded with hooked pinnacles, is modern, like the ogival windowed floor and the spire of the bell tower, next to four bells. The lintel of the portal bears an inscription that once appeared on the seal of the city: Sancta Legia Ecclesiae Romanae Filia (Holy Liège, daughter of the Roman Church). All the red marbles in St. Paul's originate from the Rochefort Abbey, the black marbles of Dinant and the whites of Italy coming from Carrara.

The cloister 

The former chapitral cloister of the collegiate church consists of three galleries freely communicating with each other and opening into the church through two doors, one at the bottom of the building and the other adjacent to the left arm of the transept. Before the construction of the chapels on the lower sides, to add to the solidity of the building and for its embellishment, the cloister was square, and one can see the remains in the attics above these chapels. These galleries built in different periods date from the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The first part of the cloister was laid on 6 June 1445 by Daniel de Blochem. They form the three sides of a long square oriented east to the south and west, the fourth gallery is replaced by the lower left side of the collegiate church. They circumscribe a courtyard and differ from each other. The west gallery is older than the others and its ornamentation is also more meticulous, 17.50 by 4.75 metres long, it communicates with the collegiate church through a door surmounted by a great Christ in ancient wood.

Entrance to the cloister 
Next to the door that leads into the church at the north end of this gallery, a second door opens onto a beautiful gate at the foot of the tower overlooking St. Paul's Square. This charming porch is remarkable for its deep ornamental arches and its curious decoration, partly ogival. It is dated from the Renaissance. This gate, closed by an iron gate and decorated with a central stone medallion framing a high relief depicting the Conversion of Paul the Apostle placed between two low reliefs and the arabesques of the lower panels frame two small low reliefs, one on the right side representing the Nativity, the other on the left showing the Resurrection of the Savior. A series of twelve bas-reliefs represent eight framed heads and fantastic ornaments. Seven niches remained devoid of their statues. The overhanging pinion bears the arms of coat of Corneille of Berghes, bishop from 1538 to 1544.

Chapter Hall 
One enters by the cloisters on the east side in the chapel of the chapter hall. The exterior door comes from the church of the former  located in the district of . It closed the entrance of the choir where it was placed between two altars. This richly carved oak door has two panels, the side panel representing the Liège perron and the top panels sculpted to date and elegantly crafted presenting the two LG letters.

Frank B. Adams (December 19, 1847 – December 29, 1929), commonly known as Yank Adams, was a professional carom billiards player who specialized in finger billiards, in which a player directly manipulates the balls with his or her hands, instead of using an implement such as a cue stick, often by twisting the ball between one's thumb and middle finger. Adams, who was sometimes billed as the "Digital Billiard Wonder", has been called the "greatest of all digit billiards players", and the "champion digital billiardist of the World." George F. Slosson, a top billiards player of Adams' era, named him the "greatest exhibition player who ever lived." Adams' exhibitions drew audiences of 1,000 or more, leaving standing room only, even in small venues.

Adams' career began when he found his aptitude for bowling translated to the playing of billiards. One day when he was 25 years old, he picked up some billiard balls and began to "bowl" on the table and soon discovered he could manipulate the balls with great accuracy in this manner. Largely self-taught, Adams thereafter amassed a large repertoire of finger billiards shots. He engaged a manager and began to give performances, his first was at an engagement in New York City. Later, Adams traveled extensively, giving exhibitions and taking on challengers in cities across the United States and some in Europe. During his travels, Adams performed before the Vanderbilts, the Goulds, three U.S. Presidents, the Prince of Wales in London, and the Comte de Paris in Paris. One of the largest matches ever played of any form of billiards took place at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens in 1878. Adams played using his fingers against William Sexton, the reigning cue champion of the world, who used a cue; Adams won the three-day competition in the game of straight rail.

Early life
Adams was raised in Norwich, Connecticut, which led to him being nicknamed "Yank" later in life. From a young age, he exhibited the substantial hand strength required for finger billiards. When he was less than a year old, he could hurt his mother with his grip; she gave him chunks of bread to squeeze instead. Adams was large for his age, and in 1863, he disguised his youth, and joined the Eighteenth Connecticut Volunteers, with whom he served  for three years, fighting for the Union in the American Civil War. After being discharged, Adams worked as a carpenter from 1872 to 1875, and then became a traveling salesman for the American Sterling-Silver Company.

Beginnings in billiards
 
Adams finger billiards and exhibition work had its germination in his early bowling interest. By the time he was 17, Adams was an adept bowler; he often gave informal exhibitions of bowling tricks such as "cocked hat", "back frame", and letting the head pin remain standing. In a 1913 interview, Adams said that, "[i]n those days we rolled what was termed 'skew ball', similar to the  put on a cue ball in Billiards."

When Adams was 25 he was employed as a traveling salesman for the Derby Silver Company in New York. One day, while he was waiting for customers in a Poughkeepsie hotel, he strolled into a billiard room, took six pool balls over to a billiard table, and commenced
to "bowl". The attention of everyone in the room was attracted by the manner in which Adams made the ball travel. One man asked for the privilege of placing the balls in a certain position for Adams to bowl at; Adams made the shot easily. This started Adams' career as a finger billiard expert. In the next town he traveled to, he hired a table, performed the same stunts with the balls, and added a few new shots. For three months after that Adams practiced various shots each day, and some of the shots he developed during that time became part of his regular exhibition repertoire.

When he returned to New York, Adams met with Maurice Daly, then the "dean of billiards". Daly listened to Adams' story, and said that he was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands. Daly offered Adams a set of four balls, and sat down to watch Adams. After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots. At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained any idea of entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room.

Professional career

International success

As Adams became more involved with billiards, he gave up his job with the silver company. Adams went to Sexton's billiard parlor in the Bowery and Sexton employed Adams at Miner's Bowery Theatre at $115 a week.  Adams sought to employ a manager as was typical of billiards professionals of the time; he was taken on by Billy O'Brien, a well known sports authority and one-time pugilist who managed Dominick McCaffrey later in his career. O'Brien organized an exhibition tour of the United States for Adams. Three months into the tour, Adams reached Chicago, where he played a three-week engagement for Billy Emmett at $500 a week. After leaving the stage, Adams opened at O'Connor's billiard room, at Fourteenth Street and Fourth Avenue, where he played nightly for a year. Adams then resumed traveling, and gave exhibitions in nearly every city in the United States and a large number of cities in Europe.

In 1868 Adams appeared before the Prince of Wales in London and the Comte de Paris in Paris. While in London, John Roberts, Jr. offered Adams $300 per week for one year to play afternoon and evening at his Argyle Rooms. After playing for the Comte de Paris, the Frenchmen wanted Adams to state his figures for an indefinite period. Adams also played for three Presidents of the United States; while in New York he was paid $100 per night by the Vanderbilt and Gould families. Bullocks Billiard Guide said that Adams had earned more than $70,000 for exhibition alone over seven years, which was more than the combined earnings of all other listed billiardists. Though champion players with cues sometimes dabbled in finger billiards, it was said even of such greats as Jacob Schaefer, George Slosson, and Eugene Carter that "their work, compared with that of the Finger Wonder, is like a novice playing an expert."

Public exhibitions

Adams' first major public exhibition in New York was held on January 31, 1878, at the Union Square Billiard Rooms before a large audience; he performed there nightly for a week. Reporting on the first night of the event, The New York Times wrote:The intricacy of the various shots he played, as well as the marvelous accuracy with which they were executed, frequently roused the spectators to an unusual pitch of enthusiasm.... Many of Adams' shots are entirely new, never having been attempted before by any billiards expert. Among them may be mentioned the wonderful "bottle" shot with which last evening's exhibition was brought to a close. Two soda-water bottles were placed at the head of the left-hand rail, about a foot apart, a red ball being placed in the mouth of each bottle. A white ball was next placed against the right-hand rail, directly opposite the lower bottle. Everything being in readiness, Adams then took the remaining white ball in his hand, and masseing upon the ball in the mouth of the upper bottle, jumped his ball to the ball in the mouth of the other bottle, whence, falling upon the table it was carried by a reverse "English" to the middle of the top rail, whence it glided with unerring accuracy to the right-hand rail and caromed upon the first-mentioned white ball, its successful execution being greeted with great applause.

Competitive play and rivalries

M. Adrian Izar
Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards had been demonstrated in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him to play for the championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.

William Sexton
On March 15, 1878, a billiards match of straight rail began that lasted three days at the game  The match was between Adams and William Sexton, then the cue champion of the world, at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens—the predecessor venue of Madison Square Garden. The match pitted Adams' finger billiards against Sexton using a cue, for a purse of $500. The audience was one of the largest that had ever witnessed a billiards game. The terms of the contest stated that on each day of the match, Adams was required to score 2,000 points, while Sexton needed only 1,000.

On the first day of the match, Adams scored 1,110 points using finger billiards. Despite Adams' impressive opening performance, by the third day of the match, Sexton was far in the lead. In Dewey-Defeats-Truman-style, many newspapers reported that Sexton won the tournament, as their reporters left the venue at a time when Sexton had a seemingly indomitable lead and before the match was over. The New York Times, for example, reported that Sexton won the match, though they leavened the result by reporting that despite the prize fund, it was a "friendly match", geared toward exhibition, and that "Adams could undoubtedly have run the game out on three occasions, but preferred to make 'display' shots in place of his usual "nurse" play, against which a cue player stands no chance whatever." However, with Sexton needed only seven points to win the championship, Adams stepped to the table and ran out, making 1,181 points in a row to win the match.

Louis Shaw
Adams' chief professional rivalry in later years was with Louis Shaw.  In 1891 Adams and Shaw disagreed about the format of the finger billiards championship which they would both contest that year. Adams wanted the match to be played for a $500 stake, while Shaw wanted the receipts to be donated to the local firemen's fund.

Other accomplishments
In 1879, Adams was chosen to be the official referee for the championship Collender Billiard Tournament held at Tammany Hall. It was contested by top players Marice Daly, Albert Garnier, Eugene Carter, A. P. Rudolphe, Randolph Heiser, William Sexton, George F. Slosson, and "the Wizard", Jacob Schaefer, Sr. at the newly introduced carom billiards discipline called the champion's game, an intermediary game between straight rail|straight rail and balkine.

In 1889, Adams broke the world record run for successive straight rail points in a match with champion player Jacob Schaefer Sr., in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, albeit with his fingers rather than with a cue. Adams stated in an interview in his later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts.

In 1890, Adams returned to Paris after signing a contract with Eugene Carter to play at Carter's billiard academy for thirteen weeks at 1,000 francs (approximately $200) per week. Afterwards, Adams went in London, under the management of M. Farini, to play at the room of John Roberts, Jr. On a previous trip to London in 1887, Roberts offered Adams £60 a week for six months to give exhibitions, but Adams declined, citing a need to superintend his sporting journal.

Adams was the editor and proprietor of The Chicago Sporting Journal, and the general manager of the New York Sporting and Theatrical Journal. Through his association with the sporting journals, Adams was an intermediary for the issuance of challenge matches, such as boxing bouts. He held the winning stake and distributed the winnings upon the event's conclusion. Adams owned a number of billiard parlors during his lifetime, including two in Chicago—one named the White Elephant, another called the Academy Billiard Hall, and one on Union Square at 60 East 14th Street in New York City. Adams' business cards, in 1877, said, "Yank Adams, champion finger billiardist of the world. Residence immaterial."

Later life

Adams continued to give exhibitions and was still able to perform well into his later years. For example, the New Rochelle Pioneer newspaper reported that Adams gave an exhibition on December 21, 1915, at 68 years of age, at Chamberlain's Derby Billiard Academy in New Rochelle, New York, and that he was "at his best and made some exceptionally brilliant shots in the presence of 300 lovers of the game. While at the table he kept up a continuous humorous monologue to the great pleasure of his audience." In 1919, when Adans was 71, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that he gave an exhibition before a large audience at Lawler Brothers Billiard Academy of Brooklyn.

In 1923, when Adams was 76, the following newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, but he turned up in New York the other day and is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, in the language of the billiard realm, "make 'em talk all languages." That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as "Yank" Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the  world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roomkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die."He died on December 29, 1929, in Manhattan, New York City.

Style of play

Adams played only with his fingers, disdaining the cue stick entirely. He was known for his skill at finger billiards and for the quickness of his play. In exhibitions it was sometimes advertised that Adams would attempt to make 100 shots in 100 seconds. He would always begin by "feeling out" the cushions on the table, as the speed of the tables varied almost nightly, some fast and some slow.

Adams would sometimes accept challenge matches at his performances. For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty of the best players in the city. Adams manipulated the balls with his fingers, while his opponents used cues and were given a handicap equivalent to a 1,000 point lead.

Adams performed about 80 shots per exhibition. He had a large repertoire of practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at the short end of the table, three feet apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand at the head of the table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.

In an article in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the reporter summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.

The public flocked to Adams' exhibitions; often the pool room where he was performing could barely contain the crowd. When Adams performed in Rochester, New York in 1892, the local paper reported that "[n]o man in these broad acres can draw the crowd "Yank" Adams does when an exhibition with the ivories is the card. Last night's crowd was banked up, against the walls, twenty deep in someplaces and many witnessed the exhibition from the table tops and window ledges."
Lewis F. Pilcher, AIA (1871–1941), was an American academic and architect active in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century New York City. With William G. Tachau, he was a partner of Pilcher and Tachau, the predecessor firm of Tachau and Vought. He was a professor of art at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. He subsequently was a state architect of New York.

Biography
Pilcher attended Wesleyan University from 1889-1890, and graduated from the Columbia School of Architecture in 1895. He began his career working for Brooklyn architect Mercein Thomas, then started his own practice with former classmate W.G. Tachau. In 1901 Pilcher won a competition to design the Troop C Armory in Brooklyn, which set the state for his later term as State Architect of New York, in which position he would design several armories across the state. He went on to design the armories in Troy, Albany, Buffalo, Yonkers, and Ithaca.

Through his connections at Vassar, Pilcher designed the nine-story North Residence (1907), renamed in 1915 as Jewett House. The structure is composed of a four-story U-shaped arms block, which frames a quad-side court, and is attached to a rear eight-story tower that incorporates a 30,000-gallon water tank. The structure extensively used steel and concrete structural components faced with red brick and terracotta ornamentation. The high level of decorative work, including crenellations, grotesque terracotta faces and animals was incongruous to Vassar’s restrained red brick-with-sandstone-trim Quad dormitories and was nicknamed “Pilcher’s Crime.” The structure failed to attract donors who would have attached their name and it was instead renamed in honor of the college’s first president, Milo P. Jewett.

His partner, William G. Tachau, went on to a more successful career in the architectural firm of Tachau and Vought.

Athanasios Pipis or Thanas Pipi (died in 1821) was a Greek priest and the Greek Orthodox revolutionary commander in the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830).

Life
Pipis was born in the village of Vuno, Himara, Ottoman Empire modern Albania, then Ottoman Empire.

In July 1804 he joined the Himariote and Souliote regiment of the Imperial Russian Army, in order to support a possible revolt against the Ottomans. Later, in 1821, when the Greek War of Independence was imminent, he joined the forces of Alexander Ypsilantis and participated in the revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Moldavia and Wallachia. In one incident, on 7 June 1821, in the wake of the Battle of Dragashani, Pipis together with thirty men tried to defend against numerical superior Ottoman forces. Pipis was killed together with the rest of his men.

Stork is a brand of margarine spread manufactured primarily from palm oil and water, owned by Upfield, except in southern Africa, where it is owned by the Remgro subsidiary Siqalo Foods.

When it was introduced into the United Kingdom and Ireland from 1920, housewives were initially suspicious of the health effects and cooking ability of margarine. As a result, it required a large amount of advertising in the 1930s to increase usage, supported by the Stork sponsored Radio Lyons featuring the band of Carroll Gibbons.

Stork has been manufactured at the Purfleet works (originally Van den Berghs & Jurgens) in the UK since 1920.

It was with the onset of World War II and rationing of butter that sales began to rise, in part driven by the Stork Cookery Service. During the war, a lorry carrying Stork margarine overturned on the A531 road in Madeley, Staffordshire, resulting in people coming to try to salvage its load. The location became known as Margarine Corner.

Stork was launched in South Africa in 1950. After rationing ended in the UK in 1954, the brand was relaunched, supported by the "Art of Home Cooking" promotion, with the first Stork television adverts being shown in 1955. Stork soft was introduced in the 1970s, with entertainers Bruce Forsyth and later Leslie Crowther, fronting taste test-based television adverts.

West Street Baptist Church (formerly Zion Chapel) is a Baptist church in East Grinstead, a town in the district of Mid Sussex, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex.  Founded in 1810 as a chapel linked to the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, it was the first Nonconformist place of worship in East Grinstead; the town's subsequent development made it a local centre of both Protestant Nonconformity and alternative religions.  The red-brick building is still used by a Baptist community, and is protected as a Grade II listed building.

History
East Grinstead was founded during or before the 13th century: little is known of its early history.  It officially became a market town in 1247 when it was granted a charter, but a market existed before this.  Standing on an isolated hilltop site in the Weald, away from the main timber-producing and ironworking areas which drove the local economy in the medieval period, it grew slowly over the next few centuries.

The north of Sussex developed a strong tradition of Nonconformism and Protestant dissent in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.  In 1676, 27% of the population of Ifield, a few miles west of East Grinstead, worshipped outside the communion of the Established Church of England; one of the world's first Quaker meeting houses was founded there in that year.  Baptist worship was prevalent in nearby Horsham, and members of the town's congregation travelled to Turners Hill, West Hoathly and other villages around East Grinstead to minister.  In 1676, 28 Nonconformists (representing 3.5% of the adult population) were recorded in East Grinstead, although no Baptist meetings were documented.

The completion in 1770 of the London–Brighton turnpike stimulated rapid growth in parts of Sussex in the late 18th century.  Although East Grinstead was not on the road, its population grew steadily and it became increasingly important economically.  By 1801, more than 2,600 people lived in the town.  Nonconformist religious views continued to prosper locally, and in 1810 the town's first non-Anglican church was established.  Zion Chapel was linked to the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, a small evangelical Calvinist denomination started in 1783 by Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon.  John Burt, a rich merchant from nearby Forest Row, founded the church: he provided the money to build it, and on 2 July 1810 his sons laid the foundation stone.  Construction work continued until the following year, and the church was officially opened on 23 April 1811.  Prominent preacher Rowland Hill spoke at the inaugural service.

In May 1811, a Sunday school was started at the church.  It was the first in the area and catered for more than 100 children.  By the following year, four times this number attended, and the church itself was also expanding: galleries were added inside to accommodate 200 more worshippers.  In 1813, a manse was built next to the church, and further structural alterations were made in 1862 (when a classroom and vestry were built on to the church) and 1880, when the building was reordered and repaired.  A tiny burial ground stood in front of the church in its early years; the last burial was in 1846.

Members of Zion Chapel established a daughter church in nearby Turners Hill in 1824.  It was rebuilt in 1906 but was still part of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion; since then it has become an independent Free Church.  In April 1847, a schism occurred in Zion Chapel's congregation: some members left and founded a new Congregational church.  After worshipping in hired rooms around East Grinstead, they built Rocks Chapel as their permanent place of worship; the building held its first service on Good Friday 1850.  The building was later used by Methodists, but it was demolished after they opened a permanent church of their own.  Rocks Chapel stood on Old Road in East Grinstead.

The Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion sold Zion Chapel in 1980.  The following year, members of the town's Providence Strict Baptist Chapel moved in; their former place of worship on London Road was later demolished.  Under its present name of West Street Baptist Church, the building houses an evangelical Baptist congregation.  It is one of a wide range of religious buildings in East Grinstead, which has a reputation for unusual diversity in respect of both Protestant Nonconformity and alternative religions.  As well as Anglican, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormon, Baptist and United Reformed churches (and former Quaker, Christian Scientist and Salvation Army buildings), there are several Charismatic evangelical groups in the town; Rosicrucianism and Opus Dei have a presence; and the Church of Scientology's United Kingdom headquarters is at Saint Hill Manor.

Zion Chapel was listed at Grade II on 28 January 1948.

Architecture
The chapel is a small, red-brick building in the Classical style.  The brickwork is considered to be of high quality, and the building has been described as "restrained and dignified".  The façade has recessed semicircular arched windows and is topped with a pediment of brick, above which is a slate roof.  The later extensions to the side and in front changed the character of the building, and the original railings in front do not survive in their original condition.

Ernest A. Gross (September 23, 1906 – May 2, 1999) was a United States diplomat and lawyer who headed the U.S. delegation to the United Nations in the lead-up to the Korean War.

Biography

Ernest A. Gross was born in Brooklyn on September 23, 1906.  He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and then attended Harvard College, graduating in 1927.  He then attended Oxford University before returning to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to attend Harvard Law School.  While at law school, he met Kathryn Watson, daughter of Sen. James Eli Watson (R—IN); the couple were married in 1933.

After graduating from law school, in 1931, Gross joined the United States Department of State as a legal adviser.  Two years later, in 1933, he joined the National Recovery Administration, although he stayed for only a year before he moved on to become counsel to the National Association of Manufacturers.  He returned to government service in 1940 when he became associate counsel of the National Labor Relations Board.

With the United States' entry into World War II, in 1943 Gross was commissioned as a captain in the United States Army.  (He was later promoted to lieutenant colonel.)  In the Army, Gross served as chief of the economic section of the Civil Affairs Division of the General Staff of the United States Department of War.

After the war, Gross rejoined the State Department, serving as Legal Adviser of the Department of State and as deputy to the Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas (Gen. John H. Hilldring, then, from 1947, Charles E. Saltzman). In 1948, Gross signed the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on behalf of the United States.  From March through October 1949, Gross was the Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs.
On October 11, 1949, United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Gross as the United States' deputy delegate to the United Nations.  Only two months later, the chief delegate, Warren Austin, took a leave of absence, and Gross took over as acting head of the U.S. delegation to the U.N.  The major issue facing the United Nations at that time was the Soviet Union's proposal that, with the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War, the Communist People's Republic of China should replace the Republic of China on the United Nations Security Council.  On January 13, 1950, the Soviet delegate, Jacov Malik, walked out of the Security Council in protest.  Malik remained absent for several months, and as such the Soviet Union failed to exercise its veto power to block United Nations Security Council Resolution 82, which condemned North Korea at the beginning of the Korean War; on behalf of the U.S., Gross voted in favor of the resolution.  In fall 1950, Warren Austin returned from his leave of absence, and Gross continued to serve as Austin's deputy until 1953.

In 1953, Gross joined the law firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle; he would remain associated with the firm for the rest of his life.  During the Army–McCarthy hearings, Gross represented Ralph Bunche, who was called before the committee, and Dag Hammarskjöld, who was threatened with being called before the committee.  Beginning in 1959, Gross assisted the Tibetan government in exile and its leader the Fourteenth Dalai Lama as a lobbyist representing Tibet for the debate and vote about Tibet in the fall 1959 session of the United Nations. He advised on preparation of a Tibetan constitution. He authored "Tibetans Plan for Tomorrow" in Foreign Affairs, October 1960. Gross achieved notoriety as a lawyer later his career when in the 1960s he brought a suit in the World Court challenging South Africa's policy of apartheid.

Gross was also active in the international affairs activities of the ecumenical movement.  He was a member of the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs of the World Council of Churches (CCIA/WCC) and he chaired the Department of International Affairs of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA (DIA/NCCCUSA) from 1954 to 1958. In that capacity he also chaired the NCCCUSA's Fifth World Order Study Conference on the Churches and World Order, in Cleveland, Ohio, 18–21 November 1958.

Gross died on May 2, 1999, at his home in New York City.  He was 92 years old.
Trophonopsis muricata is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Muricidae, the murex snails or rock snails.

Description
The size of an adult shell varies between 10 mm and 20 mm. The narrow, conical shell has seven or eight tumid whorls, crossed by numerous transverse ribs (15 to 20 on the penultimate whorl), spiral ridges and fine growth lines. These ribs are narrow and interact with spiral ridges, forming a deep reticulate pattern with raised tubercles. The thin outer lip is straight, crenulate andshows internal grooves. It is marked with inflection at the base of the siphonal canal. This siphonal canal is long about 25 % of the length of the shell), narrow and almost straight. The color of the shell is yellowish (often with spiral brown bands), flesh-colored or sometimes white.

The ova-capsules are described by Jeffreys as about a line in diameter, with an oval orifice. The contain a purplish liquor together with the fry. The animal is light yellow or whitish. It is eaten by fishes : Trigla lyra and Peristedion cataphractum.

Distribution
This species occurs in sublittoral European waters, in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Black Sea, in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean off Portugal, Spain and the Azores

The Rhenish Railway Company (German: Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RhE)  was along with the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (CME) and the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (BME) one of the railway companies that in the mid-19th century built the first railways in the Ruhr and large parts of today's North Rhine-Westphalia.

Foundation 
The industrialists of the Rhineland and the Bergisches Land, then part of Prussia, sought to avoid paying the high tolls for using the Rhine imposed by the Netherlands and very early in its development, saw the possibility of the new means of transport, the railway. As early as the 1830s committees were established the cities of the Rhineland to promote proposals for building railways.

Some of the members of the Cologne committee under David Hansemann (1790–1864)—a merchant and banker from Aachen—and the Aachen Committee favoured a railway line through Belgium to the seaport of Antwerp via Liege. Belgium, which had been established as recently as 1830, was interested in trade relations with Prussia, which then included most of the Rhineland. Not having access to the Rhine, Belgium was at a commercial disadvantage to the Netherlands and therefore moved faster than any other country on the continent to build a rail network. The supporters of the line to Antwerp founded the Rhenish Railway Company on 25 July 1835 in Cologne. Its first president was Ludolf Camphausen, who a few years later in 1848 was briefly Prime Minister of Prussia. From 1844 until the company’s nationalisation in 1880, Gustav Mevissen was president of the RhE.

A connection with the German North Sea ports was not achieved until years later. The Cologne-Minden Railway Company was founded in 1843 and in 1847 the line to Minden was finished. Connection with the Royal Hanoverian State Railways provided links to other German seaports. A direct rail connection between the Rhineland-Westphalian industrial belt and the German North Sea ports was established in 1856 with the opening of the Hanoverian Western Railway to Emden and in 1873/74 with the opening of the Hamburg-Venlo railway to Bremen and Hamburg.

Construction of lines

Cologne–Aachen–Belgium line

On 21 August 1837 the Company received a concession from the Prussian government to build the railway line from Cologne via Düren and Aachen to the Belgian border, a distance of 86 kilometres. The first seven kilometres of track from Cologne to Müngersdorf was opened in 1839. Two further sections to Lövenich and from Düren to Aachen were completed in 1840 and 1841. This included the 1,632 m long Königsdorfer Tunnel, which has now been opened to create a cutting. The last section to the Belgian border at Herbesthal was opened to traffic on 15 October 1843. There was a grade of 1:38 between Aachen and Ronheide (the Ronheide ramp). Until 1855, cable-haulage powered by a stationary steam engine assisted trains up the slope. The line was the first line linking Germany with a non-German country.

The opening of the line created further connections as the already well-developed Belgian network had two connections with northern France, but the routes to Paris was only finished in 1846, on 16 June from Valenciennes, and on 20 June 1846 from Lille.

West Rhine line and Cologne Central Station 

On 1 January 1857, the Company acquired the Bonn-Cologne Railway Company (Bonn-Cölner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BCE) for 1.05 million Prussian thalers along with its 45 km long route from Cologne (St. Pantaleon station) to Bonn and Rolandseck, beginning its development of railways along the Rhine. By 1859, it had extended the West Rhine line (or Left Rhine line, Linke Rheinstrecke) 107 kilometres via Koblenz to Bingerbrück, where it connected with the Hessian Ludwig Railway to Mainz and Ludwigshafen as well as the Nahe Valley Railway to Saarbrücken and its coal mines. In addition, in 1864 the Pfaffendorf bridge was built over Rhine at Koblenz and connected with the Nassau State Railways in Oberlahnstein. The Prussian state helped finance the construction of the Pfaffendorf bridge and its connection with the Nassau State Railways.

After the takeover of the BCE, Hermann Otto Pflaume completed plans for a new RhE Central Station in Cologne. The station and the Cathedral Bridge (Dombrücke) were opened in 1859. The Central Station was a combined terminal and through station: it included four terminal tracks for the RhE running to the west, while the CME had two through tracks connecting to its line on the eastern side of the Rhine by the Cathedral Bridge.

Cologne–Kleve–Netherlands line

1 June 1860, the Rhenish Railway Company took over the Cologne-Krefeld Railway Company (German, old spelling: Cöln-Crefelder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), including its 53 km long line from Cologne to Krefeld. In 1863 this line was extended more than 65 km via Goch to Kleve. From there it built a railway line in 1865 over the Griethausen railway bridge to the Spyck–Welle train ferry over the Rhine, connecting to Elten and Zevenaar in the Netherlands.

This line gave the RhE not only a connection to the Dutch North Sea ports but also part of a lucrative transit route from the Netherlands to Southern Germany and Switzerland.  On 9 September 1865 the RhE opened a line from Cleves to Nijmegen, providing another route to Netherlands. In 1878 a new station was opened in Goch as a common station with the intersecting line of the North Brabant-German Railway Company (Dutch: Noord-Brabantsch-Duitsche Spoorweg-Maatschappij) from Boxtel to Wesel.

The RhE’s Kempen–Venlo line, opened in 1868, provided another link to the Netherlands, which ran parallel with the Viersen–Venlo railway of the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company from Kaldenkirchen.

Eifel line

In 1864 work began on the construction of the 170 km long Eifel line from Düren via Euskirchen and Gerolstein to Trier, which cost more than 16 million Prussian thalers. The line was completed on 15 July 1871. This gave the RhE a line to the Saar coalfields and convenient connections to the iron ore mines of Lorraine now controlled by Germany as a result of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the company sought to supplement its Eifel line and the planned East Rhine Railway by taking over and the Nassau State Railways lines between Wiesbaden, Oberlahnstein and Wetzlar, now controlled by the Prussian government. However, since it was required to take over the loss-making Nahe Valley Railway in return it lost interest. A takeover of Nahe Valley Railway would have limited the profitability of the Eifel line.  On 1 October 1875 a more direct route was opened from Kalscheuren on the West Rhine line to Euskirchen.

Ruhr line 

The company, which had previously operated only on the western side of the Rhine, opened a route across the Rhine on 1 September 1866 to connect with its Ruhr line from Osterath via Uerdingen, Rheinhausen, the Rheinhausen–Hochfeld train ferry across the Rhine, Duisburg-Hochfeld, Mülheim-Speldorf, Mülheim (RhE), Mülheim-Heißen to Essen Nord (RhE).

It built sidings to the many coal mines in this region, generally free of charge. In 1874 the line was continued to Bochum Nord, Langendreer Nord to Dortmund Süd. In the same year, the train ferry was replaced by a solid bridge across the Rhine (Duisburg-Hochfeld rail bridge), with the ferry wharf on the right bank replaced by facilities for loading coal on barges.
On 15 February 1870 a three-kilometre branch line was opened from Hochfeld train ferry station to (old) Duisburg, which was the starting point of a line to Quakenbrück completed on 1 July 1879.
 
Some sections of the Rhenish Ruhr line are now closed and where trains runs it is mostly used by freight trains, the only passenger trains on the route are the line S4 S-Bahn trains through southern Dortmund. The section of line between Duisburg-Neudorf and Essen Nord is now closed and has been converted into a cycling and hiking trail.

East Rhine line 

The Rhenish Railway Company opened the East Rhine line (or Right Rhine line, Rechte Rheinstrecke) on 27 October 1869 from Ehrenbreitstein near Koblenz to Neuwied. On 11 July 1870 the section of line was opened from Neuwied to Oberkassel, where the Bonn–Oberkassel train ferry provided a connection between the West Rhine and East Rhine lines. The section from Oberkassel to Troisdorf opened in 1871. The continuation of the line from Troisdorf to Mülheim-Speldorf was completed on 18 November 1874, opening a cheap route for the shipping coal from the Ruhr to the south.

The Ruhr route ran largely parallel to the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company’s existing Duisburg–Dortmund line and was quickly connected with many mines.  The coal shipments grew enormously from the start, as the new railway launched its "one pfennig" tariff to compete for the coal business. As a result of coal prices in Germany and neighboring countries fell by 10% to 15%.

Bergisch Land line

In 1873 the company continued its policy of aggressive competition in its decision to build a 75 km long railway line through the Bergisches Land from Düsseldorf to Dortmund Süd via Elberfeld, Schwelm Nord, Gevelsberg, Hagen, Herdecke and Hörde, which was completed on 19 September 1879. This line also competed with a BME line.

The line is currently used from Düsseldorf to Mettmann by line S28 S-Bahn trains and by freight trains from Dornap-Hahnenfurth. Most of the section east of Dornap-Hahnenfurth is closed, although the section from Gevelsberg West to Hagen-Heubing is used by line S8 trains and Regionalbahn RB 52 line uses the line from Hagen to Dortmund Signal-Iduna-Park.

The North Sea

The Rhenish Railway Company still lacked a connection to the German North Sea ports. The Cologne-Minden Railway Company had completed its line on 18 June 1874 from Wanne through Haltern, Münster, Osnabrück and Bremen to Hamburg. The RhE gained a concession for its own route north from the Prussian government on 9 June 1873, which it completed within six years. On 1 July 1879 it opened the 175 km long Duisburg–Quakenbrück line via Oberhausen West, Bottrop Nord, Dorsten and Rheine to Quakenbrück. It connected with the network of the Royal Westphalian Railway Company to Emden in Rheine and of to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways to Wilhelmshaven in Quakenbrück.

Operational lines 
The Rhenish Railway Company’s lines in the Ruhr were not well connected to economic centres due to the relatively late construction, especially since they had been planned primarily for the transport of coal. This explains why most of these lines are no longer in operation. By contrast, its lines in the Rhineland and the Rhine Valley are still vital for rail transport.

Business development and nationalisation 

The founder of the Rhenish Railway Company was the leading banker and merchant Ludolf Camphausen. Also involved at an early stage were other bankers such as William Deichmann (of A. Schaaffhausen & Co.) and J. H. Stein & Co., and later Abraham Oppenheim (Sal Oppenheim jr) and J. D. Herstatt. The RhE was at that time the largest private company in Prussia with an initial share capital of three million Prussian thalers.

Originally the banker Abraham Oppenheim, held almost a quarter of the share capital, and another six Cologne bankers held another third. Six months later, Oppenheim together with the Belgian banker Bischoffsheim held a majority of shares.

To meet the high capital requirements of the railway company, the bankers developed new forms of cooperation such as national consortia (underwriters) and later joint-stock banks. Initially some of the Cologne banks which had acquired shares had found it difficult to sell them due to poor economic conditions and attempted to return their shares to the railway company. Finally in 1840 the Belgian government bought the unsaleable shares.

In the course of Bismarck's nationalisation policy the nationalisation of the RhE was announced on 14 February 1880. At that time, the Prussian state held 42% of its share capital. The Prussian state railways created the Royal Directorate of the Rhenish railways at Cologne (German: Königliche Eisenbahn-Direktion zu Köln linksrheinisch) for the management and operation of the network taken over, with effect from 1 January 1880. On 23 February 1881 this was renamed the Royal directorate of left Rhine railways at Cologne (Königliche Eisenbahn-Direktion zu Köln linksrheinisch). The east bank were combined with those of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company which had also nationalised with effect from 1 April 1881 in the newly established Royal directorate of right Rhine railways at Cologne (Königliche Eisenbahn-Direktion zu Köln rechtsrheinisch).

At its nationalisation the Rhenish Railway Company had 507 locomotives, 862 carriages and 13,572 freight wagons. It operated a rail network of 1,356 km length. The purchase price was financed by government bonds worth 591,129,900 marks. The company was formally dissolved on 1 January 1886.
Ocenebra hispidula is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Muricidae, the murex snails or rock snails.

Description
The length of the shell attains 21.9 mm.

Distribution
This marine species occurs in the Mediterranean Sea off Tunisia.
Gyrinocheilus aymonieri is a freshwater fish native to large parts of Southeast Asia. It is of interest as a local food source and for the aquarium trade. Its common names include honey sucker, sucking loach and Chinese algae eater. 

G. aymonieri is found in the Chao Phraya basin, northern Malay Peninsula, Mekong basin (in Cambodia, Yunnan province in China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam), Mae Klong basin and the Xe Bang Fai River. It is most often seen in large rivers, occasionally entering flooded fields. The fish spends most of its time on flat surfaces, such as rocks, in flowing water, using its unusually formed inferior mouth to attach itself to rocks in stronger flows.

The fish are sold in local markets as a food source and small fish are used in preparation of prahok.

Physical description 
G. aymonieri has been recorded as reaching at least  SL and is the only species in the genus to have 9 branched dorsal rays and 36–40 lateral line scales. The mouth is inferior with a special "sucker" modification which allows the fish to attach itself to smooth surfaces. No barbells are present.

Wild type colour varies from pale grey to olive, with darker markings along the lateral line which vary from a solid stripe with alternating higher and lower extensions to uneven dots. The belly is usually paler than the base colour. Some darker markings may also be observed along the back and on the caudal fin, but  no dark markings occur on the pelvic and anal fins.

Name
The scientific name commemorates the French linguist and explorer Étienne Aymonier.

In aquaria 

G. aymonieri is similar in colouration to a number of other species which are commonly available in the aquarium trade, such as Crossocheilus oblongus, Epalzeorhynchos kalopterus, and Garra cambodgiensis, and is sometimes misidentified as one of these species. It is available in a number of colour morphs, including wild type, gold, marble, albino, and leucistic forms.

The species does not breed readily in home aquaria, although fry are occasionally reported as being found in overgrown aquaria. At this time, no definitive spawning triggers are known. Sexing is difficult, although mature males may develop breeding tubercles on their noses, while females become plumper.

G. aymonieri fish are often bought as algae eaters because they will readily eat algae.
However, as they grow older they desire more meat in their diet. If deprived of proper forage, they may feed off of the body slime on other fish, making them more prone to infection and stress.

The other species in the genus, Gyrinocheilus pennocki and the Gyrinocheilus pustulosus, are rarely seen in the aquarium trade.
The Chronicles of Hugh de Singleton, Surgeon are a series of fictional medieval mysteries written by Mel Starr.  The first, published in 2008 by Monarch Books, is The Unquiet Bones.  
The second, published in 2009, is A Corpse at St. Andrew's Chapel.  
The third, published in 2010, is A Trail of Ink.
The fourth, published in 2011, is Unhallowed Ground.  The fifth, sixth & seventh in the series are The Tainted Coin, Rest Not in Peace and The Abbot's Agreement.

Subsequent books in the series include Ashes to Ashes, Lucifer's Harvest, Deeds of Darkness, Prince Edward's Warrant, Without a Trace, The Easter Sepulchre, and Master Wycliffe’s Summons.

Plot

Hugh de Singleton is a newly practicing surgeon in medieval Oxford, England when he comes to the aid of a local lord who is injured.

The Lord hires him to come to his manor of Bampton, and subsequently to be his Bailiff at Bampton Castle (which was an existing castle in the 1360s).  In his dual role as surgeon and bailiff Hugh is called upon to solve a series of mysterious murders and other crimes, which make up the plots of the various books.

Hugh is also in search of a wife, which imparts a nice romantic subplot to the beginning of the series; he later marries and fathers two daughters and one son.  A minor character is Master John Wycliffe, who is Hugh's mentor, and was a real person, famous for his translation of the Bible in to common English, and for his arguments with the church hierarchy.  The characters of several of the Bampton citizens are also based on real historical people, as the author explains in his book notes.

Counting rods are small bars, typically 3–14 cm (1" to 6") long, that were used by mathematicians for calculation in ancient East Asia.  They are placed either horizontally or vertically to represent any integer or rational number.

The written forms based on them are called rod numerals.  They are a true positional numeral system with digits for 1–9 and a blank for 0, from the Warring states period (circa 475 BCE) to the 16th century.

History
Chinese arithmeticians used counting rods well over two thousand years ago. 

In 1954 forty-odd counting rods of the Warring States period (5th century BCE to 221 BCE) were found in Zuǒjiāgōngshān (左家公山) Chu Grave No.15 in Changsha, Hunan.

In 1973 archeologists unearthed a number of wood scripts from a  tomb in Hubei dating from the period of the Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE). On one of the wooden scripts was written: "当利二月定算𝍥". This is one of the earliest examples of using counting-rod numerals in writing.

A square lacquer box, dating from c. 168 BCE, containing a square chess board with the TLV patterns, chessmen, counting rods, and other items, was excavated in 1972, from Mawangdui M3, Changsha, Hunan Province.

In 1976 a bundle of Western Han-era (202 BCE to 9 CE) counting rods made of bones was unearthed from Qianyang County in Shaanxi. The use of counting rods must predate it;  Sunzi (544 to  496 BCE), a military strategist at the end of Spring and Autumn period of 771 BCE to 5th century BCE, mentions their use to make calculations to win wars before going into the battle; Laozi (died 531 BCE), writing in the Warring States period, said "a good calculator doesn't use counting rods". The Book of Han (finished 111 CE) recorded: "they calculate with bamboo, diameter one fen, length six cun, arranged into a hexagonal bundle of two hundred seventy one pieces".

At first, calculating rods were round in cross-section, but by the time of the Sui dynasty (581 to 618 CE) mathematicians used triangular rods to represent positive numbers and rectangular rods for negative numbers.

After the abacus flourished, counting rods were abandoned except in Japan, where rod numerals developed into a symbolic notation for algebra.

Using counting rods

Counting rods represent digits by the number of rods, and the perpendicular rod represents five.  To avoid confusion, vertical and horizontal forms are alternately used.  Generally, vertical rod numbers are used for the position for the units, hundreds, ten thousands, etc., while horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc.  It is written in Sunzi Suanjing that "one is vertical, ten is horizontal".

Red rods represent positive numbers and black rods represent negative numbers. Ancient Chinese clearly understood negative numbers and zero (leaving a blank space for it), though they had no symbol for the latter.  The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, which was mainly composed in the first century CE, stated "(when using subtraction) subtract same signed numbers, add different signed numbers, subtract a positive number from zero to make a negative number, and subtract a negative number from zero to make a positive number".  Later, a go stone was sometimes used to represent zero.

This alternation of vertical and horizontal rod numeral form is very important to understanding written transcription of rod numerals on manuscripts correctly. For instance, in Licheng suanjin, 81 was transcribed as , and 108 was transcribed as ; it is clear that the latter clearly had a blank zero on the "counting board" (i.e., floor or mat), even though on the written transcription, there was no blank. In the same manuscript, 405 was transcribed as       , with a blank space in between for obvious reasons, and could in no way be interpreted as "45". In other words, transcribed rod numerals may not be positional, but on the counting board, they are positional.        is an exact image of the counting rod number 405 on a table top or floor.

Place value
The value of a number depends on its physical position on the counting board.  A 9 at the rightmost position on the board stands for 9.  Moving the batch of rods representing 9 to the left one position (i.e., to the tens place) gives 9[] or 90.  Shifting left again to the third position (to the hundreds place) gives 9[][] or 900.  Each time one shifts a number one position to the left, it is multiplied by 10.  Each time one shifts a number one position to the right, it is divided by 10. This applies to single-digit numbers or multiple-digit numbers.

Song dynasty mathematician Jia Xian used hand-written Chinese decimal orders 步十百千萬 as rod numeral place value, as evident from a facsimile from a page of Yongle Encyclopedia. He arranged 七萬一千八百二十四 as

七一八二四
萬千百十步
He treated the Chinese order numbers as place value markers, and 七一八二四 became place value decimal number. He then wrote the rod numerals according to their place value:

In Japan, mathematicians put counting rods on a counting board, a sheet of cloth with grids, and used only vertical forms relying on the grids. An 18th-century Japanese mathematics book has a checker counting board diagram, with the order of magnitude symbols "千百十一分厘毛“ (thousand, hundred, ten, unit, tenth, hundredth, thousandth).

Examples:

Rod numerals
Rod numerals are a positional numeral system made from shapes of counting rods.  Positive numbers are written as they are and the negative numbers are written with a slant bar at the last digit. The vertical bar in the horizontal forms 6–9 are drawn shorter to have the same character height.

A circle (〇) is used for 0.  Many historians think it was imported from Indian numerals by Gautama Siddha in 718, but some think it was created from the Chinese text space filler "□", and others think that the Indians acquired it from China, because it resembles a Confucian philosophical symbol for nothing.

In the 13th century, Southern Song mathematicians changed digits for 4, 5, and 9 to reduce strokes.  The new horizontal forms eventually transformed into Suzhou numerals.  Japanese continued to use the traditional forms.

Examples:

In Japan, Seki Takakazu developed the rod numerals into symbolic notation for algebra and drastically improved Japanese mathematics.  After his period, the positional numeral system using Chinese numeral characters was developed, and the rod numerals were used only for the plus and minus signs.

Fractions

A fraction was expressed with rod numerals as two rod numerals one on top of another (without any other symbol, like the modern horizontal bar).

Rod calculus

The method for using counting rods for mathematical calculation was called rod calculation or rod calculus (筹算). Rod calculus can be used for a wide range of calculations, including finding the value of , finding square roots, cube roots, or higher order roots, and solving a system of linear equations.

Before the introduction of written zero, there was no way to distinguish 10007 and 107 in written forms except by inserting a bigger space between 1 and 7, and so rod numerals were used only for doing calculations with counting rods.  Once written zero came into play, the rod numerals had become independent, and their use indeed outlives the counting rods, after its replacement by abacus. One variation of horizontal rod numerals, the Suzhou numerals is still in use for book-keeping and in herbal medicine prescription in Chinatowns in some parts of the world.

Unicode

Unicode 5.0 includes counting rod numerals in their own block in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP) from U+1D360 to U+1D37F. The code points for the horizontal digits 1–9 are U+1D360 to U+1D368 and those for the vertical digits 1–9 are U+1D369 to U+1D371. The former are called unit digits and the latter are called tens digits, which is opposite of the convention described above. The Unicode Standard states that the orientation of the Unicode characters follows Song dynasty convention, which differs from Han dynasty practice which represented digits as vertical lines, and tens as horizontal lines. Zero should be represented by U+3007 (〇, ideographic number zero) and the negative sign should be represented by U+20E5 (combining reverse solidus overlay).  As these were recently added to the character set and since they are included in the SMP, font support may still be limited.
The Huajiying Formation is a geological formation in Hebei, People's Republic of China. Known for its fossils including feathered dinosaurs, the age of the formation is uncertain. It may represent an early portion of the Jehol Biota, dating to somewhere in the early Cretaceous or late Jurassic periods. It may correlate with the early Cretaceous Dadianzi Formation and parts of the Yixian Formation, with an age range between 140 and 122 Ma ago. It contains the Qiaotou Member, sometimes treated as a distinct formation.

Age and stratigraphy
The Huajiying Formation contains the following members, in order from youngest to oldest:

 5th Volcanic Member
 Guohedao Sedimentary Member
 4th Volcanic Member
 Nianzigou Sedimentary Member
 3rd Volcanic Member
 Qiaotou Sedimentary Member
 2nd Volcanic Member
 Sichakou Sedimentary Member
 1st Volcanic Member

The age of the formation is uncertain. Ji and colleagues suggested in 2008 that the Qiaotou Member correlates with the Dawangzhangzi bed of the Yixian Formation, dated to ~122 Ma ago by Zhou in 2006. Ji et al. also suggested that the lower Sichakou Member correlates with the Dadianzi Formation, dated to 140 Ma ago by Tian and colleagues in 2003.

The National Leprechaun Museum is a privately owned museum dedicated to Irish folklore and mythology, through the oral tradition of storytelling. It is located on Jervis Street in Dublin, Ireland, since 10 March 2010. It claims to be the first leprechaun museum in the world. The Irish Times has referred to it as the "Louvre of leprechauns".

Tom O'Rahilly designed the museum (with the collaboration of two Italian designers, Elena Micheli and Walter Scipioni) and is its director. O'Rahilly began working on his museum in 2003. He views it as a "story-telling" tourist attraction designed to give visitors "the leprechaun experience" and introduce visitors to Ireland's rich storytelling history.

Visitors to the museum follow a guided tour involving several different rooms; each serving as sets for the stories and information. The basics of Leprechaun folklore are explained, including what it is that defines a leprechaun. A history of leprechaun references in popular culture is included, such as Walt Disney's visit to Ireland which led to his 1959 film Darby O'Gill and the Little People. There is a tunnel full of optical illusions, a wooden replica of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, Northern Ireland and a room where items such as furniture become unusually large to give the effect that the visitor has become smaller in size.

References to other creatures are included in the tour such as the púca, fairies, banshee and many more. At the end of the tour visitors arrive at a shop where they can purchase souvenirs and merchandise.
Puccinellia howellii is a rare species of grass known by the common name Howell's alkaligrass. It is endemic to Shasta County, California, where it is known from a single population in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area near Whiskeytown. Its entire population is contained in a  complex of three saline mineral springs directly next to Highway 299. The grass was first described to science in 1990 and no other populations were discovered despite extensive searches of the area.

The hillsides surrounding the salt springs where the rare grass grows burned in the 2018 Carr Fire. However the bare, wet gravel slopes of the springs were largely unburned and the Puccinellia population persists.

Description
Puccinellia howellii is perennial bunchgrass, and grows in clumpy monotypic stands of stems up to 60 centimeters tall. The inflorescence is an array of branches a few centimeters long, the lower ones reflexed as the fruit matures. The grass reproduces only by seed, and seed is not produced until the individual is two years old or more. The plants are mostly dormant during warm months when the soil salinity is highest, and the seed germinates during wet seasons when water flow dilutes the salt.

The single population of the grass is made up of several thousand individuals, a dominant species of the vegetation in this tiny network of mineral springs. It grows alongside other halophytes such as saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) and seaside arrowgrass (Triglochin maritima).

Endangered status
Threats to this already extremely rare grass include polluted surface runoff from the highway which is just steps away from its habitat, alterations in the specific moisture, pH, and salinity requirements of the plant season by season, and changes in the sediment amounts entering the habitat by water flow. In this habitat, freshwater is considered a pollutant, because it reduces the salinity too much for the grass to survive; management plans highlight the importance of diverting freshwater away from the springs.

Other threats include grazing by black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), garbage from the road, and random events that could affect the entire population.
Anabheri Prabhakar Rao (Telugu: అనభేరి ఫ్రభాకర్ రావు) (15 August 1910 – 14 March 1948) was a Telangana communist guerrilla leader and is also considered a foremost authority of the Telugu language. He was an Indian freedom fighter, considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries  of the Indian independence movement. He was an intellectual, military theorist, diplomat and major figure of the Telangana Rebellion. He died fighting against the Nizam and Razakars.

Early life 
Anabheri Prabhakar Rao was born to the couple Venkateshwar Rao and Radhabai on 15 August 1910 in a Deshmukh family of  Polampally village in Thimmapur Mandal in Karimnagar District in the Hyderabad State (presently Telangana). Born into a Hindu Yellapu family which had earlier been involved in revolutionary activities against the Nizam of Hyderabad, Anabheri studied revolutionary movements as a teenager and was attracted to anarchism and communism. He became involved in numerous revolutionary organizations against the Nizam. Anabheri gained support when demanding equal rights for the Telugu speaking people under the Nizam. His legacy prompted the youth in Telangana to begin fighting for  the Telangana independence and also increased the rise of socialism in Telangana. While studying in the Nizam College, he was inspired by the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Subhas Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and entered the Anti-Nizam Movement as a student.

Anti-Nizam Movement 
Anabheri played an important role in organising the 4th Andhra Mahasabha conference. He was elected as the District secretary of office of Andhra Mahasabha at Boiwada in Karimnagar, and Baddam Yella Reddy was elected as the District president. He fought against the Nizam and Razakars. On the call given by Baddam Yella Reddy in September 1947 many people joined the struggle. A Dalam or squad was formed under the leadership of Anabheri Prabhakar Rao. The members of the squads burnt the Records of Patels and Patwaris in about forty villages in January 1948.

He was a regional hero who gave a new wave to the revolutionary movement in Telangana. His only goal in life was to free Telangana from Nizam Empire/Razakars. He was known as Karimnagar/Telangana Bhagat Singh

Anabheri died in battle aged 37. In a fight against the Police and Razakars led by Nizam's close adviser Khasim Razvi, there was a fierce exchange of fire on 14 March 1948 between the police and the communist squad in the hills and hillocks of Muhammadapur near Husnabad in  Karimnagar district.

After death 
After the death of Anabheri Prabhakar, the Telangana Rebellion raised high. Every village created youth forces to fight with Razakars.  Not only men, women's also trained using arms.

Later Telangana freedom fighters recognised as Indian freedom fighters, India Government took police action (Sardar Vallabhai Patel leadership) on Nizam and Razakars. The operation, called "Operation Polo", took place from 13 September 1948 to 17 September 1948. On 17 September 1948 Nizam surrendered to the India military. Telangana got freedom and merged in Indian Union. Razakar leader Khasim Razvi was sent to jail for killing thousands of innocent people but later he was relieved and settled in Pakistan.

All the names of these comrades, who died fighting can be noticed on the stupa erected in their memory near the hills of Muhammadapur. There is a statue of Anabheri Prabhakar Rao in Karimnagar in front of Venketeshwara temple. It was erected on 12 January 1994 by then Chief Minister, Mr Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy. Another statue of Mr. Anabheri Prabhakar Rao, donated by BJP leader Ch. Vidaysagar Rao was unveiled in Husnabad town of Karimnagar district on 22 October 2012 by Telangana armed struggle leader Ch. Kamala Devi in the presence of Karimnagar MP Ponnam Prabhakar, legislator A. Praveen Reddy, former legislators E. Peddi Reddy and Chada Venkat Reddy, freedom fighter Boinpalli Venkat Rama Rao.
California Hot Springs is a census-designated place in Tulare County, California, United States. California Hot Springs is  east of Ducor. California Hot Springs has a post office with ZIP code 93207. The population was 50 at the 2020 census, up from 37 at the 2010 census.

History
The hot springs for which the town is named were renowned by native Yokuts Indians for their supposed curative properties. Resorts have existed in the area, formerly known as Deer Creek Hot Springs, since the 1880s. The large Hotel Del Venado was built near the hot springs in 1902. A commercial center, swimming pool and therapeutic center were added in the 1920s. The hotel burnt down in 1932, as did the commercial center in 1968. The facility remained abandoned until restorations were undertaken in the mid-1980s.

Description

Distribution
In the study of denotational semantics of the lambda calculus, Böhm trees, Lévy-Longo trees, and Berarducci trees are (potentially infinite) tree-like mathematical objects that capture the "meaning" of a term up to some set of "meaningless" terms.

Motivation

A simple way to read the meaning of a computation is to consider it as a mechanical procedure consisting of a finite number of steps that, when completed, yields a result. In particular, considering the lambda calculus as a rewriting system, each beta reduction step is a rewrite step, and once there are no further beta reductions the term is in normal form. We could thus, naively following Church's suggestion, say the meaning of a term is its normal form, and that terms without a normal form are meaningless. For example the meanings of I = λx.x and I I are both I. This works for any strongly normalizing subset of the lambda calculus, such as a typed lambda calculus.

This naive assignment of meaning is however inadequate for the full lambda calculus. The term Ω =(λx.x x)(λx.x x) does not have a normal form, and similarly the term X=λx.xΩ does not have a normal form. But the application Ω (K I), where K denotes the standard lambda term λx.λy.x, reduces only to itself, whereas the application  X (K I) reduces with normal order reduction to I, hence has a meaning. We thus see that not all non-normalizing terms are equivalent. We would like to say that Ω is less meaningful than X because applying X to a term can produce a result but applying Ω cannot.

In the infinitary lambda calculus, the term N N, where N = λx.I(xx), reduces to both to I (I (...)) and Ω. Hence there are also issues with confluence of normalization.

Sets of meaningless terms 

We define a set  of meaningless terms as follows:

 Root-activeness: Every root-active term is in . A term  is root-active if for all  there exists a redex  such that .
 Closure under β-reduction: For all , if  then .
 Closure under substitution: For all  and substitutions , .
 Overlap: For all ,  .
 Indiscernibility: For all , if  can be obtained from  by replacing a set of pairwise disjoint subterms in  with other terms of , then  if and only if .
 Closure under β-expansion. For all , if , then . Some definitions leave this out, but it is useful.

There are infinitely many sets of meaningless terms, but the ones most common in the literature are:

 The set of terms without head normal form
 The set of terms without weak head normal form
 The set of root-active terms, i.e. the terms without top normal form or root normal form. Since root-activeness is assumed, this is the smallest set of meaningless terms.

Note that Ω is root-active and therefore  for every set of meaningless terms .

λ⊥-terms 

The set of λ-terms with ⊥ (abbreviated λ⊥-terms) is defined coinductively by the grammar . This corresponds to the standard infinitary lambda calculus plus terms containing . Beta-reduction on this set is defined in the standard way. Given a set of meaningless terms , we also define a reduction to bottom: if  and , then . The λ⊥-terms are then considered as a rewriting system with these two rules; thanks to the definition of meaningless terms this rewriting system is confluent and normalizing.

The Böhm-like "tree" for a term may then be obtained as the normal form of the term in this system, possibly in an infinitary "in the limit" sense if the term expands infinitely.

Böhm trees 

The Böhm trees are obtained by considering the λ⊥-terms where the set of meaningless terms consists of those without head normal form. More explicitly, the Böhm tree BT(M) of a lambda term M can be computed as follows:

 BT(M) is , if M has no head normal form
 , if  reduces in a finite number of steps to the head normal form 

For example, BT(Ω)=⊥, BT(I)=I, and BT(λx.xΩ)=λx.x⊥.

Determining whether a term has a head normal form is an undecidable problem. Barendregt introduced a notion of an "effective" Böhm tree that is computable, with the only difference being that terms with no head normal form are not marked with .

Note that computing the Böhm tree is similar to finding a normal form for M. If M has a normal form, the Böhm tree is finite and has a simple correspondence to the normal form. If M does not have a normal form, normalization may "grow" some subtrees infinitely, or it may get "stuck in a loop" attempting to produce a result for part of the tree, which produce infinitary trees and meaningless terms respectively. Since the Böhm tree may be infinite the procedure should be understood as being applied co-recursively or as taking the limit of an infinite series of approximations.

Lévy-Longo trees 

The Lévy-Longo trees are obtained by considering the λ⊥-terms where the set of meaningless terms consists of those without weak head normal form. More explicitly, the Lévy-Longo tree LLT(M) of a lambda term M can be computed as follows:

 LLT(M) is , if M has no weak head normal form.
 If  reduces to the weak head normal form , then . 
 If  reduces to the weak head normal form , then /

Berarducci trees 

The Berarducci trees are obtained by considering the λ⊥-terms where the set of meaningless terms consists of the root-active terms. More explicitly, the Berarducci tree BerT(M) of a lambda term M can be computed as follows:

 BerT(M) is , if M is root-active.
 If  reduces to a term , then .
 If  reduces to a term  where  does not reduce to any abstraction , then .

Les Acteurs de bonne foi is a comedy in one act and in prose written by French playwright Pierre de Marivaux and performed for the first time on October 30, 1749. 
Les Acteurs de bonne foi was produced by the Comédie-Française but was not a success. Marivaux published it in the Conservateur journal in November 1757.
The play is built on the dialogue the author established with the reader through the mise en abyme device. In effect, the text features interviews with the actors, discussion about the possibilities of staging, and lines from a play that is to be performed. Les Acteurs de bonne foi is the last play Marivaux had performed in a large theatre; it is a hybrid text where comedy quickly leads to confusion between reality and the play, with the mise en abyme highlighting the importance of dramatic illusion.

 Madam Argante, Angélique's mother.
 Madam Amelin, Éraste's aunt.
 Araminte, a friend of theirs.
 Éraste, Madam Amelin's nephew and Angélique's lover.
 Angélique, Madam Argante's daughter.

Agnes O'Farrelly (born Agnes Winifred Farrelly; 24 June 1874 – 5 November 1951) (nom-de-plume 'Uan Uladh'), was an academic and Professor of Irish at University College Dublin (UCD). She was also the first female Irish-language novelist, a founding member of Cumann na mBan, and fourth president of the Camogie Association.

Early life
Agnes Winifred Farrelly was born 24 June 1874 in Raffony House, Virginia, County Cavan, one of five daughters and three sons of Peter Dominic and Ann  (née Sheridan) Farrelly. Her first published work was a series of saccharine-sweet articles in the Anglo-Celt in January–March 1895, Glimpses of Breffni and Meath, appeared, after which the editor, Edward O'Hanlon encouraged her to study literature.

In February 1887, she signed up to the "Irish Fireside Club", a new column in the Weekly Freeman edited by Rose Kavanagh, symptomatic of the expanding field of children's literature during the fin de siècle. 

This club boasted over 60,000 child members during its height, and facilitated the mass-indoctrination of a generation of Irish children into the cultural nationalist movement. She was to become the most vocal female within this club, which moulded her utopian, feminist and nationalist thought throughout adulthood.

Academic career

As soon as she became financially independent, she enrolled in St Mary's University College, (Muckross Park College) in Dublin, and she duly convinced her College Principal to enlist the college's first ever Irish language lecturer so that she could study the language as part of her Arts Degree. 

Eoin MacNeill, Vice-President of the Gaelic League, the main cultural nationalist body in operation in Ireland since 1893, was recruited and a class was set up, with Farrelly (or O'Farrelly as she then became known) encouraging young women from other Women's Colleges in Dublin to attend.  

Through this initiative, a core group of middle-class and educated female cultural nationalists emerged in the capital city, including Máire Ní Chinnéide and Mary E.L. Butler, who, like O'Farrelly, would go on to play major roles in the Gaelic League's development through the first two decades of the twentieth century, as literary figures, educationalists and language activists.

She graduated from the Royal University of Ireland (BA 1899, MA 1900), and spent a term in Paris studying under Henri D'Arbois de Jubainville, professor of Celtic in the Collège de France. She was the first woman to have studied Celtic to such an advanced level. O'Farrelly was appointed a lecturer in Irish at Alexandra and Loreto colleges, and also taught Irish in the Central Branch of the Gaelic League. 

She convinced Mary Hayden to apply for the Royal University's Senior Fellowship, in an effort to challenge the view that female scholars were ineligible for such awards. In 1902, along with Hayden, she helped found the Irish Association of Women Graduates and Candidate Graduates, to promote equal opportunity in university education. She gave evidence to the Robertson (1902) and Fry (1906) commissions on Irish university education, arguing successfully for full co-education at UCD.

Gaelic League 
During the summer of 1898, when O'Farrelly had then finished her second year of study at St. Mary's College, Eoin MacNeill arranged for her to visit Inis Meáin, the middle of the Aran Islands, to improve her Irish. Over the next five summers which she spent on Inis Meáin, she became fluent in the Irish language and in August 1899 she founded 'The Women's Branch' of the Gaelic League, a year after a men's branch of the Gaelic League was established in both Inis Mór and Inis Meáin.  This branch provided the first dedicated leisure time that the island women experienced.

When she returned from the Aran Islands in the autumn of 1898, she signed up to the Central Branch of the Gaelic League in Dublin and soon became a member of its executive committee and the most influential female member of the Gaelic League until 1915. Throughout her early involvement in the Gaelic League, O'Farrelly promoted her women's agenda amongst her influential male colleagues. If anything, this enhanced her popularity, which was testified to when she topped the poll in 1903 and 1904. She was one of the most active and diligent language activists at this time.

In 1907, O'Farrelly became chairperson of Coiste an Oideachais [Educational Committee] of the Gaelic League, having relinquished her role as advising Intermediate examiner in Celtic.  Her chief role was to mediate between the diverging views on educational policy within the Gaelic League and to appease elements of the clergy whilst still campaigning for the promotion of Irish within the educational system. According to Roger Casement, it was O'Farrelly who convinced the Commissioner of National Education, Dr. Starkie, of the merits of the bilingual programme in national schools, a programme initiated in 1904 in 27 schools.

Political activity
She presided at the inaugural meeting of Cumann na mBan in 1914, supporting its having a subordinate role in relation to the Irish Volunteers; she left the organisation soon afterwards. 

In 1916, along with Maurice Moore, she gathered a petition that unsuccessfully sought a reprieve of the death sentence of her close friend Roger Casement. She was a member of a committee of women which negotiated unsuccessfully with IRA leaders to avoid civil war in 1922. 

She was defeated as an independent candidate for the NUI constituency in the general elections of 1923 and June 1927.

Camogie president
Her great legacy to camogie is the Ashbourne Cup. A founder member in 1914 and president (1914–51) of the University College Dublin camogie club, it was O'Farrelly who persuaded William Gibson (the second Lord Ashbourne), to donate a cup for the inter-collegiate camogie competition instituted in 1915. 

She was appointed honorary president, first of the Ulster Camogie Association and then the Camogie Association in 1934 alongside Maire Gill, who continued to chair central council and congress. She opposed the divisive ban on hockey introduced by the association in 1934 and made several appeals for unity when the association became embroiled in several splits. In 1941–42 she took over as chair as well as President of the Association, and briefly succeeded in reintegrating the dissident Cork and Dublin boards into the association before another secession in 1943.

In 1931, a set of medals she presented helped spark a camogie revival in Cavan which led to 25 teams being affiliated.  Further medals for an inter-county match between Cavan and Meath helped start the game in her native county.

Work on behalf of female graduates 
She was also president of the Irish Federation of University Women (1937–39) and of the National University Women Graduates' Association (1943–47). In 1937 she was actively involved in the Women Graduates' campaign against the new constitution, seeking deletion of articles which they believed discriminated against women. O'Farrelly also became a founder and President of the Dublin Soroptimist Club in December 1938.

Irish Colleges and other work
She was a founder member, and subsequently principal for many years, of the Ulster College of Irish, Cloghaneely, County Donegal, she was also associated with the Leinster and Connacht colleges and served as chairperson of the Federation of Irish Language Summer Schools. An anecdote told by Brian O'Nolan deprecating her spoken Irish may have been born out of professional rivalry. She also became president of the Irish Industrial Development Association and the Homespun Society, and administrator of the John Connor Magee Trust for the development of Gaeltacht industry. She represented the Ulster Gaelic Union at Celtic Congresses in the 1920s and 1930s.

Celtic Congress
In 1917, Edward Thomas John, a Welsh nationalist and Member of Parliament for Anglesey, attempted to revive the former Celtic Association under the new name of "The Celtic Congress", thus initiating the second wave of inter-Celtic relations. For O'Farrelly and indeed her closest friend Douglas Hyde, who also took an active interest, the Celtic Congress held much in common with the Gaelic League with which they had for so long been involved: its raison-d’être was to nurture and promote scholarship and culture (albeit 'Celtic' rather than Irish); the congress was in theory to be held annually (similar to the Oireachtas); and its leading members were now drawn from educationalist and linguistic circles rather than the more exclusive Dublin Castle circle with which it had been associated at the turn of the twentieth century. Mary Hayden, Osborn Bergin, Eoin Mac Néill and Robin Flower were among those also involved in the Irish wing of the Celtic Congress. When E.T. John died in early 1931, O'Farrelly took on a heavier administrative role within the Celtic Congress, and in the Breton Francois Jaffrennou-Taldir's words, "the Association was given a new life in 1935 [sic], thanks to Miss Agnes O'Farrelly".

Retirement and death
An oil portrait by Seán Keating was presented to her by the Women Graduates' Association on her retirement from UCD in 1947, after which she lived at 38 Brighton Road, Rathgar, where she died on 5 November 1951. The Taoiseach and President attended her funeral to Deans Grange Cemetery. She never married, and left an estate valued at £3,109.

Writing
O'Farrelly wrote in both Irish and English, often under the pseudonym 'Uan Uladh'. Prose works include The Reign of Humbug (1900), Leabhar an Athar Eoghan (1903), Filidheacht Sheagháin Uí Neachtain (1911), and her novels Grádh agus Crádh (1901), An Cneamhaire (1902) and the travelogue Smaointe ar Árainn (1902). Poetry includes Out of the depths (1921) and Áille an Domhain (1927).

O'Farrelly recorded her experiences on Inis Meáin which would later form the basis of her travelogue Smaointe Ar Árainn. The importance of this travelogue lies less in its linguistic features than in the access it provides to the life of women and children on the island, access that the more celebrated account of Synge does not provide. It is also a document which offers significant insight into the aims and aspirations of O'Farrelly herself and of her beloved Gaelic League: it serves as a platform from which O'Farrelly's belief in equality for women is projected; it depicts the modus operandi used by the Gaelic League to promote its ideology on Inis Meáin; and it reveals the manner in which the League's so-called 'Irish-Ireland' principles were assimilated by the islanders.

Out of the Depths (1921) is a collection of political poetry, composed in reaction to the Irish War of Independence, and it displays how O'Farrelly comes to terms with an Ireland far from her ideal. It portrays the dystopian nature of English power, as O'Farrelly sees it, juxtaposed with the light, spirituality, purity, truth, hope and unity of Ireland, which could enable its future salvation. The overall propagandist purpose of the collection is to offer hope to the demoralised Irish people. Áille an Domhain (1927), produced in a climate of relative stability, reveals a romantic utopianism, and celebrates a return to a harmonious rhythm of life, uninterrupted by the unnatural nature of war.

The Endicott Mountains are a range of mountains, part of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. They are located in the middle of the Brooks range and run some  east–west. To the east are the Philip Smith Mountains and to the west are the Schwatka Mountains. The Endicott Mountains are separated from the Philip Smith Mountains by the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk River, the Dalton Highway, and Atigun Pass. The Endicott Mountains are separated from the Schwatka Mountains by Walker Lake, the upper reaches of the West Fork of the Kobuk River (Kaluluktok Creek), Akabluak Pass, and the Noatak River. The Endicott Mountains are separated from the mountains north of the Schwatka by Lucky Six Creek, Gull Pass, Gull Creek, a portion of the Alatna River and the Killik River.

From south to north the Endicott Mountains present long, broad glaciated valleys with rounded hills between rising in the center of the range to steep tors and aretes. The northern slopes of the Endicotts are steeper and more heavily incised, before they give way to the Arctic Coastal Plain.

Peaks
Peaks in the Endicott Mountains include the Arrigetch Peaks, and highest to lowest:

as well as a number of unnamed peaks over 7000 ft.

Geology
Above the crystalline basement PreCambrian and Paleozoic sediments that have undergone partial metamorphosis . Above these are middle Cambrian sediments and the well documented Kanayuk Conglomerate. The Kanayuk Conglomerate is a fluvial deposit, made by a river in its flood plain, and can be up to  thick.  The Kanayuk Conglomerate began to be deposited in the Devonian and continued through into the Mississippian (early Carboniferous). It is believed to have formed a huge delta almost  long and  wide.
The New South Wales Department of Prisons, later the Department of Corrective Services (DCS), was a State government agency in New South Wales, Australia, that managed prisons, parole and community service. Established in 1874 as the Department of Prisons, DCS was absorbed into the State Department of Justice and Attorney General in 2009.

History

Before 1874 

Great Britain started the European settlement of the Colony of New South Wales in 1788, establishing a penal colony at what is now Sydney. The incentive to establishment the colony came from the conclusion (1783) of the American War of Independence, which forced Britain to find ways of dealing with criminals other than transporting them to North America. The initial settlement at Sydney Cove in Port Jackson involved housing convicts in tents, guarded by marines. Further convict shipments followed, and a surge of convicts arrived in Sydney after the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815. Convicts worked for pay and, where good behaviour was demonstrated, could be assigned to masters. Chain gangs operated from 1826 up until transportation ended in 1840.

In the colony's early years, prisons and executions were managed first by the provost marshal, a military officer, and then, from 1824, by the sheriff.

Department of Prisons 
The colony established its first Department of Prisons in 1874, with Sheriff Harold Maclean appointed as the first Comptroller-General.

Department of Corrective Services 
The department changed its name to 'Corrective Services' in 1970, and McGeechan's title changed to Commissioner. Eight years later, the Wran Government accepted the Royal Commission's recommendation that the post of commissioner be abolished in favour of a three-person Corrective Services Commission.

The Government appointed academic Tony Vinson as the chairman of the new Corrective Services Commission. Vinson implemented many of the Royal Commission recommendations, but by 1981 found himself in conflict with the officers' union, the Public Service Association. The Government backed the union in the dispute, and Vinson retired to academia. The tenure of his replacement, Vern Dalton, was memorable for a corruption scandal that saw the Minister for Corrections, Rex Jackson, sentenced to 10 years' gaol for corruption.

Labor, tarnished by this and other scandals, was swept from office in 1988: the Liberal–Nationals coalition that replaced them campaigned on a 'tough on crime' platform. Dalton was moved to a different department and the Corrective Services Commission was abolished in favour of a single director-general on 9 August 1988. The first director-general was former police officer Angus Graham.

In October 1991 the department was restructured, with its juvenile justice responsibilities being transferred to a separate agency and Graham's title changed to Commissioner.

As part of a broader consolidation of government departments in 2009, the Department of Corrective Services was merged with the departments of the Attorney-General and Juvenile Justice in 2009.  Corrective Services New South Wales became a division of what is now known as the Department of Justice, with Woodham retaining his role as Commissioner.

Gautam Thapar (born 7 December 1960) is an Indian businessman who is the chairman of Avantha Group and is part of the Thapar family.

Early life 

Gautam Thapar belongs to the third generation of the business family founded by his grandfather Karam Chand Thapar, in Kolkata. Karam Chand had initially offered the reins of the family business to Gautum's father, Brij Mohan Thapar, bypassing his oldest son Inder Mohan Thapar. However, Brij Mohan passed on the chance to his younger brother Lalit Mohan Thapar, giving lack of desire and inability to shoulder the responsibility as the reasons. Thapar was educated at The Doon School and obtained his undergraduate degree from St. Stephen's College (at Delhi University). He later studied for an advanced degree in chemical engineering at the Pratt Institute in the United States. Failing to find a suitable job and with US visa nearing expiry, he returned to India.

Business career 

Thapar had responsibility to turn around the BILT's chemical division, which was suffering losses due to management-labour conflicts and shortage of water and power. Gautam showed profits within a year, by scrapping the company's expansion plans, selling off a few assets and trying to resolve labour concerns. The family's assets were divided into four in 1999, with Gautam's older brother Karan parting ways in 2005. Gautam became the Chairman of Crompton Greaves on 22 July 2004.

When Lalit Mohan Thapar retired, he chose his nephew Gautam over Vikram. In 2005, Lalit Mohan handed over the reins of the business empire to Gautam along with his voting rights, shares and most of his personal effects in his will. Gautam became the Chairman of the Group on 1 July 2006.

Allegations of fraud
On 29 August 2019, he was sacked as Chairman of CG Power and Industrial Solutions with immediate effect after an investigation that unearthed a multi crore financial scam at the firm.  On 20 August 2019, the company had stated that an investigation instituted by its board had found major governance and financial lapses in the company. In August 2021 the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing 3 cases of money laundering involving Gautam Thapar and the Yes Bank. Gautam Thapar, the promoter of the Avantha Group, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with an alleged money laundering case. Thapar was arrested by authorities under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on August 3 following raids that were conducted by the ED in Mumbai and Delhi according to a report by PTI. In December 2022, the CBI filed a charge sheet against Gautam Thapar as well as former CEO and Managing Director of Yes Bank Rana Kapoor for their alleged bank fraud.

Non-business activities
Thapar is the President of Thapar University and former Chairman of the Ananta Aspen Centre. He was also on the Board of Governors of his alma mater, the Doon School. In 2010, he took over as the chairman of the board of governors of the Mumbai-based business school NITIE, for a 4-year period. He also promotes golf and is president of the Professional Golf Tour of India. The EUR 1.8m Avantha Masters, tri-sanctioned by the European Tour, the Asian Tour and the Professional Golf Tour of India, is India's richest golf event and synonymous with professional international golf in India.

French Florida (Renaissance French: Floride françoise; modern French: Floride française) was a colonial territory established by French Huguenot colonists as part of New France in what is now Florida and South Carolina between 1562 and 1565.

French Huguenot leader and Admiral of France Gaspard de Coligny  envisaged the establishment of New World colonies as a safe haven for his persecuted Protestant coreligionists. The first such attempt was an establishment in Brazil, named France Antarctique.

A first landing in Florida was made by Jean Ribault, and a second by René Goulaine de Laudonnière in 1562, before moving north where he set up Charlesfort, on Parris Island, South Carolina. Charlesfort was abandoned by all colonists, save one, the following year due to hardship and internal conflicts, and they sailed back to France.

In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière again traveled from France, this time to establish Fort Caroline, in what is now Jacksonville.

The French establishment was wiped out by the Spanish in 1565. With the capture of Fort Caroline, Huguenots either fled into the wild mainland or were killed in the subsequent massacre at Matanzas Inlet.

In 1568, Dominique de Gourgues further explored the area, and, with the help of his allies the Saturiwa Indians, massacred the Spanish garrison in retaliation, but he did not capitalize on this action.
Richard Lert (19 September 1885 – 25 April 1980) was an American conductor of Austrian birth. Born in Vienna, he was the younger brother of stage director Ernst Lert. After graduating with a music degree from the University of Vienna, he took a conducting post at the Opernhaus Düsseldorf in 1910. He left there in 1912 to take a similar position at the Opera in Darmstadt where he remained for four years. In 1916 he married novelist Vicki Baum and that same year joined the conducting staff of the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt.

From 1919-1923 Lert served as the music director of the Staatsoper Hannover and from 1923-1928 he was music director of the National Theatre Mannheim. He was thereafter active as a guest conductor with several opera companies and orchestras during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His base of operations during that period was Berlin and he appeared as a guest conductor frequently with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Staatsoper Unter den Linden.

From 1936-1972 Lert served as the music director and conductor of the Pasadena Symphony. In 1947 he co-founded the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, serving on the faculty there for many years. In 1964 he was awarded the Golden Baton Award from the American Symphony Orchestra League. He died at the age of 94 in Mountain View, California. His papers are held in the collection at the library of the University of Southern California where he was also a faculty member.

Allium roseum, commonly called rosy garlic, is an edible, Old World species of wild garlic. It is native to the Mediterranean region and nearby areas, with a natural range extending from Portugal and Morocco to Turkey and the Palestine region. It is cultivated widely, and has become naturalised in scattered locations in other regions outside its natural range.

Description 
Allium  roseum grows naturally to about  high in well-drained soils, and in Europe blooms from late spring to early summer.

The inflorescences of A. roseum are umbels. The loose, fragrant florets are about  long, having six pinkish to lilac tepals.

The smell and flavour of the bulb is powerful enough to drive squirrels and browsing deer away from gardens, where they are planted as ornamental flowers. For this reason, they are suitable as companion plants to tulips and similar species.

Taxonomy
Allium roseum was originally described and published by Carl Linnaeus in his  in 1753.

Subspecies + varieties
Numerous names have been proposed at the subspecies and varietal levels within the species, but only a few are currently accepted:
 Allium roseum subsp. gulekense Koyuncu & Eker - Turkey
 Allium roseum subsp. roseum - most of species range
 Allium roseum var. roseum - most of species range
 Allium roseum var. tourneuxii Boiss. - Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria

formerly included
 Allium roseum var. cassium, now called Allium cassium 
 Allium roseum subsp. permixtum, now called Allium permixtum 
 Allium roseum subsp. persicum, now called Allium tripedale
 Allium roseum var. puberulum, now called Allium cassium
St Nicholas Church is in the village of Wrea Green, Lancashire, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kirkham, the archdeaconry of Lancaster and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is combined with those of St Matthew, Ballam and St Michael, Weeton. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.

History
In 1721 the trustees of Nicolas Sharples' charity bought a plot of ground in the village from a Jane Whiteside and erected on it a small chapel, paid for by funds they had raised amongst themselves. The church was licensed for services in 1722 and was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on 20 June 1755. In 1846 an order in council added to the township of Ribby with Wrea the township of Westby (without the two Plumptons) and formed them into the new parish of Ribby with Wrea, making it a perpetual curacy. In 1869 it became a titular vicarage. The small chapel was pulled down and on 13 May 1848 the new vicar, G L Parsons, laid the foundation stone for the present structure.

The church was rebuilt in 1848–49 by the Lancaster architects Sharpe and Paley at a cost of about £1,600 (equivalent to £ as of).  It opened on 23 September 1849 but was not consecrated until 4 May 1855. In 1857 the pulpit, organ chamber, vestry, and stalls were added, but the architect responsible for this is not known.  The steeple was added in 1884 by the successors in the same practice, Paley and Austin at a cost of £1,300.   In 1931–32 Henry Paley of the same practice, now called Austin and Paley, added a marble floor to the chancel, new steps, and new choir seats.  In 2007 a fully equipped Community Centre was added to the west end of the church.

In 2007–8, a major extension was added to the west of the church.

Architecture

Exterior
St Nicholas Church is constructed in sandstone rubble and has blue slate roofs. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, with a tower attached to its south side, and a chancel with two short bays. The tower is in three stages and has a south doorway and a polygonal stair turret at its northwest corner. The middle stage contains a gabled niche containing a statue, and in the top stage are three-light louvred bell openings. On the tower is a broach spire with a two-light lucarne on each cardinal side. The windows in each bay of the nave consist of a pair of lancet windows with a circular window at the top. In the chancel is a three-light east window containing Geometrical tracery, and two double lancets on the south side. The west window consists of a double lancet above which is a sexfoil rose window.

Interior
Inside the church is a carved and gilded reredos and a stone pulpit. The east window contains stained glass by Shrigley and Hunt.  The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1988 by Sixsmith, replacing an earlier organ by T. and C. Lane dating from about 1880.

Notes and references
The Little Harquahala Mountains are a small, arid, low-elevation mountain range of western-central Arizona, in the southeast of La Paz County.

The range is northwest-by-southeast-trending and is in a region of about thirty landforms, plains, valleys, and mountain ranges called the Maria fold and thrust belt. The region is in the Basin and Range and three mountain ranges are in a parallel, northwest-by-southeast-trending thrust belt, with two intervening valleys. The Little Harquahala Range borders the second valley and third mountain range, the McMullen Valley and Harquahala Mountains, on their southwest borders.

The range is a section of a water divide for tributaries to two river watersheds on the Gila and Colorado Rivers. An even smaller range is connected north on the water divide, the 8-mile (13 km) long Granite Wash Mountains.

Maria fold and thrust belt
The three mountain ranges and two valleys bordered to the northeast:
 Buckskin Mountains
 Butler Valley (Arizona)
 Harcuvar Mountains
 McMullen Valley
 Harquahala Mountains

Peaks and landforms
The highest elevation in the mountains is Martin Peak at , in the southeast. Harquar Peak at  is located to the central-north.

Granite Wash Pass is located at the northwest end of the mountains; Hope is west and Harcuvar, Arizona is east. The pass contains a rail transportation line, as well as U.S. Route 60 in Arizona from Brenda at Interstate 10 in Arizona, and the route northeast to Aguila, then to Wickenburg, on U.S. 93.

Bouse Wash and Centennial Wash
The Little Harquahala Mountains are on the northwest-by-southeast water divide between two washes. The Bouse Wash flows northwest to the Colorado River; Centennial Wash (Maricopa County) is east and flows southeast to meet the Gila River at the "great Gila Bend", adjacent to the Gila Bend Mountains.
Kepler-9c is one of the first seven extrasolar planets, exoplanets, discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, and one of at least two planets orbiting the star Kepler-9. Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were the first exoplanets confirmed to be transiting their star. The planet's discovery was announced by the Kepler Mission team on August 26, 2010 after its initial discovery by Kepler. At the time, it was one of 700 planetary candidates noted by Kepler.

Observations of the planet have suggested that it is a hydrogen–helium gas giant that is slightly smaller than Saturn, and that it orbits nearby its star at .225 AU. Kepler-9c and b are notable in that the planets share a pattern of orbital resonance, in which the orbit of each planet stabilizes the orbit of the other. During the time it was observed by the spacecraft, the planet's orbit, which lasts on average approximately 38 days, shortened by 39 minutes every orbital period because of this effect. Its orbit, over time, oscillates slightly above and below a 2:1 ratio with planet b.

Nomenclature and history
As with most exoplanets, the name "Kepler-9c" denotes that it is the second planet discovered in the orbit of the star Kepler-9. Kepler-9 itself was named after the Kepler Mission, a NASA project oriented towards discovering planets that are transiting their home stars.

The planet was one of 700 planetary candidates considered by Kepler in its first 43 days of operation. It was highlighted as a part of one of five star systems that seemed to hold multiple transiting planets. Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were confirmed as the first planets discovered to transit the same star.

Initial estimates concerning Kepler-9c's mass were refined by follow-up observations made by the Keck 1 Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Keck was able to confirm that Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were planets that were slightly smaller than planet Saturn.

Characteristics
Kepler-9c is a gas giant that is smaller and slightly less massive than planet Saturn. It is approximately 0.171 MJ, or 17% the mass of planet Jupiter. It also has a radius of 0.823 RJ, which makes it slightly smaller (1.5%) than Saturn. The planet is, on average, situated 0.225 AU from the star.

It is probable that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon is the first of its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase.

The film is strikingly similar in style and plot to the 1988 ATV's The Court Secret Agent (錦衣衛), and the 2010 film 14 Blades, which starred Donnie Yen, may have been a remake of it .

Plot
Captain Zhao Wu Yi is the leader of the Brocade Guards, the government's secret police. The sergeant of the force is Zhao's elder son, Zhao Bu Fa. Zhao also has a younger son in the force, Zhao Bu Qun, whom he executes after he questions him about whether or not he would kill his father if he committed a crime, which he answers "No".

The force works under a childish, womanizing Emperor who is irresponsible to his duties. The blood thirsty Eunuch Wang Zhen usually bribes the Emperor with woman, for which the Emperor gives the eunuch his powers. Zhao Bu Fa has never been fond of the eunuch. Eunuch Wang then orders the Brocade Guards to kill two righteous guards, Yu Hua Long and Li Yi. Zhao refuses to kill them and resigns from the force. The furious eunuch then orders Zhao Wu Yi to kill his son; he sends his men to kill him but his troupe, are no match for Zhao, so Zhao survives every time.

Zhao then goes into hiding with his wife Xue Liang and son Ding Dong in his ancestral village. His whole clan are there and his uncle Zhao Wu Ji is their leader. Things work out fine, until a message is sent to the village ordering the clan to kill Zhao Bu Fa or face execution. They decide to kill Zhao, whereupon Zhao and his uncle engage in a duel and he kills his own uncle. Zhao's sister Wu Xiao Nan, who did not want to kill Zhao, later gives Zhao a poisoned cup of tea; they engage in a fight where Zhao kills Wu, and he and his family escape.

They meet up with Zhao's brother, who reveals that his execution was fake, it was just to show the Brocade Guards what would happen to them if they disobey an order. Bu Qun then treats his brother's poison and later disguises himself as his brother. He ends up sacrificing himself for his brother and family to live a peaceful life. Xue Liang repays his kindness by killing herself. The Jinyi troupe brings Bu Qun's head to show Wu Yi, who is saddened and says that he does not actually want his son to die. Eunuch Wang tries to completely take over the Emperor's throne. Zhao Bu Fa calls for a duel with Wang. They engage in a duel in the mountains and Zhao chops off Wang's left arm, later killing him by chopping him in half. After the duel, Zhao informs his father that he has killed Eunuch Wang.

Reception
In a review for Hong Kong Cinemagic, David-Olivier Vidouze praised the film as a whole, but argued that despite containing the basic characteristics of martial arts films, the action scenes' fast pace makes them the weakest part of Secret Service Of The Imperial Court. Vidouze also praised the cast: Leung Kar Yan for his performance in drama and action scenes, and Ku Feng for a convincing performance as a tortured father. He argued that Secret Service Of The Imperial Court was one of the last great achievements of the Shaw Brothers Studio. He argued that the greatest quality of the film is the emotional power generated by the complex scenarios. It comments on ideas of duty: the duty of a son to his father, the duty of an officer of the law to political superiors, and the duty of a clan leader to the community. The film presents many responses to these dilemmas and forces each character to choose a path.

Tatu Piispanen argued in Elitisti that Secret Service of the Imperial Court was the last absolutely successful martial arts film made by the Shaw Brothers, who closed in 1986, and he went on to say that it was the one of the best of the new wave of Wuxia of the 1980s. Piispanen praised its directorial innovation, sets, cinematography, and music, but most of all lauded the performances of its actors. Despite some idiosyncratic actions by specific characters, he wrote that the film's "superior acting sets it above its competitors". Although the fight scenes were sped up, Piispanen praised the choreography and swordsmanship.

Both reviews mentioned a similarity to the Lone Wolf and Cub films, especially in the large amounts of gore and body parts during fight scenes and the theme of a lone warrior fleeing with his son.

Box office
The film grossed HK$1,376,722 during its theatrical run from 19 October to 23 October 1984.

The 1600th Air Transport Group is a discontinued United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the Atlantic Division, Military Air Transport Service at Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. It provided strategic airlift between the United States and Europe until it was discontinued on 19 June 1955.

History
The group was formed from the personnel and equipment of the 1st Air Transport Group (Provisional), a C-54 Skymaster unit of Air Transport Command (ATC) at Westover when Military Air Transport Service (MATS) replaced ATC in 1948.  The 1st had been organized as the operational element of the 2d Air Transport Wing (Provisional) Under the experimental wing base (Hobson Plan) organization system.  When the 1600th was organized it became the operational element of the 520th Air Transport Wing (later the 1600th Air Transport Wing).

The group became Atlantic Division, Military Air Transport Service's primary strategic transport airlift provider between the United States and Europe in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1953, the group was transferred to the direct control of the Atlantic Division took as the wing was reduced to control of support elements in 1953 in anticipation of transfer of Westover from MATS to Strategic Air Command (SAC). The unit operated large numbers of Douglas C-124 Globemaster II heavy transports, as well as Boeing C-97 Stratofreighters. It provided passenger service on Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmasters and supported VIP transportation for Atlantic Division Headquarters at Westover.  In the summer of 1948, the group's 16th Air Transport Squadron was reassigned directly to the Atlantic Division and in the fall it became part of Continental Division, MATS and moved to Gravelly Point, Virginia where it became a forerunner of the 89th Airlift Wing.

In July 1952, MATS replaced its table of distribution (four digit) air transport squadrons, which were controlled by the command with table of organization units whose organization was controlled by Headquarters, United States Air Force (USAF).  The USAF controlled units were ferrying and transport squadrons that had been assigned to ATC during World War II. Unlike the MATS controlled squadrons that had been formed in peacetime, these units had histories that included wartime actions and could be continued even after inactivation. Each of the new squadrons assumed the mission, personnel, and equipment of the squadron it replaced.

The group was inactivated in 1955 when MATS moved its Atlantic Division headquarters and airlift operations to McGuire AFB, New Jersey and SAC assumed control of Westover AFB.

The Basilica of Our Lady of Humility or Madonna dell'Umiltà is a Renaissance-style, Roman Catholic Marian basilica in Pistoia, region of Tuscany, Italy.

History
According to legend, on July 17, 1490, in the midst of the infighting between local families of the Panciatichi and Cancellieri, some people saw blood dripping from the forehead of a 14th-century fresco of the Madonna painted on a small chapel, which was interpreted as a sign that the Virgin Mary suffered from the bloodshed in the region. The miracle was confirmed by Bishop Niccolò Pandolfini, and the important families of Pistoia decided to build the sanctuary to honor the Madonna. The fresco is attributed by some to Bartolomeo Cristiani, but was perhaps due to a local painter from Pistoia. 

Originally the site had a small church or chapel, Santa Maria Forisportae, outside of the early medieval city walls of Pistoia. Initially plans to enlarge the church were commissioned from Giuliano da Sangallo, but when he left Tuscany, the design was completed by Ventura Vitoni, who began construction of the octagonal church in 1495, and work continued until his death in 1522. In 1563, the Grand Duke Cosimo I Medici entrusted completion to Giorgio Vasari, who elaborated the tall dome. The main altar was designed in 1579 by Pietro Tacca. The church was consecrated in 1582. The facade remains incomplete. 

The  dome was completed in 1569, but its completion had been an arduous and prolonged task, and soon after, cracks appeared in the structure, requiring Vasari to add chains to gird the structure. But concerns about the stability emerged, and Bartolomeo Ammanati was called to create further reinforcement, concerned about the weight of the lantern, to the structure by Vasari. However, for centuries, problems continued, requiring further refurbishments well into the 21st century.

In 1931, Pope Pius XI elevated the church to the status of minor basilica.<ref>[http://www.gcatholic.org/churches/data/basITX.htm Catholic Basilicas in Italy, Vatican City State, San Marino]</ref>

Description
The octagonal layout of the nave is more typical in devotional shrines, typically attended by individuals with a personal request, rather than the linear naves of churches belonging to the friars or Dominicans, where sermons to an audience were more important. The vertical red-tiled dome on the outside resembles a smaller version of Brunelleschi's dome for the Cathedral of Florence].

An inventory in 1821 listed the church as containing the following works:Construction of the Temple by Giovanni Domenico Piastrini (Four canvases in atrium)Cain damned by God by Niccola Monti (atrium)

The children's television show Sesame Street, which premiered on public broadcasting television stations in 1969, was the first show of its kind that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content. Its goals were garnered from in-house formative research and independent summative evaluations, and its first curriculum was created in a series of five seminars in 1968.

Sesame Street has both cognitive and affective goals. Initially, its producers and researchers focused on their young viewers' cognitive skills, while addressing their affective skills indirectly, because they believed that focusing on cognitive skills would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. They sought to prepare young children for school, especially children from low-income families. The show's producers used modeling, repetition, and humor to fulfill their goals. They made changes in the show's content to increase their viewers' attention and to increase its appeal. They encouraged "co-viewing" to entice older children and parents to watch the show by including humor, cultural references, and celebrities.

After Sesame Street's first season, its producers and researchers began to address affective goals more overtly. They addressed social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict, which was depicted through interpersonal disputes among its residents. In the 1980s, the show used the real-life experiences of the show's cast and crew, such as the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.

The show's goals for outreach were addressed during its first season by an extensive and innovative promotional campaign targeted at children and their families in low-income, inner city homes because these groups tended to not watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with them. In subsequent seasons, the producers developed a series of educational materials used in preschool settings.

Purpose

According to author Malcolm Gladwell, "Sesame Street was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them". Gerald S. Lesser, the first chair of the advisory board of the Children's Television Workshop (the CTW, or "the Workshop"), the organization that oversaw the show's production, stated that to be effective as an educational tool, television needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. Sesame Street was the first children's show that paid attention to the structure of each episode and made "small but critical adjustments" to each segment to capture children's attention.

Sesame Street was one of the few children's television programs that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content. The show's goals were garnered from in-house formative research which informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons that measured the program's educational effectiveness. The first curriculum was created in a series of five seminars, led by Lesser and attended by Sesame Street's new creative staff and by educational and child development specialists, in 1968. The participants generated long lists of goals, which the Workshop organized into five categories. Eventually, these categories were whittled down to four: symbolic representation, cognitive processes, the physical environment, and the social environment. The show's curriculum was eventually restated to identify the writers' goals instead of the child's.

Cognitive goals
Lesser reported in his 1974 book, Children and Television: Lessons Learned From Sesame Street, written to document the development of the show and the CTW, that one of the goals of the show's creators was "the fundamental purpose of preparing children for school". They were aware of the "individual suffering and frustration" of the child who was ill-prepared for the demands of school, so they sought to instill in their young viewers an appetite for learning. Two related goals were providing their viewers with basic educational skills, which Lesser insisted was valuable to inner-city parents, and teaching children both what and how to think. The show's creators decided to only include in their curriculum the range of skills of the three to five-year-old child, and not focus on skills they already had, or on skills beyond their reach.

Sesame Street's creators recognized that television lent itself well to the use of modelling as a teaching tool. They understood that children tended to imitate what they saw on the screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective verbal communication. Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well. One of the positive behaviors they modeled was inquisitiveness and the enjoyment of learning. If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.

The creators of Sesame Street believed that young children were easily distracted by peripheral details and were unable to selectively attend to the most useful aspects of what they observed, so they gave special care to, as Lesser put it, "make salient what the child is expected to learn". They eliminated irrelevant and distracting content without making the content uninteresting, especially in repeated viewings. The content they presented had to compete with the distractions that occurred as a result of viewing at home, so they realized that the show had to have high appeal. They found, however, that the relationship between appeal and comprehension was more complicated than they initially thought, and discovered that young children probably did not attend to material that was presented at a higher level than they were ready to understand. The Workshop's researchers found that by crafting the show's segments, children's verbal participation and interaction could be increased, which addressed their critics' concerns about children's passivity while watching television.

Repetition was a convention used often on Sesame Street. The creators understood that repetition gave young children opportunities to practice new skills and assisted them in making a connection between new and unfamiliar concepts. They observed that children seemed to enjoy some material more after viewing them several times, and allowed them to predict and anticipate the outcome of a sequence. Repetition made it easier to teach complex concepts or situations a child would not be able to comprehend from a single viewing, and allowed children to explore different facets of a subject. In the early years of Sesame Street, the producers took advantage of repetition as an effective teaching tool by often repeating the same segment many times during the course of an episode; in the first ten seasons, one in six segments was a repeat of an earlier one. The Workshop also learned that varying the details while repeating the same format was also an effective use of repetition.

Television historian Robert W. Morrow saw what he called "the often repeated alphabet recitation segment" as an example of the show's use of repetition. For example, in a short film in which actor James Earl Jones recited the alphabet, Jones made long pauses before each letter, which were superimposed in a corner of the screen moments before he said it. According to Cooney, some educational advisors recommended against using Jones, thinking that he would frighten young viewers, but children ended up loving his segments. The producers found that children who had seen the segment a few times said the letter before Jones did, and Jones often served as confirmation or correction. The producers viewed this as a way to make television more interactive, and dubbed it "the James Earl Jones effect".

Humor was used on Sesame Street to both attract the attention of its young viewers and to, as Lesser put it, "entice parents and older siblings to share the young child's viewing", called "coviewing" by Truglio and Fisch. Jim Henson's characters and humor were instrumental in creating the show's "two-tiered audience" of younger and older viewers. Lesser went so far as to state that educational television was "completely dependent upon the effective use of humor". Lesser also stated that in order for comedy to be an effective teaching tool, it had to coincide with the lesson being taught. Although critics complained that slapstick was too violent for children's television, the Workshop found that it was the most effective comedy form they used, and as Lesser said, "a favorite with preschoolers". Morrow reported that the only violence depicted on Sesame Street was "slapstick punctuation", and that it was used only in animations and short films.

Another way the Workshop encouraged co-viewing was through the use of cultural references that only adults would understand. Celebrities familiar to adults and older children also appeared on the show. Cooney's previous documentary production experience and producer Dave Connell's "wide ranging contacts in the media" resulted in successful bookings of celebrities on the show, even before the show became successful. As of 2009, over 500 celebrities had appeared on Sesame Street.

Affective goals
At first, the creators of Sesame Street addressed "affective goals" indirectly, believing that focusing on cognitive and educational goals would naturally increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. Their viewers' racial identities were addressed by integrating the show with, at first, black and white actors and performers. Eventually their critics during the show's first season forced the Workshop to address affective goals more overtly, which occurred after "extensive research and planning". The affective goals they addressed were social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict, which was depicted through interpersonal disputes among its residents, making Sesame Street an "idealized place of child empowerment".

According to Davis, Sesame Street's curriculum began addressing affective goals more overtly during the 1980s, when the show focused on "turning inward, expanding its young viewers' world". Davis reported that their affective goals were inspired by the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. For example, in one of the show's landmarks, the producers addressed grief after the 1982 death of Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere. In 1985, Sesame Street addressed adoption with Gordon and Susan's adoption of Miles. They emphasized adoption's effect on parenting, family relationships, including sibling rivalry focusing on how Miles' addition affected Big Bird and other Muppet characters, and how he changed his working parents' lives. The Associated Press reported that the show's producers, after "extensive research", chose not to refer to Miles' biological parents because child development experts thought it might frighten young children.

For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the topics of love, marriage, and childbirth were addressed when the producers created a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child, Gabi. Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria, had married and became pregnant; according to the book Sesame Street Unpaved, published after the show's thirtieth anniversary in 1999, Manzano's real-life experiences gave the show's writers and producers the idea. Research was done before any scripts were written to gain an understanding of the previous studies about preschoolers' understanding of love, marriage, and family. The show's research staff found that at the time, there was very little relevant research done about children's understanding of these topics, and no books for children had been written about them. Studies done after the episodes about Maria's pregnancy aired showed that as a result of watching these episodes, children's understanding of pregnancy increased.

Another way Sesame Street addressed affective goals was by addressing real-life disasters. For example, the producers addressed the September 11 terrorist attacks with an episode that aired in early 2002. They also produced a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These episodes were used in Sesame Workshop's Community Outreach program.

Gikow called writer Emily Perl Kingsley an "expert" at interpreting the show's curriculum goals surrounding tolerance, diversity, and inclusion, especially as it related to the disability community. Kingsley has been a leader in the Workshop for ensuring that people with disabilities were included in the show. For example, she hired the Little Theater of the Deaf to appear on Sesame Street, and was instrumental in the addition of Deaf actress Linda Bove to its cast. Kingsley's son Jason, who had Down syndrome, also appeared several times on the show. As Kingsley reported, "...Sesame Street has a better record than any other show in the history of television of doing this on a regular basis in a comfortable kind of way".

Outreach
Sesame Street focused on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, they needed to encourage all children, no matter what their background, to watch it. At the same time, however, their primary goal was to make the show appealing to inner-city families, a group that did not traditionally watch educational programs on public television. As Lesser stated, "If the series did not work for poor children, the entire project would fail". Morrow called the new show's audience "concentric", with its targeted audience, "the urban poor", within the larger circle of all preschoolers.

The Workshop devoted 8% of their initial budget to advertise the new show. In what Morrow called "an extensive campaign" that Lesser stated "would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To get the word out to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.

After Sesame Street's popularity became established after its first season, the CES' outreach efforts turned from promotion to the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. The child-care community eventually became the CES' "core constituency". Early outreach efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. In the early 1980s, the CES developed into the Sesame Street Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the show as an educational resource.

The Workshop's outreach programs included providing materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Instead of following the traditional practice of translating their English materials into Spanish, for example, they employed what they called "versioning", or creating parallel sets of materials that conveyed the same content and messages in culturally and linguistically relevant ways. Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVD focusing on how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. The Workshop's outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.

In 2013, SW started Sesame Street in Communities, a branch of their outreach efforts. Sesame Street in Communities, working with caregivers and community organizations, provided resources to help families dealing with difficult issues. It provided hundreds of multi-media tools (videos, storybooks, games, activities, and other resources), in both English and Spanish. Its topics included teaching early literacy and math concepts, nutritious eating, divorce, exercise, exploring emotions, grief, divorce, and food insecurity. It got most of its funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and other organizations. In 2017, Sesame Street in Communities, starting in three pilot sites in Guilford County, North Carolina, Kansas City, Missouri, and Los Angeles, planned to expand to over 35 more communities, work with over 11,000 direct service providers, and reach 4.5 million children under the age of 6 and their families.
Chase Augustus Whiteside (born March 4, 1988) is a documentary filmmaker, journalist, and co-founder of New Left Media. Whiteside is perhaps best known for his films documenting the participants at Tea Party events. Those documentaries, which IndieWire called "a perfect example of where documentary form and style is headed," have received more than 7 million views on YouTube. Henry Rollins wrote of his interviews with conservatives in a Vanity Fair column, "The very talented Mr. Whiteside is a good interviewer and puts his subjects at ease." The Advocate calls him an "ambitious gay reporter."

Whiteside has been notably critical of cable news, telling The Washington Post's David Weigel, "CNN, like Fox News and MSNBC, should be largely dismissed as serious sources of news... as these outlets are all in the market of selling journalism through personalities, talking haircuts who report as much on what each other are saying as they do on reality."

The Hamburg Airport S-Bahn line is a nearly three-kilometre long railway line used by the Hamburg S-Bahn. It was opened on 11 December 2008.

Route 
The Airport S-Bahn line connects Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel Airport via Ohlsdorf station with central Hamburg. The line, with the exception of a short section to the north of Ohlsdorf, is entirely underground. The tunnel ramp is located directly in front of Klein Borstel station on U-Bahn line U1. The tunnel is built at a depth of up to 30 metres below the surface due to geological conditions. It passes under the Alster river and the large residential area of Fuhlsbüttel.

Operations 
The route is served by S-Bahn line S1. Trains coming from the city are partitioned at the Ohlsdorf station. The front part of the train runs to the airport and the back of the train continues on the original route of line S1 to Poppenbüttel. Similarly trains running into the city are coupled together at Ohlsdorf. The journey time from Hamburg Hauptbahnhof to the airport is 24 minutes and it is 25 minutes in the opposite direction. Trains between the city and the airport run at ten-minute intervals during the day and at 20-minute intervals in the early morning and the late evening. The track is operated and monitored from an electronic signal box in Ohlsdorf, which was opened in September 2008, just months before the opening of the airport line. The line is equipped with the modern Ks-signal system and GSM-R digital radio.

History 

A railway to the airport has been discussed since the 1960s, including as a possible extension of the original route of U-Bahn line 4, on which work was abandoned in 1974. Further planning of a rail connection progressed slowly, partly because until the 1980s, there were plans for a new major airport at Kaltenkirchen, replacing the existing Hamburg airport.  It was only after the plans for the new airport were dropped that a new rail link to the airport was re-examined, but little progress was made in the late 1980s due to lack of funding. However, in 1991 a shell for part of a station was built at the airport. In 1998 the Senate of Hamburg (government) decided to expand the airport, including a rail link. Progress was delayed by protests by local residents and work finally began on 11 April 2001. However, work was again delayed by water leaks during construction in 2004 and the line was finally opened to regular traffic on 12 December 2008. On the previous day free familiarisation trips operated to the airport station.

Extensions 
Under the air train (Flugzug) concept, the S-Bahn line would be extended north of the airport the line to connect with the line of the AKN Railway or the Alster Northern Railway. Connection to an upgraded AKN-trunk line via Henstedt-Ulzburg and Kaltenkirchen would create a Kiel–Hamburg Airport–Hamburg line, allowing connections between many parts of Schleswig-Holstein and the airport.

Line data 
The track is designed for a maximum speed of 80 km / h and electrified with the third-rail DC system used by the Hamburg S-Bahn. The tunnel ramp has a slope of 8.0 percent. Hamburg Airport (Flughafen) station has a 140 metre long central platform and is therefore suitable for the assembly of trains. The total cost of the project (as of 2008) was about €280 million, with 60% of funds coming from the city of Hamburg and 40% from the federal government. In the early days about 13,500 passengers a day were expected.

Discussion on the station name 
Until September 2008 it was envisaged that the new station would be named Hamburg Airport, that is, using English only. Following the current addition of the German term, Flughafen to the name, the Hamburg government responded to a joint request of its Christian Democratic Union and Green/Alternative List Hamburg members to change the name to Flughafen (Hamburg Airport). The proposal responded to complaints regarding the over-use of Anglicisms. Within days of the application the government distanced itself from the proposal, as modification would have led to significant costs for, for example, the reprinting of timetables and maps. Critics of the proposed change also suggested that an internationally oriented place like the airport station should use an English name. Nevertheless, the main signing of S-Bahn stations at Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport use German names as well as English.
Napoleon trail system is a natural area in Innisfail, Alberta, Canada. Motorized vehicles are not allowed on the trails, and night time exploring of the trails is not advised.

From 1896–1898 Poplar Grove graveyard moved to the present site, (Innisfail Memorial Cemetery), the excavation and relocation of sites took two years to complete.

Wes Browning murder

Several unmarked graves were never located, the approximate number is between 7–16 graves. Some of the relatives have expressed their wishes to not disturb the grounds further, and to leave those unmarked sites as is.  It is believed the archway pictured is the entrance to the burial grounds. Unexplained to this day is how and why the natural growth of the forest into the arch way. Also unexplained is how the branches on the arch reach towards the heavens and not towards the ground where the unmarked graves lay.

Legend has it the bludgeoned body of the orphaned 15-year-old, brutally murdered in the 19th century, lay in one of those unmarked graves. The boy is believed to be Wes Browning whose parents died when he was 5 years old. He then spent the rest of his days living in the basement of the St. Marks church. His murderer was never apprehended.

In 1945, another attempt to locate unmarked gravesites was funded by an anonymous donor.  Two gravesites were located and relocated to the new site. No other graves were found, and no other attempt has been made to locate and relocate those graves. Town council, in 1957 deemed Napoleon Trails as a protected and sacred area.

In the summer of 2006 an old building was discovered just off the trails with its roof in pieces from being smashed open by a tree. There was several blood stains on the floors and walls this was believed to be the site of Wes Browning's old home where his parents may have been murdered, the roof being smashed open was decided not be the cause of any "murders" in the home due to the age of the tree, the site was later demolished in 2009 to make way for a new highway into the town.
The Catholic Church in Morocco, Mauritania and Western Sahara (which is occupied and claimed by Morocco; all three share a Franco-Spanish colonial past) is composed only of a Latin hierarchy (no Eastern Catholic), without a single ecclesiastical province, as all are exempt, i.e. directly dependent on the Holy See, comprising:
 two non-metropolitan archbishoprics, both in Morocco;
 a bishopric for all Mauritania; and
 an apostolic prefecture for all Western Sahara.

Neither country has its own episcopal conference either, but 
 Morocco and Western Sahara are covered by the Regional Episcopal Conference of North Africa, with seat in Rabat (Morocco), which also includes states Algeria (Ecclesiastical Province of Alger), Libya and Tunisia (both entirely exempt), hence covering the Great Maghreb (western region of the Arab world) except Mauritania.
 Mauritania is covered by the Episcopal Conference of Senegal, Mauritania, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, with seat in Dakar (Senegal).

There is an Apostolic Nunciature (embassy level) to Morocco (in national capital Rabat) and an Apostolic Delegation (lower level) to Mauritania (actually vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to Senegal, in its capital Dakar) as papal diplomatic representations, none for Western Sahara.

Orchiectomy (also named orchidectomy, and sometimes shortened as orchi or orchie) is a surgical procedure in which one or both testicles are removed. The surgery is performed as treatment for testicular cancer, as part of surgery for transgender women, as management for advanced prostate cancer, and to remove damaged testes after testicular torsion. Less frequently, orchiectomy may be performed following a trauma, or due to wasting away of the testis or testes.

Procedure

Simple orchiectomy
A simple orchiectomy is commonly performed as part of gender reassignment surgery for transgender women, or as palliative treatment for advanced cases of prostate cancer. A simple orchiectomy may also be required in the event of testicular torsion.

For the procedure, the person lies flat on an operating table with the penis taped against the abdomen. The nurse shaves a small area for the incision. After anesthetic has been administered, the surgeon makes an incision in the midpoint of the scrotum and cuts through the underlying tissue. The surgeon removes the testicles and parts of the spermatic cord through the incision. The incision is closed with two layers of sutures and is covered with a surgical dressing. If desired, prosthetic testicles can be inserted before the incision is closed to present an outward appearance of a pre-surgical scrotum.

Subcapsular orchiectomy
A subcapsular orchiectomy is also commonly performed for treatment of prostate cancer. The operation is similar to that of a simple orchiectomy, with the exception that the glandular tissue that surrounds each testicle is removed rather than the entire testis itself. This type of orchiectomy is performed to remove testosterone-producing glandular tissue while maintaining the appearance of an ordinary scrotum.

Inguinal orchiectomy

Inguinal orchiectomy (named from the Latin  for "groin", and also called radical orchiectomy) is performed when an onset of testicular cancer is suspected, in order to prevent a possible spread of cancer from the spermatic cord into the lymph nodes near the kidneys.

An inguinal orchiectomy can be either unilateral (one testicle) or bilateral (both testicles). The surgeon makes an incision in the groin area (in contrast to an incision in the scrotum, as is done in both simple and subcapsular orchiectomies). The entire spermatic cord is removed, as well as the testicle(s). A long, non-absorbable suture may be left in the stump of the spermatic cord in case later surgery is deemed necessary. After the cord and testicle(s) have been removed, the surgeon washes the area with saline solution and closes the layers of tissues and skin with sutures. The wound is then covered with sterile gauze and bandaged.

Partial orchiectomy 
Partial orchiectomy is an option for individuals with testicular masses that want to preserve their testes and their function. During surgery, the testis is exposed in a similar way to inguinal orchiectomy. Once the testis is exposed and the spermatic cord is clamped, there is a current debate as to whether surgeons should deliver cold ischaemia which means submitting the organ, in this case the testis, into a cold/freezing environment. Whether or not it is submerged and frozen, the next step is to cut the tunica vaginalis and an ultrasound is used to find the tumor. After, the tumor is scraped away from the testis in a process called enucleation. Following enucleation, biopsies are taken of the tissues surrounding the testicle where the mass once was. Afterwards, each layer or tunica of the testis is sutured up and the testis is placed back in the scrotum. The skin layers are also closed up with sutures.

Pre-operative considerations
Guidelines state that fertility counseling should be offered to all patients undergoing inguinal orchiectomy, as there is a risk of reduced fertility or infertility. Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) accounts for 95% of cases of testicular cancer in young men. TGCT is associated with abnormal semen parameters. Because testicular cancer is commonly diagnosed in young, fertile men, it is critical that these individuals be educated on preserving their semen through freezing (cryopreservation) and complete a fertility assessment prior to surgery. In addition, testicular prosthesis placement counseling and education is encouraged to be given before an individual undergoes orchiectomy or before inguinal exploration with possibility of orchiectomy. This is an elective surgery which can be done at the time of orchiectomy. Testicular prosthesic placement has known psychological benefits (see below). Although risks for complications with prosthesis is low, individuals should also be informed of the possibility of infection, rotation, and replacement of prosthesis.

Post-operative care 
Following orchiectomy, those who have undergone the procedure are advised to avoid bathing, swimming, and heavy lifting for at least one month. If an individual had previously been taking hormone and/or hormone-blocking medications, modifications to their medication would be needed after the procedure. Any androgen-blocking medications, such as spironolactone or cyproterone, are stopped, and estrogen hormones can be resumed at the doctor's discretion. Post-operative pain management includes icing the surgical site, wearing supportive underwear, and the use of pain relief medications (analgesics) such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen; for more severe pain, narcotic analgesics may be needed. A follow-up appointment to monitor recovery and healing is routine.

Risks and complications
Risks and complications should be discussed with an individual pre-operatively. Risks and complications for inguinal orchiectomy include scrotal hematoma (accumulation of blood in the scrotum), infection, post-operative pain (60% initially, 1.8% one year after), phantom testis syndrome (pain in the kidney as a result from trauma from the testicle), reduced fertility, and with the more rare complications being inguinal hernia, ilioinguinal nerve injury, tumor spillage, and hypogonadism.

Effects 
Unilateral orchiectomy results in decreased sperm count but does not reduce testosterone levels. Bilateral orchiectomy causes infertility and greatly reduced testosterone levels. This can lead to side effects including loss of sexual interest, erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, breast enlargement (gynecomastia), weight gain, loss of muscle mass, and osteoporosis. It has been discovered that some individuals with a history of prostate cancer who had bilateral orchiectomy had effects on their new bone production, resulting in increased risk of bone fractures due to testosterone deficiency after the procedure.

Bilateral orchiectomy also reduces the use of exogenous medications for transgender women; the reduction in testosterone eliminates the need for testosterone-blocking medications and can contribute to feminizing features such as breast enlargement.

Psychosocial effects
The loss of one or both testicles from orchiectomy can have severe implications in a male's identity and self-image surrounding masculinity, such that it can lead to an individual having thoughts of hopelessness, inadequacy, and loss. Among testicular cancer survivors who have lost a testicle, there are feelings of shame and loss, which are more evident in young and single men than older and non-single men. As many as one third of individuals who will undergo orchiectomy are not offered the option of having a testicular prosthesis. Data shows that simply offering testicular prosthesis to individuals undergoing orchioectomy is psychologically beneficial. While some individuals do not mind losing a testicle, studies have shown that there is a change in body image in testicular cancer survivors who have undergone orchiectomy and an improvement in body image in 50-60% of individuals who undergo testicular prosthesis placement. One year after testicular prosthesis placement, there are reports of increase in self-esteem and psychological well-being during sexual activity in a study that followed up on post-orchiectomy individuals including adolescents. On the other hand, there is a current debate whether children undergoing orchiectomy should be offered testicular prosthesis to be inserted at the time of orchiectomy procedure.

Medical uses

Orchiectomy as a gender reassignment procedure 
Bilateral simple orchiectomy is one option for gender reassignment surgery for transgender women. It may be performed as a standalone procedure or at the same time as a vaginoplasty. Bilateral orchiectomy is considered first before undergoing vaginoplasty. Vaginoplasty can still be administered after undergoing bilateral orchiectomy, as the orchiectomy preserves the penoscrotal skin that can later be transformed into a skin flap. Additionally, it is an option for those who are unable to undergo vaginoplasty due to the risk of complications.

In addition to alleviating gender dysphoria, the procedure allows trans women to stop taking testosterone-blocking medications, which may cause unwanted side effects. Some common testosterone-blocking medications that most use before undergoing orchiectomy are spironolactone and cyproterone. Common side effects caused by spironolactone are drowsiness, confusion, headache, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, gastritis, polyuria, polydipsia, and electrolyte imbalance (hyperkalemia). Cyproterone can cause side effects such as fatigue, low mood, and fulminant hepatitis. Orchiectomy allows individuals to stop taking these medications and avoid these adverse effects. It is also an alternative for trans women who have contraindications to antiandrogens and is a minimally invasive procedure to eliminate testosterone levels.

Pre-operative evaluation

World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) criteria 
Criteria from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) are used as a framework to guide health care professionals in approving or denying an orchiectomy. When a transgender individual wants to complete an orchiectomy, they are in a state of gender incongruence and they must meet the criteria before having the procedure done. The criteria are as follows:(i) persistent, documented gender dysphoria,

(ii) capacity to make informed decisions and consent to treatment,

(iii) well-controlled medical or mental health comorbidities, and

(iv) the use of hormone therapy for 12 months.Additionally, persons wishing to go through with the procedure are required to obtain referrals from two independent qualified mental health professionals. This referral should include "the individual's demographic information, psychosocial assessment results, duration of the therapeutic relationship, type of evaluation and therapy performed, if the criteria for surgery have been met and if informed consent has been obtained from the patient."

Other medical considerations 
An individual seeking to undergo orchiectomy is evaluated by a healthcare provider to ensure that the procedure is safe. Many candidates for orchiectomy are on estrogen therapy before the operation, which increases risk of intraoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE); thus, the provider must take this risk into account and determine whether prophylaxis (prevention) is necessary. Current smokers, individuals with limited mobility, individuals older than the age of 40, and individuals who have a medical history of thrombolytic disorder are at higher risk of developing VTE. For these high-risk populations, the use of sequential compression devices during the operation is recommended to prevent VTE complications.

Orchiectomy as diagnosis and treatment for testicular cancer 
Testicular cancer most commonly occurs in males ages 15 to 34. In 2017, there were 8,850 new cases and 410 deaths in the United States.

The American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) 2019 guidelines recommend imaging with testicular ultrasound in any individual suspected of having testicular cancer following a physical examination. The ultrasound aids in differentiating diagnoses so that the individual may avoid the need of the surgical approach of inguinal orchiectomy. Inguinal orchiectomy is the gold standard treatment approach for those with confirmed malignancy of testicular cancer. Thus, it is imperative to diagnose the individual as having benign tumor vs. malignant tumor. Benign tumors are cancerous masses typically outside the testicle or surrounding it (extratesticular), whereas the malignant tumors typically lie within/inside the testicle (intratesticular).

An orchiectomy is used not only as a treatment option, but also as a diagnostic tool for testicular cancer. Before an orchiectomy is deemed necessary, liver function tests, tumor markers, and various blood panels are taken to confirm the presence of testicular cancer. Tumor markers that may be checked include beta human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate dehydrogenase, and alpha fetoprotein. These markers are rechecked after orchiectomy to stage the testicular cancer. Imaging, including chest radiography and an abdominal/pelvic CT (computed tomography) are also performed after orchiectomy to evaluate for metastasis. An inguinal orchiectomy is the primary treatment for any cancerous tumor that is found in the testicles; however, in cases where tumors are small, testis- or testes-sparing surgery may be performed instead.

Partial orchiectomy, also known as testis-sparing surgery, is another treatment option for smaller testicular masses which is becoming widely popular in recent years. This treatment option is an alternative to remove testicular cancer masses which are <20 mm, have a high probability of being benign, and with negative serum tumor markers. Its benefits include preserving fertility and normal hormone function.

About half of testicular cancer germ cell tumors are seminomas. Individuals with seminomas are 80-85% likely to have a stage 1 diagnosis and the individual must undergo surveillance every 3–6 months in the first year following their orchiectomy, with an abdominal/pelvic CT at 3, 6 and 12 months. Additional treatment such as chemotherapy may be given if they have risk factors for a relapse. Men with stage 1 seminoma after orchiectomy have been shown to be free from a relapse for five years following orchiectomy.

Orchiectomy as a complication of testicular torsion
Among children and adolescents diagnosed with testicular torsion, the orchiectomy rate is as high as 42%. Though the goal during surgery is to correct the twist of the spermatic cord, orchiectomy is performed if the testicle is examined during the surgery to have dead tissue (necrosis) and suspected to no longer be a functioning testicle (no fertility). Delays in diagnosis and treatment increase the risk of orchiectomy, with diagnosis in the first four to eight hours of symptoms being critical to prevent permanent ischemic damage, decreased fertility, and need for orchiectomy.

Orchiectomy for prostate cancer 
Prostate cancer, if non-metastatic, is commonly treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Less often, orchiectomy is used to treat prostate cancer. Prostate cancer grows in the presence of testosterone. When testosterone is present, " it is metabolized and converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which stimulates the growth of prostate cells. This leads to normal prostate growth in adolescents but contributes to abnormal cell growth in older men." Reducing the amount of testosterone in a person is one way in which prostate cancer is treated. If the prostate cancer is in fact metastatic, then orchiectomy may be used "...to abolish the stimulation of cancer cells by inhibiting testicular testosterone production and thereby reducing androgen levels in the blood: so-called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)." Castration or orchiectomy is a suitable option for androgen deprivation therapy, and it should be used if a very quick reduction in testosterone levels is needed. However, in recent years, orchiectomy is not commonly used since medical castration is a viable option. Medical castration means that drugs or medications are used to suppress the production of androgens such as testosterone. Some examples of medications used in medical castration include, euprolide, goserelin (Zoladex), buserelin, and triptorelin (Trelstar). Some of the side effects of these medications include but are not limited to "Reduced sexual desire and libido, Impotence, reduced size of testes and penis, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue (gynaecomastia) and pain across the breasts, thinning of the bones or osteoporosis and risk of fracture, anemia, loss of muscle mass, weight gain, fatigue and memory problems, and depression."

Orchiectomy for pediatric testis tumors 
Until the mid-1980s, pediatric testis tumors were managed in accordance with adult guidelines where the standard therapy was radical inguinal orchiectomy. It was later discovered that this procedure was being overused in the pediatric population, particularly those in pre-puberty, because it was assumed that the tumor was malignant. It was discovered that the majority of the pediatric tumor registries over reported malignant tumors and had biased reporting. It has now been found that most tumors are benign lesions and the majority are cases of teratoma which act benign in pre-puberty pediatric individuals along with other benign tumors that have been reported such as: Sertolic cell tumor, Leydig cell tumor and juvenile granulosa cell tumors. Most malignant tumors found in pre-pubertal individuals are pure yolk sac tumors. There is a difference in pre-pubertal, post-pubertal, and adult testis tumors in their histology and their level of malignancy with malignant tumors being rare in the pre-pubertal pediatric population. There has been a consideration to switch to testes sparing surgery (TSS) such as partial orchiectomy specifically for the pre-puberty pediatric populations who lack signs of malignant tumors. Partial orchiectomy allows the ability to preserve hormone function and the possibility of reproduction in the future. It has also been found to increase the quality of life. In the case that an individual is pediatric (<18 years of age) and is a post-pubertal with a malignant testes tumor, they must follow the adult recommended standard guidelines and proceed with radical inguinal orchiectomy.

Post-pubertal populations 
The post-pubertal pediatric population and adults are at higher risk of malignant tumors and usually have a histology of a mixed germ cell tumor. Their first line of treatment is radical orchiectomy; however, they may be candidates for testis-sparing surgery such as partial orchiectomy, if there is a presence of a benign tumor. Although partial orchiectomy is controversial for this group of individuals, it has been found to be a successful procedure for benign masses such as stromal tumors, epidermoid cysts, and fibrous pseudotumors. There is greater use of partial orchiectomy with individuals who have small, benign testicular mass usually < 2 cm which indicate the tumors being benign. There is limited data on the size of tumors of the pediatric population, therefore, size cannot be used as a predictor of a tumor being benign.

Holy Buckeye is the nickname given to one of the most famous plays in the history of Ohio State football.  It occurred in a late-regular season game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Purdue Boilermakers at Ross–Ade Stadium in West Lafayette, Indiana, on November 9, 2002.

The play was a critical point for the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team, as an incomplete pass (or a failed first-down conversion) would have likely resulted in a loss to Purdue, which in turn, would have almost certainly removed Ohio State from national championship contention.  The nickname "Holy Buckeye" is a play on other similar expressions (e.g., "holy cow", "holy mackerel", etc.) and came from Brent Musburger, the ABC television play-by-play announcer, who exclaimed the phrase as the completion was made.

Events of the play

Ohio State, which had been struggling on offense for the entire game, found itself with a 3rd and 14 at the 50-yard line, trailing Purdue by a score of 6–3 with 2:26 remaining in the game.  After completing a 13-yard pass to Ben Hartsock on the left sideline, Ohio State had a 4th and 1 to go.  Rather than have the kicker Mike Nugent attempt a long field goal to tie, or call a running play for tailback Lydell Ross to gain the necessary yardage to avoid a turnover on downs (star running back Maurice Clarett was injured and could not play), Jim Tressel called the "King Right 64 Y Shallow Swap" - a pass.  With the game clock still running from the previous play, the ball was snapped with just 1:44 left, and after dropping back, quarterback Craig Krenzel stepped up into the pocket and threw a 37-yard pass down the left sideline, which was caught by Michael Jenkins in the endzone to score the winning touchdown.

The Buckeyes moved to 11–0 with the victory and kept their national championship hopes alive. After two straight close wins against Illinois and Michigan, Ohio State won the Fiesta Bowl against the Miami Hurricanes to win the national championship and complete a 14–0 season. Purdue fell to 4–6 with the loss, but rebounded to win their final games of the regular season and received an invitation to the Sun Bowl, which they won 34–24 over Washington to finish the season 7–6.

World Interfaith Harmony Week is a UN resolution for a worldwide week of interfaith harmony proposed in 2010 by King Abdullah II and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan. The World Interfaith Harmony Week falls in the first week of February of every year and aims to promote harmony between all people regardless of their faith.

Introduction 

On September 23, 2010, King Abdullah II of Jordan proposed a World Interfaith Harmony Week at the Plenary Session of the 65th United Nations General Assembly in New York City. In the speech King Abdullah said:

It is [also] essential to resist forces of division that spread misunderstanding and mistrust especially among peoples of different religions. The fact is, humanity everywhere is bound together, not only by mutual interests, but by shared commandments to love God and neighbour; to love the good and neighbour. This week, my delegation, with the support of our friends on every continent, will introduce a draft resolution for an annual World Interfaith Harmony Week. What we are proposing is a special week, during which the world's people, in their own places of worship, could express the teachings of their own faith about tolerance, respect for the other and peace. I hope this resolution will have your support.

On October 20, 2010, Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan, Special Advisor and Personal Envoy to the King Abdullah II and author of the resolution, presented the proposal for a World Interfaith Harmony Week before the UN General Assembly in New York where it was adopted unanimously.

The basis for the World Interfaith Harmony Week is the A Common Word Initiative which was authored by Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad and released in 2007. The A Common Word Initiative and the World Interfaith Harmony Week stem from the idea that humanity is bound together by the two shared commandments of 'Love of God and Love of the Neighbor' or 'Love of the Good and Love of the Neighbor'.

In his speech at the UN General Assembly, Prince Ghazi of Jordan stated that the aim of the Interfaith Harmony Week would be fulfilled by:

permanently and regularly encouraging the silent majority of preachers to declare themselves for peace and harmony and providing a ready-made vehicle for them to do so … if preachers and teachers commit themselves on the record once a year to peace and harmony, this means that when the next interreligious crisis or provocation occurs, they cannot then relapse into parochial fear and mistrust, and  will be more likely to resist the winds of popular demagoguery

The draft resolution A/65/L5 titled the World Interfaith Harmony Week put forth by Jordan was sponsored by 29 co-sponsors - Albania, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Liberia, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Yemen.

The Udet U 11 Kondor was a German four-engined airliner designed and built by Udet Flugzeugbau, only one was built.

Design and development
The U 11 Kondor was an open-cockpit, metal-fuselage, wooden high-wing monoplane powered by four  Siemens-Halske Sh 12 piston engines in shaft-driven pusher configuration. It had a crew of three and room for eight passengers with a dangerously close clearance between the pusher propellers and rear passenger door, which caused one fatality. The aircraft was tested by Harry Rother near Munich, finding a tail-heavy condition which required addition of larger control surfaces. The only U 11 was first flown on 19 January 1926 and was refused by Deutsche Luft-Reederei then purchased by Deutsche Luft Hansa, crashing on its delivery flight. The cost to develop and produce the prototype was a factor in the collapse of the company, which was then taken over by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke.

Raj Bhushan / Raj Bhooshan / Rajyabhushan (literally Ornament of the Raj), was a second highest title of honor or civilian award, which was prevalent in Princely India during British Raj.

History
Raj Bhushan awards were given by rulers of mostly Hindu Princely States of India to distinguished citizens of their kingdom. The title was bestowed  upon with a Silver coin medallion. The next higher award was Raj Ratna, which was the highest award of Princely India.

The title and awards of Raj Ratna & Raj Bhushan came to an end mostly by the end of year 1949 with the amalgamation of almost all Princely States into India and formation of the Republic of India

However, the legacy, spirit and essence of these awards are being carried forward in independent India, by similar other prestigious awards like Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri awarded by Government of India.

Notable people awarded title Raj Bhushan
Pranlal Devkaran Nanjee - awarded by Porbandar State
Dinshaw Ratanji Daboo, member of Baroda Legislative Council - awarded by Baroda State, 1927. Daboo was further awarded the Raj Ratna in 1936.
The Grammy Award for Best Música Mexicana Album (including Tejano) is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for releasing albums in the regional Mexican or Tejano genres. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".

In 2012, the award - then known as "Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album" - was one of the new categories that resulted from the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards for that year. According to the Academy, "it was determined that musical distinctions among some of the regional Mexican subgenres were often very difficult to draw, so the restructuring in categories was warranted". This award combined the previous categories for Best Regional Mexican Album and Best Tejano Album. Other Latin categories were also either merged or discontinued.

Further restructuring took place in 2012 and was implemented in the 2013 Grammy Award season. As of 2013, this category was merged with the Best Banda or Norteño Album category which had been created in 2012. According to the Academy, "Best Banda or Norteño Album and Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album are now merged into one category: "Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)", for albums containing at least 51 percent playing time of new vocal or instrumental regional Mexican (banda, norteño, corridos, gruperos, mariachi, ranchera, and Tejano) recordings." The category received its current name at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards following consultation with the Mexican music community and aims to recognize and acknowledge Mexican-influenced music produced in other countries.

As of the 2022, Mexican singer Vicente Fernandez holds the record for the most wins in this category, with three, including the one received posthumously at the 64th Grammy Award ceremony. Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea holds the record for the most nominations, with six (one of which went on to be awarded with a Grammy). Mexican band Banda el Recodo is the most nominated act without a win, with three unsuccessful nominations.

Marmilla is a natural region of southern-central Sardinia, Italy.
Etymology The name "Marmilla" comes from the vast rounded hills, probably resembling udders (see Marmilla castle in Las Plassas). Another hypothesis is that according to which given the presence of many marshes in the area, the landscape could appear dotted with "a thousand seas".
Tourism in the Marmilla can rely on various factors ranging from environmental assets, to the numerous Nuragic centers in the area, to architectural works. In particular, we note:

Environmental assets:
Giara of Gesturi
Monte Arci Natural Park
Nuragic centers:
Nuragic village of Su Nuraxi in Barumini,
Nuraghe Cuccurada in Mogoro,
Archaeological Area Nuraghe Sa Fogaia in Siddi
Tomb of the Giants "Sa Domu e s'Orcu" in Siddi
Genna Maria complex in Villanovaforru,
Su Mulinu Fortress in Villanovafranca,
Nuragic sanctuary of Santa Vittoria in Serri.

Architectural works

Romanesque churches of San Michele Arcangelo in Siddi, San Pietro in Villamar and San Giovanni Battista in Barumini
Gothic parish churches of San Vito di Gergei, Santa Barbara in Genoni and Beata Vergine Immacolata in Barumini,
Judicial castle of Las Plassas,
Sixteenth century house Zapata di Barumini
Portals of the historic houses of Simala
Church with Romanesque features San Biagio (Santu Brai) di Furtei
Museums:

"Sa Corona Arrubuia" Museum in Lunamatrona
Ornithological Museum in Siddi
Obsidian Museum in Pau
Monte Arci Geomuseum in Masullas
Museum "The Knights of the Hills" in Masullas
"Turcus and Morus" Museum in Gonnostramatza
MudA Museum in Las Plassas
Common

It is delimited from east and south by the Campidano, from north-west by Monte Arci, from north by the Giara di Gesturi and the Giara di Serri, and from east by the Flumini Mannu.

Geologically, most of Marmilla dates to the Miocene period, and is thus substantially younger than the rest of Sardinia. The landscape is mostly hilly, and human economical activities in the area include agriculture (prevalently cereals and  fava beans) and tourism.

Marmilla was inhabited since prehistoric times, as testified by the presence of nuraghe. To the Carthaginian domination date the fortress of Genoni. During the Middle Ages it was part of the Giudicato of Arborea and of the Giudicato of Cagliari.

Geography of SardiniaRafael Klein also known as Randy Klein (born 1949 New York City) is a British American artist, living and working in London.
Klein studied at the Art Students League of New York. His work includes painting, sculpture, and artists’ books. His first major exhibition was 'Tin Temples' at 112 Greene St. in New York. He moved to London in 1984, and had his studio at the Diorama alongside Justin Mortimer and Tai-Shan Schierenberg . From 1991 - 2000 he was lecturer in Metal Sculpture at City and Islington College. He has work in private and public collections in Europe and the USA, including the Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art. He has created public sculptures including at Nunhead Station, London and the Biblioteca Classense in Ravenna], Italy.

Criticism
'Klein seems to think in sculptural terms
as easily and directly as the bird sings. His show of sculpture and graphics at the Accademia Italiana and European Academy is almost like a ride in Disneyland, the invention is so ebullient.’
John Russell Taylor

The Times, London

'Klein tells stories pirouetting on the fine edge
between detachment and sympathy.’ 
Cathy Courtney, Art Monthly

'Klein's book is an epic tale of
creation and destruction. The structure allows us to
follow a narrative and to uncover layers of meaning in a way that could
not be done with any other form of art.’ 
Meg Duff, Tate Gallery Librarian
Books by Artists

'Rafael Klein is probably best known as an artist who works across several different formats – books, painting, increasingly film, and perhaps especially sculpture. One of Rafael’s strengths is the gentleness, the tenderness of his figurative work. I feel Rafael’s work offers solace and promise – the artist is holding us by the hand, taking us through and showing how we can rise above it all.'

Topeka Bridge & Iron Co. was a bridge company.  Its works include many bridges that are now listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.  Its Canyon Diablo Bridge was a concrete Luten arch bridge built in 1914.  Its Amelia Park Bridge, for another example, was built in 1914.

A state of Arizona study asserts that "All of the concrete Luten arches identified in Arizona are associated directly-either through engineering or construction-with the [firm], the western representative of Indianapolis-based engineer Daniel B. Luten."  For the Inspiration Bridge in Miami, Arizona, the town engineer built the bridge in 1921, and then four others exactly like it, from plans and specifications ordered from the Topeka Bridge & Iron Co.  The Topeka Bridge & Iron firm "also sent moulds with which to cast the decorative concrete balusters for the guardrails."

The 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Utah were held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012 and elected the four U.S. representatives from the state of Utah, an increase of one seat in reapportionment following the 2010 United States census. The elections coincided with the elections of other federal and state offices, including a quadrennial presidential election and an election to the U.S. Senate. Primary elections were held on June 26, 2012.

Overview

Redistricting
In Utah, the redistricting process was controlled by members of the Republican Party, who formed a majority on the State Legislature's redistricting committee. The plan passed October 2011 divides Salt Lake County among three districts, which Republicans argued would require Utah's U.S. Representatives focus on both urban and rural issues. Jim Dabakis, the chair of the Utah Democratic Party, argued that the map constituted a gerrymander designed to benefit the Republican Party.

District 1
Republican incumbent Rob Bishop, who has represented Utah's 1st congressional district since 2003, ran for re-election, having decided against running for governor.

Campaign
Despite beginning her campaign at a significant name recognition disadvantage to Matheson, Love was able to mount a strong challenge. This was in part fueled by a prime time speaking slot at the Republican National Convention where she impressed many with her backstory of a being the daughter of Haitian immigrants whose parents "Immigrated to the U.S. with $10 in their pocket" and her themes of self-reliance, small government and fiscal responsibility. However she was later hit by claims that she was technically an Anchor Baby, despite having seemingly backing the deportation of the US-born children of illegal immigrants.

Facing a district largely new to him, Matheson ran ads showcasing his independent credentials and airing clips of Love voicing support for cutting the Department of Education and privatizing Social Security. Despite the NRCC running ads trying to tie him to Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, Matheson's favorability rating remained at around 60% throughout the campaign.

Typical system tasks performed include scheduling maintenance plans (such as backups), handling Reporting Services subscriptions and performing log shipping sub-tasks (backup, copy, restore & check).  User tasks, such as scheduling some T-SQL or command line statement are also common.

SQLAgent has support for operators and alerts, so that administrators can be notified, e.g. by email.

Total: From Joy Division to New Order is a compilation album of material from Joy Division and New Order. It was released in the United Kingdom on 6 June 2011 by Rhino Entertainment and is the first album to feature songs from both bands in one album. It features five Joy Division tracks, including "Love Will Tear Us Apart", and thirteen New Order tracks, including a previously unreleased track, "Hellbent". A digital deluxe version also includes music videos.

In October 2019, the album was certified Gold by British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

Background
The record label were unhappy with calling the record a "Best Of", so after brainstorming with New Order, the title Total was eventually chosen by Bernard Sumner.

The album cover was created by Howard Wakefield who previously served as understudy to Peter Saville. Saville was involved in art direction and told The Guardian: "I realised this was a record that would be sold in supermarkets and advertised on television. So the cover has a 'pile it high, sell it cheap' aesthetic. As you open it out, it says Total, but folded up you just see the 'O's. It says, 'From Joy Division to New Order'. I couldn't bear the words 'Best of'. It's a long way from the independent record shop to Tesco, almost 33 years. At Factory, I had a freedom that was unprecedented in communications design. We lived out an ideal, without business calling the shots. It was a phenomenon."

The A&R for the release was handled by the band, Andrew Robinson (co-manager) and Gary Lancaster of Warner Music. In a bid to offer fans something new compared to previous compilations the album included four never-before on CD versions of the bands' tracks, including the original 7″ version of "True Faith" and Shep Pettibone's 7″ remix of "Bizarre Love Triangle". It also includes the shorter 4:24 edit of "The Perfect Kiss". All tracks were mastered from original source tapes by Frank Arkwright.

Reception

John Meagher, who wrote for the "Day & Night" section of The Irish Independent, wrote that "there's nothing here to attract existing fans of either bands. Instead, all Total does is to reinforce the idea that Joy Division/New Order was a hugely exciting source of music between 1978 and 1990 and New Order has been a pitiful shadow of their once-visionary selves ever since."

Asma al-Ghul (also Al Ghoul,  Alghoul) is a secular Palestinian feminist journalist who writes for the Ramallah-based newspaper Al-Ayyam, chronicling what she calls “the corruption of Fatah and the terrorism of Hamas.” Al-Ayyam is sometimes banned in Gaza by Hamas. Al-Ghul is described by The New York Times as "known for her defiant stance against violations of civil rights in Gaza."

Al-Ghul was born in 1982 in Rafah, a Gazan city bordering Egypt whose population is mainly Palestinian refugees. In 2003, she married an Egyptian poet and moved to Abu Dhabi. She and her husband later divorced, and she returned to Gaza with their son. In 2006, al-Ghul permanently took off her Islamic khimār (headscarf).

In 2009, al-Ghul reported being stopped and interrogated by Hamas after walking on a public beach near the Shati refugee camp in Gaza with a mixed-gender group of friends, while wearing jeans and a T-shirt with no headscarf, and laughing. The Associated Press said it was the first time since coming to power in 2007 that Hamas had tried to punish a woman for behaving in a way it viewed as un-Islamic. Al-Ghul says her male friends were subsequently detained for several hours, beaten, and then forced to sign statements saying they would not again "violate public moral standards." Hamas has denied that the incident took place.

In February 2011, al-Ghul said she was beaten while covering a rally expressing solidarity between Palestinians and Egyptians.

In March 2011, al-Ghul and seven other female Palestinian journalists said they were beaten and tortured by Hamas security forces while trying to cover rallies calling for Hamas to seek a peaceful reconciliation with Fatah. The Hamas government later apologized for some of the attacks and promised to launch an investigation.

At the age of 18, al-Ghul won the Palestinian Youth Literature award. In 2010, she received a Hellman/Hammett award from Human Rights Watch, aimed at helping writers "who dare to express ideas that criticize official public policy or people in power." Her work has been translated into English, Danish and Korean.

In 2012, al-Ghul was awarded the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation. She works for Lebanon's Samir Kassir Foundation, which advocates for media freedom.

On August 3, 2014, at least nine members from her family were killed in an Israeli airstrike, in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip.  In an essay, al-Ghul documents her experiences after hearing about the death of her family, entitled Never Ask Me About Peace Again.

In 2016, she published in French a book co-writing with Sélim Nassib, 'L'insoumise de Gaza', translated in English in 2018 by Mike Mitchell, 'A Rebel in Gaza: Behind the Lines of the Arab Spring, One Woman’s Story'.

The Don and Gee Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting is a fellowship program founded in 1986 to aid screenwriters. It is administered by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

History

Gee Nicholl, widow of producer Don Nicholl, worked with Julian Blaustein in 1985 to develop the program with the Academy. The original 1986 winners were Allison Anders, Dennis Clontz, and Jeff Eugenides. 1989 fellow Radha Bharadwaj wrote the first screenplay made into a film, the 1991 drama Closet Land. Clontz won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 and Eugenides won one in 2003. 1992 fellow Susannah Grant was the first nominated for an Academy Award, for the screenplay for Erin Brockovich. The fellowship celebrated its 25th year in 2010.

Beginning in 2013, a reading of scenes from winning screenplays have been performed by professional actors in front of an audience. In 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the reading was conducted virtually. Actors that have participated in these readings over the years include: Kathy Baker, Elle Fanning, Ken Jeong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Freida Pinto, Alia Shawkat, Wes Studi, Blair Underwood, Vince Vaughn, and Anton Yelchin.

As of the 2013 contest, 17 winning scripts have later been produced.

Mexichromis pusilla is a species of sea slug or dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chromodorididae.

Distribution
This nudibranch is found in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean.

Description
Mexichromis pusilla has a pink-orange body, gills and rhinophores.  The mantle is edged with a broad pale yellow band, and there are two white spots on its dorsum. This species is easily confused with other similarly coloured nudibranchs, especially Verconia varians and Verconia norba.

This species can reach a total length of at least 20 mm, and like all  Chromodorids, feeds on sponges.
Joan of Savoy  (1310 – 29 June 1344), was Duchess consort of Brittany by marriage to John III, Duke of Brittany. Joan was the claimant to the County of Savoy upon the death of her father in 1329 until 1339.

Life
Joan was born in 1310, she was the only child of Edward, Count of Savoy, and his wife, Blanche of Burgundy. 

Joan married 1329, aged nineteen, to the forty-three-year-old childless John III, Duke of Brittany; she was his third wife, John's second wife Isabella had died the previous year. 

The same year as Joan's marriage, her father died.  Being his only child she considered herself his successor. However, Savoy had never had a female ruler, leading to a dispute in the succession. Joan's uncle Aymon had the support of the nobles of Savoy for the Semi-Salic inheritance and succeeded as count.

John supported Joan's rights on Savoy. After the marriage, Joan renewed her claim on Savoy and allied herself with the Dauphin de Viennois against her uncle. By agreement settled by the French King  on 22 November 1339, she renounced her rights of succession in return for an annual income of 6000 livres.

Joan and John were married for twelve years but produced no offspring, and John died on 30 April 1341, leaving Joan a childless widow.  This led to a disputed succession in Brittany between John's half-brother of the same name and John's niece Joan.

In 1343, when her uncle Aymon died, Joan renewed her claim on the county of Savoy against her nine-year-old cousin, Amadeus VI.  In her will, she left the county to Philip, Duke of Orléans to spite her cousins.  In the end, he negotiated a similar settlement to the one of Joan, yielding the claim in exchange for 5000 livres annually.

Joan died on 29 June 1344.
Hans-Otto Borgmann (20 October 1901 – 26 July 1977) was a German film music composer during the Third Reich.

He joined UFA as a silent film music conductor in 1928, and became head composer by 1931. A melody he had composed for a documentary on Svalbard island and had become well known was taken up by Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach who wrote new lyrics as "Our flag flutters before us", becoming one of the Hitler Youth's anthems.

In 1938 he composed a Großdeutsche Hymne for Schirach which coincided with the Anschluss of Austria.

From 1937 to 1951 he collaborated on a series of films with Veit Harlan. From 1959 to 1971 he withdrew from film popular music to lecture at the Max Reinhardt Theatre and privately compose difficult atonal music.

Isabelle Morin (born February 14, 1985) is a Canadian politician, who represented the Quebec riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine in the House of Commons of Canada under the banner of the New Democratic Party from May 2011 to November 2015. She defeated the local long-time liberal MP Marlene Jennings by more than 4,000 votes in the 2011 federal election.

Morin has a diploma in literature from Cégep François-Xavier Garneau in Quebec City and a bachelor of education from the Université de Sherbrooke. During her university studies, she was executive vice-president of the students’ federation (FEUS) and sat on the board of directors of the Fédération universitaire du Québec. In 2007 she co-founded Vélorution, an organization promoting the rights of bicyclists in Sherbrooke.

Before becoming a politician Morin taught French and drama at the secondary school Cavelier-De LaSalle. She also taught at the adult education 'Centre Louis-Jolliet' and 'Centre Saint-Michel' and the 'Centre de détention Sherbrooke' on rue Talbot.

Prior to being elected Member of Parliament, Morin took part in various humanitarian missions abroad and visited more than 25 countries including Guatemala where she learnt a lot about fair trade. While travelling she came to appreciate the importance of intercultural exchange and cooperation.

Parliamentary work

As the Official Opposition's deputy critic for Seniors, Morin fought to restore the retirement age from 67 to 65. She also served as the NDP critic for animal welfare and was president of the NDP Youth Caucus.

Moreover, since 2011 Morin has served as a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. Her work in this role focused, in particular, on road, bridge and aviation safety. Deeming this issue one of her key priorities, Morin urged the Conservative government of Stephen Harper via Bill C-305 to adopt a national strategy on transport in 2012. She has been involved in numerous initiatives including federal funding for the new Champlain Bridge as well as considerable investments in the infrastructure in her riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine.

Morin also pays close attention to environmental issues in her constituency be it air or water quality or noise pollution. Most notably, she has been a strong advocate for the preservation of Dorval Municipal Golf Course, whose green space is facing destruction due to the decision of the Airport of Montreal (ADM) to repurpose the land for new screening facilities. Morin has been supporting the Save Our Green Space campaign launched by local citizens. She tabled several petitions in the House of Commons, sent a letter to federal Transport Minister Lisa Raitt and participated in a demonstration on Parliament Hill to draw the government's attention to the problem.

Since acting in her role as MP for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine Morin has spoken out on various issues in the House of Commons:

- Dismantling of postal services and reduction of home delivery by Canada Post;

- Human trafficking;

- The conservative government's budget cuts for aerospace industry and employment insurance;

- Lack of coherent legal framework concerning animal rights.

2015 general election

Morin was defeated in the 2015 election by Liberal Anju Dhillon.

Cast
János Szabó (29 October 1937 – 25 February 2021) was a Hungarian jurist and politician, who served as Minister of Agriculture between 1993 and 1994.

Career
János Szabó was born in Tápiószentmárton in 1937, as the only child of farmer József Szabó and Margit Mester. His father was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union from January 1945 to July 1947. János attended elementary school in his birthplace. He finished his secondary studies at the Kossuth Lajos Gymnasium in Cegléd in 1956. He earned a degree in law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Szeged (SZTE) in 1960. He worked for the Military Prosecutor's Office of Debrecen and Szeged, then for the Council of Csongrád County between 1960 and 1965. He became a practicing lawyer in 1965, as a member of the Győr No. 1 Bar Association. He suspended his legal practice in 1990.

At the height of the transition to democracy, Szabó joined Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party (FKGP) in August 1989. He was elected prosecutor of the party's Győr-Moson-Sopron County branch in the autumn of that year. He ran for an individual seat for Győr (Győr-Moson-Sopron County Constituency I) during the 1990 parliamentary election, where he came to the third place after László Medgyasszay (MDF) and Dorottya Büky (SZDSZ). He obtained a mandate from his party's local county list. In the parliament, Szabó was a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Legislation and Justice from 1990 to 1991 and from 1992 to 1993 (serving as its vice-chairman in the latter period). Briefly, he was also a member of the Municipal, Administrative, Homeland Security and Police Committee from 1991 to 1992, and the Rules of Procedure Committee in 1992.

The coalition between the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) and the Independent Smallholders' Party, led by József Torgyán broke up in February 1992. Szabó joined that faction of the parliamentary group which intended to remain in the government. The majority of the caucus, the Group of 33 MPs, later 36 MPs continued to support the government, while FKGP (Group of 12 MPs then 10 MPs) went into opposition. Szabó was elected leader of the pro-government parliamentary group in September 1992, holding the position until February 1993. Prime Minister József Antall appointed him Minister of Agriculture on 23 February 1993. Meanwhile, the pro-government smallholders' faction formed the United Smallholders' Party (EKGP) as a formal organizational unit on 6 November 1993. Szabó was elected the first party chairman of the party on 19 December 1993. Szabó retained his ministerial position in the government of Péter Boross too until 15 July 1994. During the 1994 parliamentary election, the EKGP received only 0.82 percent of the vote, while its main rival the Torgyán-led FKGP again entered the parliament with 8.82 percent of the vote, thus Szabó lost his parliamentary seat. On 17 December 1994, Szabó was replaced by Géza Zsiros as party leader. He retired from national politics thereafter. He returned to the FKGP in 2002. Szabó was a member of the local representative body of Tápiószentmárton from 1998 to 2010.

Personal life
János Szabó married Gabriella Pethő in 1962. They had two children, lawyer László (b. 1964) and Katalin (b. 1971). Szabó was granted honorary citizenship of Tápiószentmárton in 1994, for "the development of his birthplace, for the aging of the good reputation of the village, for the help of the construction of the Tápiószentmárton-Albertirsa connecting road". He often played on his tárogató at local events.

Szabó died on 25 February 2021, at the age of 83.
The New Electric Railway Journal was a quarterly American magazine primarily about electric urban rail transit in North America, published from 1988 to 1998, with an international circulation. Its name was a tribute to a much earlier magazine with similar coverage, the Electric Railway Journal, established in 1884 and published until 1931.

Publication history
The first issue was that dated Autumn 1988.  The magazine was published by the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation (FCF) for most of its run, from 1988 until mid-1996.  Starting with the Summer 1996 issue, publication was transferred to CityRail, Ltd., a not-for-profit corporation based in Illinois.  The magazine abbreviated its own name as TNERJ (as opposed to "NERJ").

The magazine's publisher was Paul M. Weyrich, a noted American conservative and FCF's founder and president.  Weyrich was a longtime advocate of light rail transit and streetcars. As TNERJ publisher, he penned an opinion column for every issue, and he acknowledged that it was unusual for an American political conservative to support government investment in mass transit, but in the magazine he explained why he believed support for urban transit, and particularly rail transit, made sense and did not run counter to what he considered a "proper definition of conservatism." In the magazine's premiere issue, Weyrich wrote that he was "committed to rail transit" and that "rail transit – all but abandoned in the 1950s as yesteryear's mode of transportation – is back in a major way all across the nation." He also made it clear that, while the magazine's commentary sections would generally be advocating investment in rail transit, he and the editors would not hesitate to criticize existing or proposed rail-transit systems when they believed criticism was deserved.

Editor-in-chief of TNERJ for its entire run was Richard R. Kunz, who had previously worked as Rail Transit Editor of Passenger Train Journal.

Modes of transportation covered by The New Electric Railway Journal included light rail transit, streetcars, rapid transit (subway/metro) systems, commuter rail, trolley buses and, to a more limited extent, monorails and people-movers. The change to a different publishing company in 1996 did not change the magazine's focus, as the editor-in-chief and most other contributing editors remained the same.

Publication ceased in late 1998, when the issue carrying the date of "Winter 1998" was published, as a result primarily of the death of the editor, Richard Kunz.

Content overview
Each issue generally included about three or four feature articles, plus a  news section reporting on recent developments by city, on the aforementioned modes of transportation.  Regular geographic coverage extended to Canada and Mexico as well as the United States, but most issues also had a page or two of non-North American content, occasionally several pages.

Issues were 46–50 pages in length until 1994, thereafter 38–40 pages.  The magazine used high-quality paper, and over half of its pages were printed in color.  In some issues, 100% of the illustrations were in color.

Opinion columns
Along with publisher Weyrich and editor Kunz, others who contributed opinion columns – generally about one page in length each – on a regular basis included associate publisher William S. Lind and George Krambles, a former executive director of the Chicago Transit Authority (1976–1980).

Periodic features
Certain features were included only about once a year.  In the Spring issue, a one- to three-page feature called "Status Report" included a table listing all cities in North America served by electric transit, indicating which modes each had, and a calendar with projected dates of future significant developments, such as the opening of a new light rail system or line.  The annual Status Report and calendar were accompanied by a feature called "Rating the Rails", in which every electric urban transit operation (including the continent's then-eleven trolley bus systems) was given a performance rating on a scale of 1 to 5 by the editorial team, with 1 defined as "poor; multiple major problems" and 5 as "superior performance" in the original 1-to-5 scale, which was changed to a 1-to-10 scale in 1990. Accompanying comments explained the editors' rationale in cases of very low or very high ratings, or whenever a particular system's rating had changed from the previous edition of the list. One review of TNERJ in a British magazine said "the worth of" the annual Status Report and Rating the Rails features "seems a little questionable", but overall called the magazine "attractively produced", with "high standards" of editing.

Once per year, the editorial team selected a notable person working professionally in the North American transit industry, for the honor of "Man of the Year".  The award was given to someone deemed to have "made a significant positive contribution to the electric transit industry" in North America. Among the recipients was David Gunn, who had managed large transit systems in Philadelphia, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Toronto.  The 1995 recipient was female, so honoree Shirley DeLibero was appropriately referred to as TNERJs "Woman of the Year".

In a 1989 review of the magazine, Railfan & Railroad called TNERJ "one of the most worthwhile new products to enter the already saturated rail publication field", noting its "attractive color and black & white photos, maps and responsible writing".

Beyond the printed magazine
The American Public Transportation Association transcribed most of TNERJ 1992–1998 articles about heritage streetcar systems or topics onto its Heritage Trolley website, where they remain available in 2017.

Starting in January 1994, a monthly television show using the same name as the magazine began airing on the then-new National Empowerment Television satellite network, co-hosted by the magazine's associate publisher, Bill Lind, concerning the same topics as the magazine. The program aired on the last Sunday of each month.

As CityRail, Ltd., prepared to take over publication of the printed magazine, a supplementary digital newsletter called "CityRail" became available by email, offering greater detail of news coverage and more frequent reporting (monthly), as a separate subscription.

In early 2000, a little over one year after TNERJ ceased publication, its former publisher Paul Weyrich launched a website to provide a place for continued commentary and news reporting on electric rail transit, which he called "The New New Electric Railway Journal".  Weyrich and former TNERJ associate publisher William Lind were regular contributors to the website. The site remained active until 2009 (Weyrich died in December 2008).
Lynette Deborah White (5 July 1967 – 14 February 1988) was murdered on 14 February 1988 in Cardiff, Wales. South Wales Police issued a photofit image of a bloodstained, white male seen in the vicinity at the time of the murder but were unable to trace the man. In November 1988, the police charged five black and mixed-race men with White's murder, although none of the scientific evidence discovered at the crime scene could be linked to them. In November 1990, following what was then the longest murder trial in British history, three of the men were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.

In December 1992, the convictions were ruled unsafe and quashed by the Court of Appeal after it was decided that the police investigating the murder had acted improperly. The wrongful conviction of the three men has been called one of the most egregious miscarriages of justice in recent times. The police insisted that the men had been released purely on a legal technicality, that they would be seeking no other suspects, and resisted calls for the case to be reopened. In January 2002, new DNA technology enabled forensic scientists led by Angela Gallop to obtain a reliable crime scene DNA profile. The extracted profile led police to the real killer, Jeffrey Gafoor, who confessed to White's murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Gafoor received a shorter minimum tariff (the length of time before a prisoner may be considered for parole) than had been given to the wrongfully convicted men, due to the reduction for a guilty plea, highlighting a controversial feature of the sentencing guidelines.

In 2004, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a review of the conduct of the police during the original inquiry. Over the next 12 months around 30 people were arrested in connection with the investigation, 19 of whom were serving or retired police officers. In 2007, three of the prosecution witnesses who gave evidence at the original murder trial were convicted of perjury and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. In 2011, eight former police officers were charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Their subsequent trial was the largest police corruption trial in British criminal history. A further four police officers were due to be tried on the same charges in 2012. In November 2011, the trial collapsed when the defence claimed that copies of files which they said they should have seen had instead been destroyed. As a result, the judge ruled that the defendants could not receive a fair trial and they were acquitted. In January 2012, the missing documents were found, still in the original box in which they had been sent to South Wales Police by the IPCC.

Lynette White
White had left school without any qualifications and had been working as a prostitute since she was 14 years old. Tim Rogers, a BBC Wales journalist, interviewed White a few weeks before her murder as part of an investigation into child prostitution. Rogers said that White was "probably the most visible prostitute working in Cardiff at the time." Acquaintances said that "she would be the first girl out at lunchtime, and the last one left at night", even working on Christmas Day. Described by friends as "pretty and popular", White earned around £100 each night. She told Rogers that she had been drugged and taken to Bristol by a gang of men who forced her into prostitution and that even after eventually making her way back to Cardiff she had found herself trapped in "a continual spiral of prostitution." By 1988 she was working every day to pay for her boyfriend Stephen "Pineapple" Miller's cocaine addiction. Miller, who was also her pimp, took at least £60-£90 each day from White, who was his only source of income. Each day he would drive her to where she worked as a prostitute, Riverside, Cardiff, before meeting with her at the "North Star" club in the evenings to collect her earnings. The two lived together at a flat in Dorset Street, Cardiff.

White went missing five days before her murder and made no contact with Miller or any of her friends or known associates. Her whereabouts during this period or the reason for her disappearance have never been ascertained. She was due to be called as a witness for the prosecution in two forthcoming trials, and it was later conjectured that she was deliberately "lying low" to avoid giving evidence. The first trial (R. v Francine Cordle) involved an allegation of attempted murder and the second (R. v Robert Gent & Eric Marasco) involved an allegation of attempting to procure the services of a 13-year-old girl for prostitution. When White disappeared, the police began actively searching for her, and a judge issued a warrant for her arrest to ensure that she attended the first trial, which was listed to commence at Cardiff Crown Court on 15 February 1988.

Earlier in February 1988, another prostitute, Leanne Vilday, had loaned White the keys to the flat in James Street, where she was later murdered, for the purpose of taking clients there for sex. After White disappeared, Vilday was unable to get into the flat herself without the keys and on the evening of 14 February she asked taxi driver Eddie Dimond, who knew both women, to take her to the address. There Vilday was able to get another occupant to drop a spare set of keys from a window to open the main door of the building but was still unable to enter her own flat. Dimond and Vilday then drove to Butetown Police Station to report the situation and their concerns about White's disappearance. They returned to James Street with PS William Bisgood, PC Simon Johnson and PC Anthony Prosser, who were expecting to serve the arrest warrant on White and then take her into police custody. On arrival, Vilday and Dimond remained outside while the police forced entry and at 9.17 pm found White's body inside. PC Johnson later testified that he was aware that White was a "missing witness" in a court case and that officers had been looking for her. PC Prosser said, "We had been looking for her all weekend." He said he discovered White lying on her back on the floor of a bedroom in the flat, having suffered "massive injuries."

Murder
White's throat had been cut from the right ear across the front and around to the left side of the neck, exposing the bones of the spine. There were multiple stab wounds to her chest and breasts, and other wounds to her face, stomach, arms, wrists and inner thighs, as well as defensive wounds on her hands. Bernard Knight, the pathologist who conducted White's autopsy, described it as "a mutilating attack with sexual overtones" and identified a total of 69 wounds. Although she had been stabbed seven times in the heart he concluded that it was the throat injury which had killed her. He said: "It would require considerable force because the skin, muscles, larynx and voice box had been cut right down to the neckbone." Speculating on how the wound could have been inflicted, he said it was a normal reflex for a person to keep their head down in such a situation, and her head may have been forcibly held back for the knife wound to be inflicted. One of the two T-shirts Lynette was wearing was "absolutely lacerated. It looked like a colander." Knight believed the murder weapon was at least five inches long. He determined that she had died between midnight and 4am. Her wristwatch had stopped at 1:45am, leading the police to conclude that this was the most likely time of death.

White's body was discovered between the foot of the bed – the room's only furniture – and the window, still clothed but with one shoe off. There was heavy bloodstaining to the base of the bed, the carpet and the walls of the room. There was very little blood on the mattress, where an opened but unused condom was found. Forensic examination found 150 different sets of finger and palm prints in the flat. Azoospermic semen was present both in White's vagina and underwear, which pathologists determined had been deposited there within six hours of her death. Some of the blood found on White's clothing, including her exposed sock, was found to be from a male with the blood type AB.

Investigation
 
The subsequent murder inquiry was led by Detective Chief Superintendent (DCS) John Williams, the head of South Wales Police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Appeals for information led to several potential witnesses independently describing a white male, approximately 5'8"–5'10", aged in his mid-30s, with dark hair and a "dishevelled" appearance. He was seen in a distressed state in the vicinity of the James Street flat in the early hours of 14 February, appeared to have cut himself on the hand, and had blood on his clothing. An E-FIT of the suspect was compiled and on 17 March 1988 DCS Williams appeared on the BBC television programme Crimewatch UK, where he stated that the police believed this man was responsible for White's murder. Williams said: "This man almost certainly had the blood of the deceased on him."

On 25 February the police detained an individual who bore a striking resemblance to the e-fit but he was released the following day after providing an alibi corroborated by a third party. The suspect seen outside the flat has never been positively identified.

Elimination of suspects
Francine Cordle, whom White had been due to testify against, and Cordle's mother, Peggy Farrugia, were also initially considered suspects, but the discovery of the blood on White's clothing allowed the police to eliminate them from their inquiries.

Stephen Miller was questioned at the beginning of the inquiry, having been picked up by the police early on 15 February, but after giving a statement detailing his whereabouts during the crucial period, he was released without charge and the police announced that he had been ruled out of their investigations. When Miller was first taken in by the police for questioning he was still wearing the clothes that he had been wearing at the time of the murder. These were dirty and unwashed – the police even joked with Miller during his initial interview that he should sit in the opposite corner of the room due to the smell of his clothing – but there were no traces of blood found on them. His car was also forensically examined with no result, and his blood type did not match that found on White's clothing. Another witness, David Orton, also gave a statement to the police detailing his movements with Miller during the time of the murder, completely corroborating Miller's alibi.

Mr. X
On 20 April 1988 DC Geoff Thomas put together a list of 12 people of interest, based on their previous criminal activities. One of the men, whose identity has never been publicly revealed and was referred to only as 'Mr X', was a convicted sex offender and paedophile who lived around twenty minutes driving distance from James Street, was known to use prostitutes, and was a frequent visitor to Cardiff. He had a history of mental illness and had been classified as a "psychopath" by his doctor. When interviewed by the police, he admitted that he had in the past paid White for sex, and was unable to account for his movements or provide an alibi for the period of the murder. Crucially for the investigating officers, Mr. X was of blood type AB.

Mr. X was interviewed by Detective Constable Paul Fish, who believed that, had he been pressed, he would have confessed to White's murder. It was decided however to adopt a "softly-softly" approach until they had DNA results from the crimescene. On 19 October 1988 Detective Inspector Graham Mouncher placed Mr. X under surveillance for three days to identify his routines and associates. The policemen's main concern was that Mr. X would voluntarily commit himself to a mental institution if he became aware of the surveillance but by 25 October DI Mouncher was so convinced that he was the killer that he requested further surveillance. This took place between 27 and 30 October 1988. On 7 November 1988 Detective Chief Inspector Adrian Morgan informed DCS Williams that Mr. X was now the prime suspect.

On 9 November 1988 the results of the DNA analysis eliminated Mr. X from the investigation.

Constructing a case

Paul Atkins and Mark Grommek
Although their prime suspect had been eliminated from the inquiry, the police had collected thousands of statements through interviews and door-to-door enquiries. After the collapse of their case against Mr. X the police now returned to these. Among them were statements from Paul Atkins and Mark Grommek, two associates of Mr. X. Grommek was the tenant of the flat immediately above that where White was murdered. Both Atkins and Grommek were homosexual and had previous convictions for petty crimes, which made them, in the view of Satish Sekar, "susceptible to police pressure."

Both men gave alibis for their whereabouts at the time of the murder, but under pressure from the police Atkins eventually gave a statement on 26 April in which he first said that Grommek had killed White, and then confessed to killing her himself.

Detective Chief Inspector John Ludlow recorded that Atkins first stated that Grommek had gone to the flat to have sex with White and after hearing a scream, Atkins went downstairs and saw Grommek exiting the flat covered in blood and carrying a blood stained knife. Atkins later said he had met White himself in the Custom House pub and went back to the flat to have sex with her. He then "wrestled her to the floor, sat astride her and stabbed her." As the statement contained "four completely different accounts in the one document" it was not treated seriously.

Ronnie Williams
Yusef Abdullahi had been questioned as part of the routine door-to-door enquiries. At the time of the murder he had been working on board the ship MV Coral Sea, some  away in Barry Docks. Although he did not realise this at the time, his common-law wife Jackie Harris was having an affair with Geoff Smith, a South Wales police officer attached to the Vice Squad. His common-law brother-in-law, Ronnie Williams, was also a police informant. Williams began passing information to the police in March 1988, much of it unreliable, including a claim that White had been stabbed in the Casablanca club in Butetown before being moved to the flat in James Street. Initially he claimed that Abdullahi knew the identity of the killer and was concealing this information but later he began to implicate him more directly with the murder, and claimed that Abdullahi had been able to leave work at the Coral Sea on the night of the murder without his colleagues being aware. It was well known by their associates and the police that Abdullahi and Williams "detested each other." On 19 May 1988 Detective Inspector Richard Powell took a formal statement from Abdullahi in which he gave details of his work on the Coral Sea.

Leanne Vilday
Leanne Vilday had also been placed under pressure during her interviews, particularly as it was she who had initially raised the alarm with the police, who felt she may be concealing information. She was a single parent, a lesbian, a drug addict, and a prostitute. The police were visiting her daily, leading to her being asked to leave the flat she shared with her friend, Angela Psaila, who was also a prostitute. She began lodging with another couple, who also complained that the police were calling round to speak with Vilday on an almost daily basis. On 19 May 1988, while drunk, Vilday eventually named Miller and Yusef Abdullahi as the killers in front of several other prostitutes. That evening she was questioned by PS David Hathaway and agreed that she had named the two men while drunk, but said this was a false accusation as a result of "drunken rambling" and that she had heard the names from DI Powell when he had questioned her earlier in the day. She was then asked by the police if she would agree to be hypnotised, and a session with a hypnotherapist was scheduled.

Violet Perriam
Violet Elizabeth Perriam was a secretary at a Cardiff yacht club. On 10 November 1988, the day after Mr. X was cleared of any involvement, Perriam gave a statement to the police that she had been driving home from the club and had passed 7 James Street at around 1.30 am on the night that White was murdered. She claimed that she saw four "excited" black males outside the building, "arguing and gesticulating," and recognised two of them as John Actie and Rashid Omar, who was of mixed-race. John Actie had earlier responded to the door-to-door enquiries and told the police that on the night of the murder he had gone to the Casablanca club at around midnight, and had left there at around 3.30 am. John Actie was the cousin of Leanne Vilday's boyfriend, Ronnie Actie. Perriam's statement was the "breakthrough" needed by the police and her allegation that she saw John Actie and others "at or near the scene of the murder" allowed the investigation to take a new direction after it had reached an impasse following the elimination of Mr. X.

Angela Psaila
Angela Psaila lived in a flat at St Clare's Court, Butetown, which had an unrestricted view of the front of 7 James Street. Described later as "one of the most vulnerable members of Cardiff society", Psaila had an IQ of just 55, indicating mild mental retardation. Armed with Perriam's statement placing the group of black men outside the flat at the time of the murder, the police questioned Psaila on 17 November 1988 and insisted that she was somehow connected with the crime. In the first of two statements taken that day, Psaila claimed that Miller visited her at about 1am on 14 February looking for White. Two and a half hours later she gave another statement claiming that she saw Miller, John and Ronnie Actie, Abdullahi, Tony Paris and Tony Brace (a doorman from the North Star club) outside 7 James Street. She also claimed to have heard screams from the flat and to have seen Ronnie Actie talking up to someone in the window of Grommek's flat before being let into the building. As part of the 2021 three-part BBC documentary A Killing in Tiger Bay the supposed screaming was reconstructed, using an actress in White's former flat and sensitive sound recording equipment placed at Psaila's former flat. Even with no background noise, the screams were barely audible.

The same day, Grommek and Atkins gave new statements to the police saying that they had also seen a group of men outside the flat, including Ronnie Actie and Abdullahi. During his first interview, in the morning, Grommek had stated that he knew nothing about the murder but by the afternoon he had given a very detailed account of the circumstances surrounding the crime. Grommek also said that he had opened the door to the building to let Ronnie Actie in, and both he and Atkins now claimed that they too had heard screams that night.

Psaila and Vilday: December statements
Psaila gave a new statement to the police on 6 December 1988. In this account, she had been present at St Clare's Court with Leanne Vilday and on hearing the screams the two had gone to 7 James Street. In what Sekar called "a most remarkable coincidence", Vilday, Grommek and Atkins all decided independently to go to the police that day and give new accounts of the murder. Vilday said that on hearing the screams she had gone to the flat and found White dead inside. In the room were Miller, Abdullahi, Ronnie Actie, Tony Miller (Stephen Miller's brother) and an unnamed man of mixed-race. Grommek and Atkins gave statements which corroborated this new version of events. Psaila and Vilday were then taken into protective custody.

On 7 December 1988, the police arrested Stephen and Tony Miller, Yusef Abdullahi, Ronnie Actie, Rashid Omar and Martin Tucker. John Actie and Tony Paris were arrested on 9 December. No forensic evidence had been found to link any of the men with the crime scene.

The police were notified on 10 December that Psaila's blood type was AB, the same as that found on White's sock and trousers. They reinterviewed her the following day, insisting that it was her blood that was found on White. Psaila gave a new version of events, this time claiming that she and Vilday had been present when White was murdered, and had taken part in the killing. She named Stephen and Tony Miller, Ronnie and John Actie, Tony Paris and Abdullahi as the other killers, and said Vilday had been responsible for cutting White's throat.

Vilday then gave a new statement on the same day, naming Stephen Miller, Ronnie and John Actie, Abdullahi and Paris as the killers, and saying that she and Psaila had both been forced to cut one of White's wrists to ensure their complicity and silence.

Stephen Miller's confession
Over a period of four days, Stephen Miller was interviewed on 19 occasions for a total of 13 hours; he was denied access to a solicitor for the first two interviews. Miller, who had a mental age of 11, confessed to the killing after making 307 denials. Miller also implicated the other men.

Murder trial
The trial commenced at Swansea Crown Court on 5 October 1989, but was interrupted on 26 February 1990 – after 82 days of evidence – by the sudden death of the judge, Mr Justice McNeill, from a heart attack. The subsequent retrial, also held at Swansea, commenced on 14 May 1990 before Mr Justice Leonard. It was at the time the longest murder trial in British legal history, lasting 197 days. On 22 November 1990, three of the five accused were found guilty of White's murder. Tony Paris, Yusef Abdullahi and Stephen Miller – who became known as the "Cardiff Three" – were each sentenced to life imprisonment. Cousins Ronnie and John Actie were acquitted of the murder; both had spent two years in custody. 17 years later, in September 2007, Ronnie was found dead in his back garden; police said there were no suspicious circumstances.

Evidence concerning the unreliability of the taped police confession of Stephen Miller was given by Icelandic-British academic, forensic psychologist and former detective Gísli Guðjónsson.

Doubts about the convictions
In early 1991 a number of journalists began to question the safety of the convictions and commercial television broadcaster Channel 4 transmitted their own investigation of the case in "Butetown: The Bridge And The Boys", part of their Black Bag magazine and documentary series aimed at Black and Asian viewers. In May 1991 two of the convicted men were granted leave to appeal their convictions, but the third, Stephen Miller, was refused. Satish Sekar, an investigative journalist specialising in crime and justice issues, had tracked down two witnesses not called at the trial who could provide an alibi for Miller's whereabouts at the time of the murder. Miller asked him if he would organise a new legal team to prepare his appeal. Sekar persuaded renowned solicitor Gareth Peirce to take on the case and handle the renewed application to appeal, and Peirce instructed Michael Mansfield QC to represent Miller in court. A public campaign to overturn the convictions, started by families and friends of the three men, began to receive high-profile support, including that of American community leader Al Sharpton, and Gerry Conlon, a recently exonerated member of the "Guildford Four". Further television documentaries followed in 1992, including "Unsafe Convictions" as part of the BBC documentary series Panorama and in 2021 the three-part BBC documentary A Killing in Tiger Bay, which included first-hand accounts from Miller, Paris and John Actie, as well as from some of the defence team and expert witness Gísli Guðjónsson.

Appeal
Their appeal was heard over four days in December 1992 and ended after the Court of Appeal listened to an audio recording of Stephen Miller's police interrogation. Mansfield argued that the trial judge "was wrong to admit the evidence of Mr Miller's police interviews contained on the tapes because it was tainted by the officers' 'oppressive' conduct." The interviews were, he said, "not a search for the truth but a police attempt to achieve—by any means short of violence—a concurrence between Mr Miller's account and Ms Vilday's." In his judgment, Lord Taylor said that the police had "bullied and hectored" Miller during a "travesty of an interview" and that  "short of physical violence, it is hard to conceive of a more hostile and intimidating approach by officers to a suspect." The truthfulness of Miller's admission was, according to Taylor, "irrelevant" as the nature of the questioning "required the interview to be rejected as evidence." He ordered copies of the recording to be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice as an "example of what we hope we shall never hear again in this court". All three men had their convictions declared "unsafe and unsatisfactory" and were released.

Yusef Abdullahi was treated for posttraumatic stress disorder after his release from prison and campaigned on behalf of other victims of miscarriages of justice and for the reopening of the investigation into White's murder. In 1996 he said: "Until it happens to you, no-one can have any idea what it's like to be convicted for a murder you didn't commit. We've been really messed up by what we've been through. We needed counselling, but no-one offered us any help. Being inside really did my head in." He died of a perforated ulcer in January 2011, aged 49.

Case reopened
In September 2000, the case was reopened. Forensic scientists led by Angela Gallop discovered fresh evidence, including a small trace of blood on the cellophane wrapper from a cigarette packet and a further ten traces of the same blood underneath several layers of paint on a skirting board at the crime scene. The killer was dubbed "Cellophane Man" by scientists and detectives. No match was found in the United Kingdom National DNA Database.

Identification of the murderer
In January 2002, after the development of the Second Generation Multiplex Plus (SGM+) test, forensic scientists, led by Professor Angela Gallop,  were finally able to obtain a reliable crime scene DNA profile. Hopes were also raised of solving the case when in the same year South Wales Police were able to positively identify a historical Port Talbot serial killer, Joe Kappen, using the pioneering approach of familial DNA searching. He had been unmasked as the killer after forensic samples from three 1973 murder victims were found to match his living son, and detectives on the White case hoped techniques could be used in their case. Using this process of familial searching, a partial match was eventually made with the profile of a 14-year-old youth who was known to the police but who had not been born at the time of the murder of White. This led to the arrest on 28 February 2003 of Jeffrey Gafoor, who was the youth's uncle. Gafoor was prosecuted for the murder in July 2003. On 4 July 2003, at Cardiff Crown Court, he pleaded guilty to White's murder and the judge, Mr Justice Royce, sentenced him to life imprisonment, with a minimum tariff of twelve years and eight months.

Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation
In November 2004, the IPCC announced that it would supervise a reinvestigation by the South Wales Police into the original police inquiry. On 13 April 2005, five retired police officers were arrested in connection with offences of false imprisonment, conspiring to pervert the course of justice and misconduct in public office. Four more retired police officers were arrested in connection with their roles in the original murder investigation on 21 April 2005. Along with the officers, a further 13 people were arrested in connection with evidence and information that they had provided in 1988 which had incriminated the three convicted men. On 19 May 2005, three serving police officers – a Detective Constable, a Constable and a Detective Sergeant – were arrested. As the investigation continued, over 30 arrests had been made by November 2005, 19 of whom were serving or retired police officers, including one Inspector.

Legal actions arising from the wrongful convictions

2008: Perjury trial
In February 2007, four witnesses who gave evidence at the original murder trial were charged with perjury. In December 2008, three of the accused – Angela Psaila, Leanne Vilday and Mark Grommek – were found guilty of committing perjury and each sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. The fourth, Paul Atkins, was deemed "unfit to stand trial." Mr Justice Maddison, sentencing, said: "It's been submitted on your behalf, accepted by the prosecution, and I accept it myself... you were seriously hounded, bullied, threatened, abused and manipulated by the police during a period of several months leading up to late 1988, as a result of which you felt compelled to agree to false accounts they suggested to you." However, perjury was "an offence which strikes at the heart of the system of the administration of justice."

2011: Police corruption trial
In March 2009, the Special Crime Division of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that there was "sufficient evidence" to prosecute three serving officers and ten former officers involved in the original investigation with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Two further witnesses in the original trial, Violet Perriam and Ian Massey, were also charged with perjury. In July 2011 the trial (R v Mouncher and Others)—the largest police corruption trial in British criminal history—of Chief Inspectors Graham Mouncher and Richard Powell, Chief Superintendent Thomas Page, Detectives Michael Daniels, Paul Jennings, Paul Stephen, Peter Greenwood and John Seaford, and Violet Perriam and Ian Massey, commenced at Swansea Crown Court. Massey was a convicted armed robber incarcerated at HM Prison Cardiff at the same time as Tony Paris and John Actie. He agreed to act as a police informant against the men in return for "representations made by the police" to his forthcoming Parole Board hearing, and gave evidence at their trial that Paris had confessed to White's murder in his presence.

During the trial, "concerns had been almost continually raised" by defence counsel relating to alleged non-disclosure by the prosecution of relevant documents. On 28 November 2011, Mr Justice Sweeney ordered the prosecution to produce to him a number of specific documents requested by the defence. Four of the documents were "found to be missing from their expected location" and an initial investigation by the police concluded that the documents had been destroyed in 2010 on the instructions of Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Coutts. As a result, Nicholas Dean QC, leading counsel for the prosecution, informed the court, on 1 December 2011, that "the prosecution can no longer sustain a position maintaining that the court and the defendants can have the required confidence in the disclosure process, the confidence that my Lord has referred to with all its importance to our criminal justice system. In those circumstances I formally offer no further evidence and will invite my Lord to direct the jury to return not guilty verdicts." The decision was made at the highest level, by Keir Starmer, at the time the Director of Public Prosecutions, Head of the Crown Prosecution Service and the most senior public prosecutor in England and Wales. The trial collapsed and South Wales Police immediately announced referral to the IPCC for further investigation. Starmer said: "Prosecutions will stand or fall on the quality of disclosure, and failings can leave the court with no choice but to acquit defendants who have a case to answer." On 17 January 2012, the missing documents were found in the office of DCS Coutts, still in the original box in which they had been sent from the IPCC.

Sekar responded to the acquittals by saying: "It is a very, very sad day for justice, as it suggests you cannot ever prosecute police officers successfully if you can't do it in a case like this." Tom Mangold, the BBC journalist and broadcaster who covered the case for Panorama in 1992 and 2012, called it "the biggest scandal in the history of British justice." Mangold also noted: "If the 13 accused Cardiff detectives had been found guilty, presumably all their previous cases — hundreds — would have had to be reopened and re-examined. Instead, they are now considering suing the South Wales Police." By the time the trial collapsed, all of the police officers charged had been allowed to retire.

2015: Horwell investigation
In February 2015, then Home Secretary Theresa May announced that an investigation into the collapse of the police corruption trial would be carried out, led by Richard Horwell QC. May, who rejected calls for a full public inquiry, said: "There are still unresolved questions surrounding the reasons why no-one was found responsible for this appalling miscarriage of justice." The inquiry was expected to present its findings in the summer of 2015 but this was delayed by the civil actions brought by former officers against South Wales Police.

2015: Civil action against South Wales Police
Following the collapse of the corruption trial, eight former police officers and seven others sued South Wales Police for damage to their reputations. The action alleged malicious prosecution, false imprisonment and misfeasance in public office by South Wales Police. On 14 June 2016, Mr Justice Wyn Williams ruled that the force "was within its rights to investigate the officers" and dismissed the case. He said: "I find it very difficult to understand how the accounts emerged as they did if no police officer was instrumental in what occurred. I have reached the clear conclusion that reasonable grounds existed from the start of LW3 [the inquiry into police corruption] to suspect that the untruthful accounts which the core four [Psaila, Vilday, Grommek and Atkins] gave about the involvement of the original defendants in Lynette's murder were brought about by criminal conduct on the part of police officers involved in LW1 [the original murder investigation]. In my judgment, it was permissible for LW3 officers to suspect that officers who had been part of LW1 had engaged in a conspiracy to mould and manipulate evidence." Furthermore, the explanation given by Chief Superintendent Thomas Page regarding documents that he had burned in his garden prior to his arrest, was, according to the judge, "open to considerable doubt".
The Reversible Destiny Foundation is an artists-architects-poets group formed by Madeline Gins and Shusaku Arakawa. The Foundation’s work concerns the body its simultaneously specific and non-specific relation to its surroundings. The philosophical findings of what a body or person is direct their architectural theories and works. The Foundation plans to collaborate with practitioners in a wide range of disciplines, including but not limited to experimental biology, neuroscience, quantum physics, experimental phenomenology, and medicine. Their architectural projects have included residences, parks, and plans for housing complexes and neighborhoods.

History and philosophy

Beginning in 1963, Arakawa and Madeline Gins collaborated to produce visionary, boundary-defying art and architecture. Their work, The Mechanism of Meaning, the first large-scale art-science research project, has been exhibited widely throughout the world and has influenced later developments. The Mechanism of Meaning was published as a book in 1971. In 1987, as a means of financing the design and construction of works of procedural architecture that draw on The Mechanism of Meaning, extending its theoretical implications into the environment, Arakawa and Gins founded the Architectural Body Research Foundation. The Reversible Destiny Foundation was formed in 2010.

Key ideas and terminology

Architectural body

An architectural body is a unit of measurement: Human Body + Its Immediate Surrounds. Contrasted to conventional notions of the body that purport clear boundaries, the architectural body holds that boundaries can only be suggested. From the term 'architectural body,' three hypotheses arise:

 Architectural body hypothesis or sited awareness hypothesis: What stems from the body, by way of awareness, should be held to be of it. Any site at which a person deems an X to exist should be considered a contributing segment of her awareness.
 Insufficiently procedural bioscleave hypothesis: It is because we are creatures of an insufficiently procedural bioscleave that the human lot remains untenable.
 Closely argued built-discourse: Adding carefully sequenced sets of architectural procedures (closely argued ones) to bioscleave will, by making it more procedurally sufficient, reconfigure supposed inevitability.

Organism that persons

The phrase 'organism that persons' describes the impressions an organism expresses, and thereby resulting in the organism being the type of organism it is. As an ontological phenomenon, it is manifested in all organisms; for example, a dog is an organism that dogs and a cat is an organism that cats.

Procedural architecture

Procedural architecture is defined in Architectural Body (2002). Understanding procedural architecture is clarified by the notion of procedural knowing, i.e. the reduction of steps necessary to complete a routine, and making those steps a subroutine of that procedure. Walking, talking, and eating are examples of procedural knowing.

Procedural architecture brings into question an occupant’s procedures and steers her to minutely examine the actions, or subroutines, she takes, thereby causing her to doubt herself long enough to find a way to reinvent herself.

Conference

There have been three conferences. Established thinkers from diverse intellectual disciplines, including such names as Lawrence Alloway, Robert Creeley, Italo Calvino, Carter Ratcliff, Donald Kuspit, Arthur Danto, Suzanne Blier, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jean-Francois Lyotard,  Andrew Benjamin, Ed Keller, Kay Itoi and Nicholas Piombino, Mark C. Taylor, George Lakoff, Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Reuben Baron, Hideo Kawamoto, Shuzo Takeguchi and Erin Manning, have all pondered the significance of Arakawa and Gins’ output with reference to philosophy of mind and language, visual art and aesthetics, poetry and literary theory, cognitive science, architecture, dance and movement, social and ecological psychology—and many other fields.

Completed projects

Bioscleave House (Lifespan Extending Villa) 

(East Hampton, New York, 2000–2008)

The Bioscleave House is the first architectural project that the Reversible Destiny Foundation completed in the United States. Its construction spanned almost a decade, encountering obstacles from its initial funder, and ultimately cost over two million dollars. The house has four rooms, a free-form living space and walls made of various materials, such as metal and translucent polycarbonate. There are no internal doors.
The room has levels and makes the visitor feel like they are in two places at once. That violates the idea of what a room should be, and by changing the idea of how architecture should work, people may be changing their ideas about how life should work. The Bioscleave House draws its name from the way a body holds, or cleaves, to these surroundings.

Reversible Destiny Houses – Mitaka

(Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan Completed October 2005)

The Reversible Destiny Lofts – Mitaka (In Memory of Helen Keller) is a nine-unit multiple dwelling. It was first completed as an example of procedural architecture put to residential use. These lofts reflexively articulate the residents’ operative tendencies and coordinating skills essential to and determinative of human thought and behavior; which means to say, the lofts manage, by virtue of how they are constructed, to reveal to their residents the ins and outs of what makes a person, in this case the resident. This is the same set of tendencies and skills to which Arakawa and Madeline Gins gave diagrammatic form in their decades-long research project The Mechanism of Meaning.

Built by Takenaka Corp., a leading Japanese contractor, the apartments actually meet every building-code requirement. Through its construction, the Reversible Destiny Lofts – Mitaka (In Memory of Helen Keller) invite optimistic and constructive action to help residents live long and ample lives.

Site of Reversible Destiny – Yoro 

(Yoro, Gifu Prefecture, Japan, 1993–1995)

Opened in October 1995, the Site of Reversible Destiny - Yoro Park is an "experience park" conceived on the theme of encountering the unexpected. By guiding visitors through various unexpected experiences as they walk through its component areas, the site offers them opportunities to rethink their physical and spiritual orientation to the world.  The site consists of a main pavilion, the Critical Resemblance House, the Elliptical Field and the Reversible Destiny Office.

The Critical Resemblance House has a roof that is shaped as a map of Gifu Prefecture, offering visitors a range of perceptual and cognitive experiences. The interior, a maze-like configuration that can be entered and exited at numerous points, has household furniture―sofas, beds, kitchen sinks―arranged in corresponding pairs on the floor, under the floor, and on the ceiling.

The Elliptical Field, which is a large, bowl-shaped basin, consists of nine pavilions (each a reproduction of a segment of the Critical Resemblance House), an array of complementary mounds and hollows, five maps of varying sizes of the Japanese archipelago, and, weaving in between all of these, an intricate network of 148 paths. The largest of the Japan maps, which extends across the entire Field, is planted with 24 species of medicinal herbs that give it a gradually changing complexion from season to season.

The Reversible Destiny Office was added in April 1997. It houses information about the site, Arakawa's drawings and other works, and screens a documentary about the site's construction.

Ubiquitous Site * Nagi’s Ryoanji * Architectural Body

(Nagi Museum Of Contemporary Art, Japan 1994)

The small entrance room, the stairway, and the cylindrical room present an exercise in perception and physical experience. The balance between self-consciousness and perception of one's body is broken down, the "axis" shifts, consciousness leans out, is "doubled," and "something" emerges. This "something" existed in the perceptions of the newborn child that has been forgotten in growing up. People's roots are found in what might be described as "insecurity," "faith," or "heart." It might be called "nostalgia," a certain "atmosphere." The artists speak of artificially creating "instant nostalgia." It is artificially constructed, using something "given," breaking through the logjam of words found in modern thought. They conduct experiments which deal more with the possibilities of physical structures and the human body than of words. It is up to the viewer to determine what is made to happen or actually happens here, and what can be gained from it.

The offshore off-licence is the name coined by the media to describe a 2004 venture to bring "tax- and duty-free" alcohol and cigarettes to Teesside, England, by selling the imported goods from a boat anchored just outside the UK's 12-mile limit.  Two businessmen, Phil Berriman and Trevor Lyons, a maritime law expert, used the latter's 72-foot staysail schooner Rich Harvest to transport large quantities of cigarettes and spirits from Heligoland (a tiny island in the German Bight, off Jutland, which is outside the EU VAT area) to Hartlepool. The vessel was anchored a little more than 12 miles offshore, and people from Hartlepool came out in private boats to buy the untaxed goods. Customers would then ostensibly be allowed to bring their purchases into the UK using their duty-free allowance.

After a storm, the Rich Harvest put into port, flying the yellow Q flag to notify HM Customs & Excise (now HM Revenue & Customs) officers that dutiable goods were aboard.  Customs were unsure what to do, and at first merely sought to make the vessel secure, to prevent unlawful unloading.  The next day, a higher authority ordered the vessel to leave port within 36 hours, but just as the vessel was about to leave, Customs changed their mind and refused to allow the vessel and its cargo to depart.  The cargo was seized and taken to a bonded Customs warehouse.  Some weeks later, Customs decided to return the goods, but demanded that they be exported immediately.  The goods were loaded onto a different vessel, a former Trinity House support vessel called the Cornish Maiden. The much more valuable Rich Harvest was not used this time, in case it became liable to seizure and forfeiture.

The Cornish Maiden (which belonged to Berriman) motored to a position 12 miles off Hartlepool, where it anchored and made ready for trade.  By this time, a  Customs cutter was waiting, and stayed in attendance throughout daylight hours.  Hartlepool residents who came out to buy goods were followed back to shore by a Customs RHIB from the cutter. Potential buyers were scared off when Customs then announced that they would "seize any boat that visited" the Cornish Maiden.  From then on, no sales were made, except to journalists and cameramen from national newspapers. These media people bought token amounts of goods, but on arrival onshore, these goods were either seized or extra duty demanded.  There were no further sales, and after the cutter gave warning that another storm was imminent, the Cornish Maiden packed up and headed for port.

The cargo was then seized again by Customs, who had obtained a magistrates' court order for the cargo to be impounded.  On appeal at Middlesbrough Crown Court, the judge held that magistrates were wrong, and ordered the goods to be returned, saying both that the "offshore off-licence" was not unlawful and that HMRC's seizure of the cargo was wrong-headed and unconscionable.  Customs appealed to the divisional court for an appellate review.  On behalf of the venture, barrister Jeremy White relied on the Factortame case, arguing that HMRC's import regulations were arbitrary, restrictive and void for conflicting with the higher authority of EU law; but the divisional court, reminiscent of the majority in Liversidge v Anderson, rejected this claim and ordered the case to be reheard in Middlesbrough.  At this second Crown Court hearing, a new judge took a rather different view, holding that Customs had been entitled to seize the cargo. Customs claimed that a duty-free allowance could be claimed only if one had been abroad.

More recently, the schooner was stolen and taken to Brazil, where it was loaded with cocaine. It then sailed to the Cape Verde islands, where the crew (who claimed to be unaware of the presence of any contraband cargo) were arrested, convicted and given heavy jail sentences.
Brentwood is a residential subdivision in the Hiram Clarke community, in Southwest Houston, Texas. Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post said in 2001 that Brentwood was "a medium-size, lower-middle class neighborhood[...]"

History
Originally Brentwood was a White community, settled in the 1960s. Claudia Kolker of the Houston Press said that the first generation of settlers, who were White, as well as the second and third, who were Black, came for the "small-town quality." By the mid-1970s the community was changing into an African-American neighborhood.  Kolker said "the transition by most accounts was fairly gentle -- and if anything, scaled Brentwood even further up economically." Kolker added "Over the years, most of the white residents moved out and Brentwood became a sought-after prize for successful Black Houstonians tired of the city. And in contrast to the stereotype of what happens when a neighborhood changes hue, Brentwood became if anything more pristine, more fiercely nurtured, as its Black residents multiplied." During the transition period there was a conflict between area White people and area Black people who wanted to assume control of a local church. The church later evolved into a multimillion-dollar organization.

As the community matured, some portions decayed. Rod Paige, a man who would later become the superintendent of the Houston Independent School District and the Secretary of Education, spearheaded a move to excise a dump from the edge of the community. The Texas Supreme Court eventually sided with the residents. In the 1990s the Brentwood Baptist Church, a local church, suggested housing AIDS victims on the property. This led to controversy and paranoia within the neighborhood. Some residents felt that the church had betrayed their community, and moved to keep their families away from the AIDS victims.

As of 1996, the subdivision has a lot of stability in its pool of residents since relatively few people moved in and out of the community. This differed from nearby areas which have many rental units, such as Glen Iris, Meredith Manor, and Pamela Heights. Stanley O'Bryant, a realty agent of B E Henson & Associates and a letter carrier, said that Brentwood was "a very stable neighborhood. Hardly anybody moves." By 1996 the Hiram Clarke Civic Club had prevented the establishment of a correctional facility and an animal shelter on Brentwood's periphery.

In late August 1997, after legal wrangling, the AIDS housing opened. By 1999, the controversy over the church's AIDS victim housing cooled when the community's perception of the disease as a disease for White people waned and the community recognized AIDS as a problem affecting the African American community.

By 2002 Brentwood residents lobbied against the installation of an affordable housing project.

Cityscape
Brentwood is near West Airport Boulevard and Hiram Clarke Road. Brentwood is  from the intersection of the 610 Loop and U.S. Route 59 (Southwest Freeway). Most houses in Brentwood have one story each, and are made of brick.

In 1995 Claudia Kolker of the Houston Press described Brentwood as "pristine" and "orderly" which contains "decorously maintained homes." Kolker said "It's the very intimacy between these places that impresses a visitor: the way the ranch-style houses nudge against the grade school grounds, and how the playground stretches toward the parking lot that fronts the church. Almost a physical definition of the word community, this piece of Brentwood seems an icon of a time when home, education and religion all clasped together into one, universally accepted whole." In regards to the surrounding area, Kolker said "a skein of high tension wires laces a long pasture nibbled by cows. Buildings are few, and sound seems somehow muffled out here along Hiram Clarke Road, the thoroughfare that borders these fields. Here in the southwest suburbs, even the grimy Eagle Food Mart, stocked with requisite ATM machines, gas pumps and parking lot loiterers, retains the air of a small country store." Kolker said "Today, to pass the redwood "Brentwood" sign on Airport Street beside Eagle Food Mart is to enter a lapidary haven of gemlike lawns, immaculate houses and burnished cars" and that the local elementary school is "a brief walk from streets with storybook names such as Wuthering Heights, White Heather and Regency." She concluded "While Brentwood's population has changed over the past three decades, its charms have remained much the same."

In 1996 few of the houses had burglar bars. Houses had few "for sale" signs and lawns were manicured. Many lawns had "poodle bushes." Around that time houses were listed for sale in the range $42,000 ($ in today's money) to $74,900 ($ in today's money). The houses were more inexpensive than similar houses in Fondren Southwest and sections of Missouri City.

As of 2007 most houses have burglar bars, and many have placed cameras at the corners of their houses. One woman installed motion sensors, rigged her doors and windows, and booby trapped her backyard gate.

Government and infrastructure
The Hiram Clarke Civic Club is an area civic club that covers the community. Covers Brentwood and one other subdivisions, with almost 1,200 households living in the two subdivisions combined. As of 2003 it had 175 members who paid dues. Matt Schwartz of the Houston Chronicle said "Even with dues of $50 a year, enforcing restrictions with letters from attorneys or lawsuits can quickly drain resources."

Culture
Brentwood Baptist Church is located in Brentwood. It originally had a small congregation; as of 1996 its membership had over 10,000 people. Katherine Feser of the Houston Chronicle said in 1996 that the church "anchored" Brentwood. In 1995 Claudia Kolker of the Houston Press said that Brentwood Baptist Church does not function as a community church, and that many residents go to church in the original "wards" where they had been raised.

Education
Residents are zoned to the Houston Independent School District. Hobby Elementary School is located inside the neighborhood. Residents are zoned to Hobby, Lawson Middle School (formerly Dowling Middle School), and Madison High School.

Residents are also zoned to the Houston Community College system.

Parks and recreation
Residents are served by Brentwood Park, a City of Houston park.

Notable residents
 Rod Paige (would later become the superintendent of the Houston Independent School District and the United States Secretary of Education) - He served as the president of the Hiram Clarke Civic Club.
 Paige lives in a one-story brick and wood house with a driveway and a garage. Its front windows have tinted glass. Paige bought the house after he moved to Houston in the early 1970s. As of 2001 Paige still resides in this house; he said that he has no interest in living elsewhere. Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post described Paige's house as "modest".
XIV Corps was a British infantry corps during the First World War. During the Second World War the identity was recreated for deceptive purposes.

First World War
XIV Corps was formed in France on 3 January 1916 under Lieutenant-General the Earl of Cavan. It took part in the Battle of the Somme in 1916; a year later it fought through the Battle of Passchendaele before being redeployed to Italy in November 1917.

Second World War

In the Second World War, the XIV corps was notionally reformed in North Africa in late 1943 as part the cover plan for the Anzio landings. Initially assigned to the British Twelfth Army, the corps was later depicted as being under the command of the United States Seventh Army and finally under the 15th Army Group as the theater reserve for the Italian campaign

Insignia

The corps insignia in World War II was that of a black wolf's head, with a lolling red tongue superimposed on a white square.

During winter in Gotham City, a financially struggling man named Bob, picks up a package full of money from a trash can; it is implied he is delivering the money as a bagman for the Joker. Almost immediately, Batman (referred to as Scrooge by the narrator), drops from above, attacks Bob and demands to know where the Joker is. When the terrified Bob tells him that he does not know, Batman lets him go, but secretly attaches a tracer to him as he runs home to his son, Tim, who lives with him in a shabby apartment. Like the original Tiny Tim, Tim is in poor health and has a disabled leg. Although disabled, Tim is good-spirited and attempts to brighten up their drab apartment with a makeshift Christmas tree made of junk items. Bob is too terrified of the Joker (and Batman) to share any holiday cheer. Lurking outside the apartment, Batman assumes the Joker will come to retrieve the lost money and intends to use Bob (and indirectly, Tim) as bait to capture the Joker.

Back at the Batcave, Bruce watches Bob and his son, informing Alfred that he intends for the father to be arrested so his son will be too terrified to follow in his footsteps. During this, Bruce constantly hacks and coughs, implying that he is catching a cold. Alfred then reminds Bruce that a similar plan led to his former partner Robin (Jason Todd) losing his life. Afterwards, Bruce sees a vision of Robin (playing the role of Jacob Marley), which disturbs him throughout the rest of the night. He remembers earlier days fighting crime alongside Robin in colorful 60s-style uniforms, in contrast to his current mostly-black combat suit.

Batman responds to the Bat-Signal, where Commissioner Gordon tells Batman that Catwoman (playing the role of the Ghost of Christmas Past) has tipped off the GCPD that she has information about the Joker, but demands that she only talks to Batman. Confronting Catwoman, Batman discovers, as he suspected, that she was lying and only called him so she could "play with him", under nostalgia of their adventures together. Batman bluntly tells Catwoman he was never "playing", upon which she takes off leaping between rooftops. Batman chases Catwoman before falling several stories to the ground, as she watches wide-eyed from a distance.

Lying semi-conscious in an alley, Batman is confronted by the glowing figure of Superman (playing the role of the Ghost of Christmas Present), who uses X-ray vision to determine Batman is coming down with pneumonia, though Batman shrugs it off. Superman then takes Batman into the skies to watch ordinary Gothamites preparing for Christmas; Batman scoffs at his sentimentality. They then stop to watch Bob and Tim, then Commissioner Gordon talking with an officer about their differing opinions of Batman. Advising Batman to take time off and recover his health, Superman drops Batman off at the Batmobile, then flies off into the night.

Batman attempts to enter the Batmobile, which explodes upon activation and knocks him out. The Joker (playing the role of the Ghost of Christmas Future) arrives and drags the still-comatose Batman to a graveyard to be thrown alive into an open grave. While buried, Batman has a vision where Gotham is plunged into chaos after his death, with Gordon tried and convicted for cooperating with Batman's extra-legal activities, and civilians killing criminals in cold blood, mirroring Batman's ruthless behavior and black-and-white view of the world after Jason Todd's death.

Realizing what he has become, Batman digs himself free from the grave and saves Bob and Tim from the Joker, who has arrived at the apartment to brutally recover his money. The Joker holds Bob at gunpoint as Batman smashes in the apartment window. Bob manages to grab the Joker's gun and holds the latter at gunpoint, threatening to kill him, but Batman urges him to show his son the man he truly is: not a killer but a man who will protect his son. The Joker goads Bob to pull the trigger, but he lowers the gun and the Joker is arrested. Learning a new lesson in life, Batman returns to the Batcave and sleeps. Alfred pulls a blanket over him.

The next day, Bruce Wayne gives Bob an established job, a raise, medical coverage and an actual Christmas tree. The narrator is revealed to be Bob himself, relating the tale to Tim and asking him what he thought the moral of the story was. The story ends with a now-healthy Tim leaping Batman-style in a snowy Gotham street.

Reception
Rob Patey of Ain't It Cool News called Batman: Noël "an instant classic", complimenting Bermejo's "kinetic artwork" and his ability to keep the story grounded while deftly transcending reality. Shawn Morrissey of Outer Realm Comics was less impressed saying that it "is a good read, but it's all thanks to the source material" and that the overly realistic art ruins the comic book fantasy.

In 2011, Tai made good progress by defeating the top ranked player. She defeated Zhu Lin in the first round of the Australian Open, Wang Xin in the first round of Indonesia Open, and in July, she beat the former world champion Lu Lan in the quarter-finals of the U.S. Open which was a Grand Prix Gold tournament, and beat World Junior silver medalists Sayaka Sato in the final, which became the first international title she won at the age of 17. She also reached the semi-finals of the Canada, Vietnam, and French Open, where in France, she defeated China's number 1 Wang Shixian in the quarter-finals.

In the early half of 2012 season, her best achievements were the reaching the semi-finals in the All England Open, and ranked as world number 16.

2017: Asian champion and fifth straight Superseries title 
Before the 2017 season started, Tai announced that she would skip that year's World Championships in Glasgow. Tai decided to attend the 2017 Summer Universiade not only out of a desire to earn a title for her home country but also for the bigger picture. Since the Summer Universiade was by far the biggest sporting event held in her home country, only second to the Olympic Games, Tai wanted to welcome the world to see Taiwan.

In her first match, she defeated Zhang 21–15, 21–17; lost to Sindhu 21–14, 16–21, 18–21. However, she retired with an injury in her third group stage match against Yamaguchi after losing the first game 17–21 and trailing 12–11 in the second game. Tai did not reveal the nature of the injury or how it occurred.

In 2019, she reached the quarter-final stage of the Malaysia Masters, losing to the same opponent of last year and arch-rival Ratchanok Intanon in straight games. In March, she advanced to the final of the All England Open for the third straight time, however she unexpectedly lost to the Chinese Chen Yufei, after 11 straight victories over her. She came back and claimed back to back titles at the Malaysia Open and Singapore Open; beating the Japanese Akane Yamaguchi and Nozomi Okuhara respectively in the finals in straight games. In July, she was unable to defend her title at the Indonesia Open, after losing in the semi-finals to Akane Yamaguchi. Her jinx at the World Championships continued further after she lost to P. V. Sindhu of India in the quarter-finals in 3 games 21–12, 21–23, 19–21. This was her 5th straight quarter-final loss at the World Championships.

She avenged her loss in the Group Stage to Nozomi Okuhara in the semi-final and reached the final again after three years. Despite a good performance, she couldn't stand right against Chen Yufei and lost the final with 21–12, 12–21, 17–21 scoreline.

2020–2021: Third All England title and BWF Female Player of the Year 
Tai commenced the year by competing at the Malaysia Masters as the first seed. She finished as runner-up after losing to Chen Yufei in straight games. In her fourth straight All England Open final this year, she won the coveted title for the third time, thereby becoming only the second female player after Ye Zhaoying (1996–99) to clinch three titles by contesting 4 consecutive finals in this tournament. In the final, she beat Chen Yufei with the score of 21–19, 21–15, with this, she avenged her last year's defeat to Chen at this stage. She had to settle for the second best at the two consecutive Thailand Open super 1000 events in January, 2021 after losing to Carolina Marín in both occasions in straight games. She finally defeated Marín at the BWF World Tour Finals while contesting her 5th end-of-season championships final, and winning it for the third time. She claimed victory over her opponent in three games. Tai has been named the BWF Female Player of the Year 2020–2021.
Tai Tzu Ying won the All England 2020 and then struck a rich vein of form at the three-tournament Asian Leg in January 2021, making all three finals, and clinching the BWF World Tour Finals 2020. Tai then made the final of the Tokyo Olympics, and won a silver medal after being defeated by the top seed Chen Yufei in an intense match, 18–21, 21–19, 18–21.

Playing style 
Tai plays an offensive game, with many calling her style unpredictable and often spontaneous. She is a very adventurous player with a disguised nature of shots, seemingly able to hit the shuttle from just about anywhere with a great range of shots and angles. Also remarkable is her very relaxed hitting action.

She has a strong backhand and good net-play, while her biggest fault is being inconsistent at times. Tai also has strong stamina and is very athletic.
Tai herself said that she does not follow a certain play or style, and focuses on herself rather than her opponent or any strategies. Tai has clocked fast smashes, with one of the fastest recorded being 360 km/h at the 2016 All England Open quarter-finals, despite her preference of playing slowly to set up shots.

Tai's prodigious talent and deceptive shot-making has earned compliments of many, including BWF commentator Gillian Clark, who often compliments her talented shot-making and has said that Tai is one of the best players to watch in women's singles.

The Treason Act 1536 (28 Hen. 8 c. 18) was an Act passed by the English Parliament during the reign of King Henry VIII of England. It made it high treason to marry or become engaged to the King's children, sisters, paternal aunts, or his nieces or nephews without the King's written permission, or "to deflower any of them being unmarried." It was also treason for any of the same relatives to participate in such treason.

The Act was repealed by the Treason Act 1547 in the first year of the reign of Henry's successor, Edward VI.
The Ukrainian Carpathians are a section of the Eastern Carpathians, within the borders of modern Ukraine. They are located in the southwestern corner of Western Ukraine, within administrative territories of four Ukrainian regions (oblasts), covering northeastern part of Zakarpattia Oblast, southwestern part of Lviv Oblast, southern half of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and western half of Chernivtsi Oblast.   

They are stretching in a general northwest–southeast direction, starting at the tripartite border point of Ukraine with Poland and Slovakia, and continuing towards the Ukrainian border with Romania. In terms of geological classification, Ukrainian Carpathians belong to two distinctive categories, with the major part belonging to the Outer Eastern Carpathians and the minor part to the Inner Eastern Carpathians. 
  
Within different regional and national traditions, there are several overlapping variants of divisions and designations for various Eastern Carpathian mountain ranges. Within the wider scope of the Ukrainian Carpathians, a section of the Outer Eastern Carpathians spanning the southeastern corner of Poland, the northeastern corner of Slovakia, and the western part of Ukraine is commonly known as the Eastern Beskids, while in Slovakia the term Meadowed Mountains is also used for the same mountain range. The scope of those terms varies in accordance with different traditions and classifications.

Carel Diederic Aernout baron van Lynden (born 31 December 1954) is a Dutch-British journalist with over twenty years experience as a war correspondent in the Middle East, Northern Ireland and the Balkans.

Career
Lynden began his journalism career in 1979 at the Haagsche Courant. In September 1980 he was one of the few Western journalists in Iraq when Saddam Hussein's attack on Iran opened. After this he worked as a freelance for BBC Radio, The Observer and The Washington Post. He then invested much time and energy in the anti- Soviet Resistance in Afghanistan. In 1982 he became The Observer correspondent in Beirut, where he was a journalist covering the civil war in Lebanon and other regional conflicts.
 
After moving to London he became involved in setting up the 24-hour news channel BSkyB. He would remain active over thirteen years. First as an anchor (presenter) and then as a senior foreign correspondent. In that role he covered among others the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan, the Romanian Revolution in 1989, the Gulf War in 1990–91, the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the Palestinian Intifada. For his reporting on the war in Bosnia in 1993, he received two international awards. From 2002 to mid-2008 he was professor of communication and journalism associated with the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG) in Blagoevgrad.
He has also lectured at the John Cabot University in Rome, Italy, but is now a lecturer at Leiden University College The Hague.

Aernout van Lynden had a cameo as himself in the movie Behind Enemy Lines.

Private life
Aernout van Lynden was married to diplomat Henriette van Lynden-Leijten, who died in November 2010.
The TeST TST-14 Bonus is a Czech high-wing, T-tailed, two-seats-in-tandem glider and motor glider, designed and produced by TeST Gliders.

Design and development
The TST-14 motor glider was designed for private owner and flying school use and as such features wing tip wheels that allow independent taxiing and take-off.

The TST-14 is constructed from composite materials, with the forward-swept wing a ribless composite sandwich structure. Each wing weighs  and has a single spar made with a carbon fibre composite flange plate and a polyurethane foam/fibreglass composite web plate. Glidepath control is by upper surface air brakes made from aluminium. The motor glider version is powered by a retractable  Rotax 503UL two-stroke powerlant. Extension and retraction of the engine is fully automatic, controlled with two cockpit-mounted buttons and actuated by two electric servo motors. The landing gear consists of dual fuselage-mounted tandem mainwheels and wing tip-mounted wheels.

The aircraft was type certified to the Joint Aviation Authorities JAR 22 standard for gliders on 10 Dec 2001. The TST-14 was not certified in the United States as the company explains, "due to the expense involved". The aircraft can be registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration as a Special Light Sport Aircraft glider or in the Experimental - racing/exhibition category.

Howard Mary Breslin (23 December 1912 – 30 May 1964) was an American novelist and radio script writer. He mainly wrote novels of historical fiction and is most notable for The Tamarack Tree and "Bad Time at Honda", a short story that was the basis of the film Bad Day at Black Rock. He also published under the nom de plume Michael Niall.

Biography
Howard Mary Breslin was born in New York City to Kathryn Veronica (née Connelly) and Thomas Niall Breslin, both parents of Irish descent. His father and mother met each other when they both worked at the famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He was raised in Manhattan with his older brother Thomas A. Breslin and younger sister Irene Mary Breslin. Aunts and uncles often lived with the family during his childhood. Breslin lived most of his life in New York City. At the age of ten he started reading the series Rover Boys by Edward Stratemeyer and it inspired him to write.

He graduated from Regis High School in 1932, and then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree summa cum laude in 1936 from Manhattan College, in Riverdale, Bronx, New York. While at Manhattan College he was an editor for The Quadrangle, the college newspaper and editor of the yearbook.

After college Breslin applied at every newspaper in New York City, but could not get a job. He went to work as a writer for radio programs. His most notable programs included Off the Air (starring Shirley Booth) and The Honest Captain, both of which he co-wrote with Knowles Entrikin. The two alternated each week on a unique script for the show. He also wrote Mayor of the Town, starring Lionel Barrymore. Along with David Howard, Breslin wrote the show for Parker Fennelly with the character Titus Moody on Allen's Alley.

He left a lucrative job writing radio scripts, making $750 a week by 1946 (an estimated $9757.54 in 2018 dollars), to become a novelist because he was unhappy. He had published The Piper's Son but with limited success. To make ends meet he published short stories.

In 1946 he wrote the short story "Bad Time at Honda", and it appeared in The American Magazine in January 1947, with full-color illustrations by Robert Fawcett. That story became the film Bad Day at Black Rock, the script adapted by Don McGuire and Millard Kaufman, directed by John Sturges, and starring Spencer Tracy.

The Tamarack Tree (1947) set Breslin on his path as a novelist, earning him a Literary Guild and receiving critical acclaim.

He used his Irish family and childhood for his novel Let Go of Yesterday (1950) which is set in the Irish South Bronx.

Another one of his short stories was the basis for the film Platinum High School (1960; MGM), directed by Charles Haas, with the screenplay by Robert Smith, and starring Mickey Rooney.

At the end of his life he was living at 331 East 71st Street in Manhattan. Breslin died after a short illness at St. Luke's Hospital, New York City.

Ånge IF is a Swedish football club located in Ånge.

Background 
Ånge IF currently plays in Division 5 which is the seventh tier of Swedish football. They play their home matches at the Ånge Idrottsplats in Ånge.

The club is affiliated to Medelpads Fotbollförbund.

Season to season  

* League restructuring in 2006 resulted in a new division being created at Tier 3 and subsequent divisions dropping a level.
The pelvis (plural pelves or  pelvises) is the lower part of the trunk, between the abdomen and the thighs (sometimes also called pelvic region), together with its embedded skeleton (sometimes also called bony pelvis, or pelvic skeleton).

The pelvic region of the trunk includes the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity (the space enclosed by the bony pelvis), the pelvic floor, below the pelvic cavity, and the perineum, below the pelvic floor. The pelvic skeleton is formed in the area of the back, by the sacrum and the coccyx and anteriorly and to the left and right sides, by a pair of hip bones.

The two hip bones connect the spine with the lower limbs. They are attached to the sacrum posteriorly, connected to each other anteriorly, and joined with the two femurs at the hip joints. The gap enclosed by the bony pelvis, called the pelvic cavity, is the section of the body underneath the abdomen and mainly consists of the reproductive organs (sex organs) and the rectum, while the pelvic floor at the base of the cavity assists in supporting the organs of the abdomen.

In mammals, the bony pelvis has a gap in the middle, significantly larger in females than in males. Their young pass through this gap when they are born.

Structure
The pelvic region of the trunk is the lower part of the trunk, between the abdomen and the thighs. It includes several structures: the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity, the pelvic floor, and the perineum. The bony pelvis (pelvic skeleton) is the part of the skeleton embedded in the pelvic region of the trunk. It is subdivided into the pelvic girdle and the pelvic spine. The pelvic girdle is composed of the appendicular hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) oriented in a ring, and connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. The pelvic spine consists of the sacrum and coccyx.
 the pelvic cavity, typically defined as a small part of the space enclosed by the bony pelvis, delimited by the pelvic brim above and the pelvic floor below; alternatively, the pelvic cavity is sometimes also defined as the whole space enclosed by the pelvic skeleton, subdivided into:
 the greater (or false) pelvis, above the pelvic brim
 the lesser (or true) pelvis, below the pelvic brim
 the pelvic floor (or pelvic diaphragm), below the pelvic cavity
 the perineum, below the pelvic floor

Pelvic bone

The pelvic skeleton is formed posteriorly (in the area of the back), by the sacrum and the coccyx and laterally and anteriorly (forward and to the sides), by a pair of hip bones. 
Each hip bone consists of three sections: ilium, ischium, and pubis. During childhood, these sections are separate bones, joined by the triradiate cartilage. During puberty, they fuse together to form a single bone.

Pelvic cavity 

The pelvic cavity is a body cavity that is bounded by the bones of the pelvis and which primarily contains reproductive organs and the rectum.

A distinction is made between the lesser or true pelvis inferior to the terminal line, and the greater or false pelvis above it.  The pelvic inlet or superior pelvic aperture, which leads into the lesser pelvis, is bordered by the promontory, the arcuate line of ilium, the iliopubic eminence, the pecten of the pubis, and the upper part of the pubic symphysis.  The pelvic outlet or inferior pelvic aperture is the region between the subpubic angle or pubic arch, the ischial tuberosities and the coccyx.

 Ligaments: obturator membrane, inguinal ligament (lacunar ligament, iliopectineal arch)
Alternatively, the pelvis is divided into three planes: the inlet, midplane, and outlet.

Pelvic floor 

The pelvic floor has two inherently conflicting functions: One is to close the pelvic and abdominal cavities and bear the load of the visceral organs; the other is to control the openings of the rectum and urogenital organs that pierce the pelvic floor and make it weaker.  To achieve both these tasks, the pelvic floor is composed of several overlapping sheets of muscles and connective tissues.

The pelvic diaphragm is composed of the levator ani and the coccygeus muscle.  These arise between the symphysis and the ischial spine and converge on the coccyx and the anococcygeal ligament which spans between the tip of the coccyx and the anal hiatus.  This leaves a slit for the anal and urogenital openings.  Because of the width of the genital aperture, which is wider in females, a second closing mechanism is required.  The urogenital diaphragm consists mainly of the deep transverse perineal which arises from the inferior ischial and pubic rami and extends to the urogenital hiatus.  The urogenital diaphragm is reinforced posteriorly by the superficial transverse perineal.

The external anal and urethral sphincters close the anus and the urethra.  The former is surrounded by the bulbospongiosus which narrows the vaginal introitus in females and surrounds the corpus spongiosum in males.  Ischiocavernosus squeezes blood into the corpus cavernosum penis and clitoridis.

Variation

Modern humans are to a large extent characterized by bipedal locomotion and large brains.  Because the pelvis is vital to both locomotion and childbirth, natural selection has been confronted by two conflicting demands: a wide birth canal and locomotion efficiency, a conflict referred to as the "obstetrical dilemma".  The female pelvis, or gynecoid pelvis, has evolved to its maximum width for childbirth—a wider pelvis would make women unable to walk.  In contrast, human male pelvises are not constrained by the need to give birth and therefore are more optimized for bipedal locomotion.

The principal differences between male and female true and false pelvis include:
 The female pelvis is larger and broader than the male pelvis which is taller, narrower, and more compact. The female pelvis is lighter and thinner than the male pelvis.
 The female inlet is larger and oval in shape, while the male sacral promontory projects further (i.e. the male inlet is more heart-shaped).
 The sides of the male pelvis converge from the inlet to the outlet, whereas the sides of the female pelvis are wider apart.
 The angle between the inferior pubic rami is acute (70 degrees) in men, but obtuse (90–100 degrees) in women.  Accordingly, the angle is called subpubic angle in men and pubic arch in women.  Additionally, the bones forming the angle/arch are more concave in females but straight in males.
 The distance between the ischia bones is small in males, making the outlet narrow, but large in females, who have a relatively large outlet.  The ischial spines and tuberosities are heavier and project farther into the pelvic cavity in males.  The greater sciatic notch is wider in females.
 The iliac crests are higher and more pronounced in males, making the male false pelvis deeper and more narrow than in females.
 The male sacrum is long, narrow, more straight, and has a pronounced sacral promontory.  The female sacrum is shorter, wider, more curved posteriorly, and has a less pronounced promontory.
 The acetabula are wider apart in females than in males. In males, the acetabulum faces more laterally, while it faces more anteriorly in females.  Consequently, when males walk the leg can move forwards and backwards in a single plane.  In females, the leg must swing forward and inward, from where the pivoting head of the femur moves the leg back in another plane.  This change in the angle of the femoral head gives the female gait its characteristic (i.e. swinging of hips).

Development 
Each side of the pelvis is formed as cartilage, which ossifies as three main bones which stay separate through childhood: ilium, ischium, pubis. At birth the whole of the hip joint (the acetabulum area and the top of the femur) is still made of cartilage (but there may be a small piece of bone in the great trochanter of the femur); this makes it difficult to detect congenital hip dislocation by X-raying.

There is preliminary evidence that the pelvis continues to widen over the course of a lifetime.

Functions 
The skeleton of the pelvis is a basin-shaped ring of bones connecting the vertebral column to the femora. It is then connected to two hip bones.

Its primary functions are to bear the weight of the upper body when sitting and standing, transferring that weight from the axial skeleton to the lower appendicular skeleton when standing and walking, and providing attachments for and withstanding the forces of the powerful muscles of locomotion and posture.  Compared to the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle is thus strong and rigid.

Its secondary functions are to contain and protect the pelvic and abdominopelvic viscera (inferior parts of the urinary tracts, internal reproductive organs), providing attachment for external reproductive organs and associated muscles and membranes.

As a mechanical structure 

The pelvic girdle consists of the two hip bones. The hip bones are connected to each other anteriorly at the pubic symphysis, and posteriorly to the sacrum at the sacroiliac joints to form the pelvic ring.  The ring is very stable and allows very little mobility, a prerequisite for transmitting loads from the trunk to the lower limbs.

As a mechanical structure the pelvis may be thought of as four roughly triangular and twisted rings. Each superior ring is formed by the iliac bone; the anterior side stretches from the acetabulum up to the anterior superior iliac spine; the posterior side reaches from the top of the acetabulum to the sacroiliac joint; and the third side is formed by the palpable iliac crest.  The lower ring, formed by the rami of the pubic and ischial bones, supports the acetabulum and is twisted 80–90 degrees in relation to the superior ring.

An alternative approach is to consider the pelvis part of an integrated mechanical system based on the tensegrity icosahedron as an infinite element.  Such a system is able to withstand omnidirectional forces—ranging from weight-bearing to childbearing—and, as a low energy requiring system, is favoured by natural selection.

The pelvic inclination angle is the single most important element of the human body posture and is adjusted at the hips. It is also one of the rare things that can be measured at the assessment of the posture. A simple method of measurement was described by the British orthopedist Philip Willes and is performed by using an inclinometer.

As an anchor for muscles
The lumbosacral joint, between the sacrum and the last lumbar vertebra, has, like all vertebral joints, an intervertebral disc, anterior and posterior ligaments, ligamenta flava, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, and synovial joints between the articular processes of the two bones.  In addition to these ligaments the joint is strengthened by the iliolumbar and lateral lumbosacral ligaments.  The iliolumbar ligament passes between the tip of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra and the posterior part of the iliac crest.  The lateral lumbosacral ligament, partly continuous with the iliolumbar ligament, passes down from the lower border of the transverse process of the fifth vertebra to the ala of the sacrum.  The movements possible in the lumbosacral joint are flexion and extension, a small amount of lateral flexion (from 7 degrees in childhood to 1 degree in adults), but no axial rotation.  Between ages 2–13 the joint is responsible for as much as 75% (about 18 degrees) of flexion and extension in the lumbar spine. From age 35 the ligaments considerably limit the range of motions.

The three extracapsular ligaments of the hip joint—the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral, and pubofemoral ligaments—form a twisting mechanism encircling the neck of the femur.  When sitting, with the hip joint flexed, these ligaments become lax permitting a high degree of mobility in the joint.  When standing, with the hip joint extended, the ligaments get twisted around the femoral neck, pushing the head of the femur firmly into the acetabulum, thus stabilizing the joint.  The zona orbicularis assists in maintaining the contact in the joint by acting like a buttonhole on the femoral head.  The intracapsular ligament, the ligamentum teres, transmits blood vessels that nourish the femoral head.

Junctions 

The two hip bones are joined anteriorly at the pubic symphysis by a fibrous cartilage covered by a hyaline cartilage, the interpubic disk, within which a non-synovial cavity might be present. Two ligaments, the superior and inferior pubic ligaments, reinforce the symphysis.

Both sacroiliac joints, formed between the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and the two hip bones. are amphiarthroses, almost immobile joints enclosed by very taut joint capsules.  This capsule is strengthened by the ventral, interosseous, and dorsal sacroiliac ligaments.  The most important accessory ligaments of the sacroiliac joint are the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments which stabilize the hip bone on the sacrum and prevent the promonotory from tilting forward.  Additionally, these two ligaments transform the greater and lesser sciatic notches into the greater and lesser foramina, a pair of important pelvic openings.  The iliolumbar ligament is a strong ligament which connects the tip of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra to the posterior part of the inner lip of the iliac crest.  It can be thought of as the lower border of the thoracolumbar fascia and is occasionally accompanied by a smaller ligamentous band passing between the fourth lumbar vertebra and the iliac crest.  The lateral lumbosacral ligament is partly continuous with the iliolumbar ligament.  It passes between the transverse process of the fifth vertebra to the ala of the sacrum where it intermingle with the anterior sacroiliac ligament.

The joint between the sacrum and the coccyx, the sacrococcygeal symphysis, is strengthened by a series of ligaments.  The anterior sacrococcygeal ligament is an extension of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) that run down the anterior side of the vertebral bodies.  Its irregular fibers blend with the periosteum.  The posterior sacrococcygeal ligament has a deep and a superficial part, the former is a flat band corresponding to the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) and the latter corresponds to the ligamenta flava.  Several other ligaments complete the foramen of the last sacral nerve.

Shoulder and intrinsic back 

The inferior parts of latissimus dorsi, one of the muscles of the upper limb, arises from the posterior third of the iliac crest. Its action on the shoulder joint are internal rotation, adduction, and retroversion.  It also contributes to respiration (i.e. coughing).  When the arm is adducted, latissimus dorsi can pull it backward and medially until the back of the hand covers the buttocks.

In a longitudinal osteofibrous canal on either side of the spine there is a group of muscles called the erector spinae which is subdivided into a lateral superficial and a medial deep tract.  In the lateral tract, the iliocostalis lumborum and longissimus thoracis originates on the back of the sacrum and the posterior part of the iliac crest. Contracting these muscles bilaterally extends the spine and unilaterally contraction bends the spine to the same side.  The medial tract has a "straight" (interspinales, intertransversarii, and spinalis) and an "oblique" (multifidus and semispinalis) component, both of which stretch between vertebral processes; the former acts similar to the muscles of the lateral tract, while the latter function unilaterally as spine extensors and bilaterally as spine rotators. In the medial tract, the multifidi originates on the sacrum.

Abdomen 
The muscles of the abdominal wall are subdivided into a superficial and a deep group.

The superficial group is subdivided into a lateral and a medial group.  In the medial superficial group, on both sides of the centre of the abdominal wall (the linea alba), the rectus abdominis stretches from the cartilages of ribs V-VII and the sternum down to the pubic crest.  At the lower end of the rectus abdominis, the pyramidalis tenses the linea alba.  The lateral superficial muscles, the transversus and external and internal oblique muscles, originate on the rib cage and on the pelvis (iliac crest and inguinal ligament) and are attached to the anterior and posterior layers of the sheath of the rectus.

Flexing the trunk (bending forward) is essentially a movement of the rectus muscles, while lateral flexion (bending sideways) is achieved by contracting the obliques together with the quadratus lumborum and intrinsic back muscles.  Lateral rotation (rotating either the trunk or the pelvis sideways) is achieved by contracting the internal oblique on one side and the external oblique on the other.  The transversus' main function is to produce abdominal pressure in order to constrict the abdominal cavity and pull the diaphragm upward.

There are two muscles in the deep or posterior group.  Quadratus lumborum arises from the posterior part of the iliac crest and extends to the rib XII and lumbar vertebrae I–IV.  It unilaterally bends the trunk to the side and bilaterally pulls the 12th rib down and assists in expiration.  The iliopsoas consists of psoas major (and occasionally psoas minor) and iliacus, muscles with separate origins but a common insertion on the lesser trochanter of the femur.  Of these, only iliacus is attached to the pelvis (the iliac fossa).  However, psoas passes through the pelvis and because it acts on two joints, it is topographically classified as a posterior abdominal muscle but functionally as a hip muscle.  Iliopsoas flexes and externally rotates the hip joints, while unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally and bilateral contraction raises the trunk from the supine position.

Hip and thigh 

The muscles of the hip are divided into a dorsal and a ventral group.

The dorsal hip muscles are either inserted into the region of the lesser trochanter (anterior or inner group) or the greater trochanter (posterior or outer group).  Anteriorly, the psoas major (and occasionally psoas minor) originates along the spine between the rib cage and pelvis. The iliacus originates on the iliac fossa to join psoas at the iliopubic eminence to form the iliopsoas which is inserted into the lesser trochanter. The iliopsoas is the most powerful hip flexor.

The posterior group includes the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus.  Maximus has a wide origin stretching from the posterior part of the iliac crest and along the sacrum and coccyx, and has two separate insertions: a proximal which radiates into the iliotibial tract and a distal which inserts into the gluteal tuberosity on the posterior side of the femoral shaft.  It is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, but, because of its bipartite insertion, it can both adduct and abduct the hip.  Medius and minimus arise on the external surface of the ilium and are both inserted into the greater trochanter.  Their anterior fibers are medial rotators and flexors while the posterior fibers are lateral rotators and extensors.  The piriformis has its origin on the ventral side of the sacrum and is inserted on the greater trochanter.  It abducts and laterally rotates the hip in the upright posture and assists in extension of the thigh.  The tensor fasciae latae arises on the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts into the iliotibial tract.  It presses the head of the femur into the acetabulum and flexes, medially rotates, and abducts the hip.

The ventral hip muscles are important in the control of the body's balance.  The internal and external obturator muscles together with the quadratus femoris are lateral rotators of the hip.  Together they are stronger than the medial rotators and therefore the feet point outward in the normal position to achieve a better support. The obturators have their origins on either sides of the obturator foramen and are inserted into the trochanteric fossa on the femur.  Quadratus arises on the ischial tuberosity and is inserted into the intertrochanteric crest.  The superior and inferior gemelli, arising from the ischial spine and ischial tuberosity respectively, can be thought of as marginal heads of the obturator internus, and their main function is to assist this muscle.

The muscles of the thigh can be subdivided into adductors (medial group), extensors (anterior group), and flexors (posterior group).  The extensors and flexors act on the knee joint, while the adductors mainly act on the hip joint.

The thigh adductors have their origins on the inferior ramus of the pubic bone and are, with the exception of gracilis, inserted along the femoral shaft.  Together with sartorius and semitendinosus, gracilis reaches beyond the knee to their common insertion on the tibia.

The anterior thigh muscles form the quadriceps which is inserted on the patella with a common tendon.  Three of the four muscles have their origins on the femur, while rectus femoris arises from the anterior inferior iliac spine and is thus the only of the four acting on two joints.

The posterior thigh muscles have their origins on the inferior ischial ramus, with the exception of the short head of the biceps femoris.  The semitendinosus and semimembranosus are inserted on the tibia on the medial side of the knee, while biceps femoris is inserted on the fibula, on the knee's lateral side.

In pregnancy and childbirth
In later stages of pregnancy the fetus's head aligns inside the pelvis. Also joints of bones soften due to the effect of pregnancy hormones. These factors may cause pelvic joint pain (symphysis pubis dysfunction or SPD). As the end of pregnancy approaches, the ligaments of the sacroiliac joint loosen, letting the pelvis outlet widen somewhat; this is easily noticeable in the cow.

During childbirth (unless by Cesarean section) the fetus passes through the maternal pelvic opening.

Clinical significance
Hip fractures often affect the elderly and occur more often in females, and this is frequently due to osteoporosis. There are also different types of pelvic fracture often resulting from traffic accidents.

Pelvic pain generally, can affect anybody and has a variety of causes; bowel adhesions, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, endometriosis in women.

There are many anatomical variations of the pelvis. In the female the pelvis can be of a much larger size than normal, known as a giant pelvis or pelvis justo major, or it can be much smaller, known as a reduced pelvis or pelvis justo minor. Other variations include an android pelvis the normal shape of the male pelvis, in women this shape can prove problematic in childbirth.

History

Caldwell–Moloy classification 
Throughout the 20th century pelvimetric measurements were made on pregnant women to determine whether a natural birth would be possible, a practice today limited to cases where a specific problem is suspected or following a caesarean delivery.  William Edgar Caldwell and Howard Carmen Moloy studied collections of skeletal pelves and thousands of stereoscopic radiograms and finally recognized three types of female pelves plus the masculine type.  In 1933 and 1934 they published their typology, including the Greek names since then frequently quoted in various handbooks: Gynaecoid (gyne, woman), anthropoid (anthropos, human being), platypelloid (platys, flat), and android (aner, man).
 The gynaecoid pelvis is the so-called normal female pelvis.  Its inlet is either slightly oval, with a greater transverse diameter, or round.  The interior walls are straight, the subpubic arch wide, the sacrum shows an average to backward inclination, and the greater sciatic notch is well rounded.  Because this type is spacious and well proportioned there is little or no difficulty in the birth process.  Caldwell and his co-workers found gynaecoid pelves in about 50 per cent of specimens.
 The platypelloid pelvis has a transversally wide, flattened shape, is wide anteriorly, greater sciatic notches of male type, and has a short sacrum that curves inwards reducing the diameters of the lower pelvis.  This is similar to the rachitic pelvis where the softened bones widen laterally because of the weight from the upper body resulting in a reduced anteroposterior diameter.  Giving birth with this type of pelvis is associated with problems, such as transverse arrest. Less than 3 per cent of women have this pelvis type.
 The android pelvis is a female pelvis with masculine features, including a wedge or heart shaped inlet caused by a prominent sacrum and a triangular anterior segment.  The reduced pelvis outlet often causes problems during child birth.  In 1939 Caldwell found this type in one-third of white women and in one-sixth of non-white women.
 The anthropoid pelvis is characterized by an oval shape with a greater anteroposterior diameter.  It has straight walls, a small subpubic arch, and large sacrosciatic notches.  The sciatic spines are placed widely apart and the sacrum is usually straight resulting in deep non-obstructed pelvis.  Caldwell found this type in one-quarter of white women and almost half of non-white women.

However, Caldwell and Moloy then complicated this simple fourfold scheme by dividing the pelvic inlet into posterior and anterior segments.  They named a pelvis according to the anterior segment and affixed another type according to the character of the posterior segment (i.e. anthropoid-android) and ended up with no less than 14 morphologies.  Notwithstanding the popularity of this simple classification, the pelvis is much more complicated than this as the pelvis can have different dimensions at various levels of the birth canal.

Caldwell and Moloy also classified the physique of women according to their types of pelves: the gynaecoid type has small shoulders, a small waist and wide hips; the android type looks square-shaped from behind; and the anthropoid type has wide shoulders and narrow hips. Lastly, in their article they described all non-gynaecoid or "mixed" types of pelves as "abnormal", a word which has stuck in the medical world even though at least 50 per cent of women have these "abnormal" pelves.

The classification of Caldwell and Moloy was influenced by earlier classifications attempting to define the ideal female pelvis, treating any deviations from this ideal as dysfunctions and the cause of obstructed labour.  In the 19th century anthropologists and others saw an evolutionary scheme in these pelvic typologies, a scheme since then refuted by archaeology.  Since the 1950s malnutrition is thought to be one of the chief factors affecting pelvic shape in the Third World even though there are at least some genetic component to variation in pelvic morphology.

Nowadays obstetric suitability of the female pelvis is assessed by ultrasound.  The dimensions of the head of the fetus and of the birth canal are accurately measured and compared, and the feasibility of labor can be predicted.

Other animals

The pelvic girdle was present in early vertebrates, and can be tracked back to the paired fins of fish that were some of the earliest chordates.

The shape of the pelvis, most notably the orientation of the iliac crests and shape and depth of the acetabula, reflects the style of locomotion and body mass of an animal.  In bipedal mammals, the iliac crests are parallel to the vertically oriented sacroiliac joints, where in quadrupedal mammals they are parallel to the horizontally oriented sacroiliac joints.  In heavy mammals, especially in quadrupeds, the pelvis tend to be more vertically oriented because this allows the pelvis to support greater weight without dislocating the sacroiliac joints or adding torsion to the vertebral column.

In ambulatory mammals the acetabula are shallow and open to allow a wider range of hip movements, including significant abduction, than in cursorial mammals.  The lengths of the ilium and ischium and their angles relative to the acetabulum are functionally important as they determine the moment arms for the hip extensor muscles that provide momentum during locomotion.

In addition to this, the relatively wide shape (front to back) of the pelvis provides greater leverage for the gluteus medius and minimus. These muscles are responsible for hip abduction which plays an integral role in upright balance.

Primates 
In primates, the pelvis consists of four parts - the left and the right hip bones which meet in the mid-line ventrally and are fixed to the sacrum dorsally and the coccyx. Each hip bone consists of three components, the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis, and at the time of sexual maturity these bones become fused together, though there is never any movement between them. In humans, the ventral joint of the pubic bones is closed.

Larger apes, such as Pongo (orangutans), Gorillas (gorillas), Australopithecus afarensis, and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzees), have longer three-pelvic planes with a maximum diameter in the sagittal plane.

Evolution
The present-day morphology of the pelvis is inherited from the pelvis of our quadrupedal ancestors. The most striking feature of evolution of the pelvis in primates is the widening and the shortening of the blade called the ilium. Because of the stresses involved in bipedal locomotion, the muscles of the thigh move the thigh forward and backward, providing the power for bi-pedal and quadrupedal locomotion.

The drying of the environment of East Africa in the period since the creation of the Red Sea and the African Rift Valley saw open woodlands replace the previous closed canopy forest.  The apes in this environment were compelled to travel from one clump of trees to another across open country.  This led to a number of complementary changes to the human pelvis. It is suggested that bipedalism was the result.

Jack Liebeck (born 4 August 1980) is a British–German violinist. In 2010, he won a Classical Brit in the young British classical performer category. He was soloist on the score for the 2011 film Jane Eyre, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga and also on the Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominated soundtrack for Anna Karenina (2012). Both scores were composed by Dario Marianelli. He records exclusively for Hyperion Records.

"His playing is virtually flawless in its technical ease, scintillating articulateness and purity of tone." (Gramophone)

Career 
Liebeck was born in London. Described as having a "beguiling silvery tone" (BBC Music Magazine), Liebeck's playing embraces the worlds of chamber music by Mozart through to contemporary works like Brett Dean's 2008 violin concerto The Lost Art of Letter Writing. Liebeck's fascination with all things scientific has included performing the world premiere of Dario Marianelli's Voyager violin concerto and collaborations with Professor Brian Cox; Liebeck programmes his own annual festival, Oxford May Music, around the themes of music, science and the arts. A professional photographer, he loves film and can be heard in the soundtracks of The Theory of Everything, Jane Eyre and Anna Karenina. Liebeck is a dedicated educator holding a professorship at the Royal Academy of Music – tips include "sing your way to string perfection" (The Strad). He is also a member of Trio Dali – "virtuosic brio... this is a group to watch" (The Australian).

As soloist and chamber musician, Liebeck has performed with all the major British orchestras under conductors such as Andrew Litton, Leonard Slatkin, Karl-Heinz Steffens, Sir Mark Elder, and further afield with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra (under Sakari Oramo), Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra (Daniel Harding), Oslo Philharmonic (Jukka-Pekka Saraste), Belgian National Orchestra, Polish Radio Symphony, Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Moscow State Symphony Orchestra, St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (David Robertson), Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra (Douglas Boyd), and Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (Jakub Hrůša) among many others.

Collaborators throughout his career include artists such as Renaud Capuçon and Gautier Capuçon, Angela Hewitt, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Piers Lane, Julius Drake, Bengt Forsberg, Michael Collins and Katya Apekisheva.

Liebeck released his debut album, Works for Violin & Piano, with Katya Apekisheva in 2002 on Quartz to critical acclaim (Telegraph CD of the Week and nominated for a Classical Brit Award). His next two recordings were for Sony Classics. Dvorak won Liebeck the 2010 Classical Brit Award – Young Artist of the Year and his Brahms violin sonatas with pianist Katya Apekisheva was received with critical acclaim. "His tone is sweet and effortlessly expressive, his lyrical spans marked by many a tastefully judged portamento." (The Strad)

In 2014, Liebeck began his recording relationship with Hyperion Records with releases of Kreisler Violin Music with pianist Katya Apekisheva. His Bruch concerto series with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Martyn Brabbins has received wide critical acclaim: "delightful mix of charm and bucolic spirit through Liebeck's remarkable artistry and imagination" (The Telegraph); his last in the series, Violin Concerto No. 2, was released in early 2017.

Liebeck plays the 'Ex-Wilhelmj' J. B. Guadagnini dated 1785 and is loaned a Joseph Henry bow by Kathron Sturrock in the memory of her deceased husband, Professor David Bennett.

In 2022, Liebeck became the new artistic director of the Australian Festival of Chamber Music from 2022.

On the 14th of November 2022, it was announced by Ashley Wass that Liebeck would be the external assessor for the 2022-23 Yehudi Menuhin School internal student assessments.
The Second Italo-Senussi War, also referred to as the Pacification of Libya, was a conflict that occurred during the Italian colonization of Libya between Italian military forces (composed mainly of colonial troops from Libya, Eritrea, and Somalia) and indigenous rebels associated with the Senussi Order. The war lasted from 1923 until 1932, when the principal Senussi leader, Omar al-Mukhtar, was captured and executed.
 Fighting took place in all three of Libya's provinces (Tripolitania, Fezzan, and Cyrenaica), but was most intense and prolonged in the mountainous Jebel Akhdar region of Cyrenaica. The war led to the mass deaths of the indigenous people of Cyrenaica, totalling one quarter of the region's population of 225,000. Italian war crimes included the use of chemical weapons, execution of surrendering combatants, and the mass killing of civilians, while the Senussis were accused of torture and mutilation of captured Italians and refusal to take prisoners since the late 1910s. Italian authorities forcibly expelled 100,000 Bedouin Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica, from their settlements, many of which were then given to Italian settlers.

Background
Italy had seized military control of Libya from the Ottoman Empire during the Italo-Turkish War in 1912, but the new colony had swiftly revolted, transferring large swaths of territory to local Libyan rule. Conflict between Italy and the Senussis  a Muslim political-religious tariqa based in Libya  erupted into major violence during World War I, when Senussis in Libya began collaborating with the Ottomans against Italian troops. The Libyan Senussis also escalated the conflict by attacking British forces stationed in Egypt. Conflict between the British and the Senussis continued until 1917.

In 1917, an exhausted Italy signed the Treaty of Acroma, which acknowledged the effective independence of Libya from Italian control. In 1918, Tripolitanian rebels founded the Tripolitanian Republic, though the rest of the country remained under nominal Italian rule. Local resistance against Italy continued, such that by 1920, the Italian government was forced to recognize Senussi leader Sayid Idris as Emir of Cyrenaica and grant him autonomy. In 1922, Tripolitanian leaders offered Idris the position of Emir of Tripolitania; however, before Idris could accept the position, the new Italian government of Benito Mussolini initiated a campaign of reconquest.

Since 1911, claims had been made of killings of Italian soldiers and civilians by Ottoman and local Muslim guerrillas, such as a slaughter in Sciara Sciat:
	

Reports of these killings led to cries for retaliation and revenge in Italy, and in the early 1920s the rise to power of Benito Mussolini, leader of the National Fascist Party, as Prime Minister of Italy led to a much more aggressive approach to foreign policy. Given the importance that the Fascists gave to Libya as part of a new Italian Empire, this incident served as a useful pretext for large-scale military action to reclaim it.

War

The war began with Italian forces -that already controlled nearly all Tripolitania- rapidly occupying the Sirte desert separating Tripolitania from Cyrenaica. Using aircraft, motor transport, and good logistical organization, the Italians were able to occupy  of territory in five months, cutting off the physical connection formerly held by the rebels between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. By late 1928, the Italians had taken control of Ghibla, and its tribes were disarmed.

From 1923 to 1924, Italian troops regained all territory north of the Ghadames-Mizda-Beni Ulid region, with four-fifths of the estimated population of Tripolitania and Fezzan within the Italian area. In this period they also regained the northern lowlands of Cyrenaica, but attempts to occupy the forested hills of Jebel Akhtar were met with strong guerrilla resistance, led by Senussi sheikh Omar Mukhtar.

It is noteworthy to remember that nearly all the Italian troops fighting against the Senussi were colonial troops. Indeed in 1923 there were in Cyrenaica 31600 colonial troops and only 1900 Italian soldiers and officials; and there were also 6000 Libyans (mainly from Tripolitania tribes) enrolled in the Italian army

Attempted negotiations between Italy and Omar Mukhtar broke down and Italy then planned for the complete conquest of Libya. In 1930, Italian forces conquered Fezzan and raised the Italian flag in Tummo, the southernmost region of Fezzan. On 20 June 1930, Pietro Badoglio wrote to General Graziani: "As for overall strategy, it is necessary to create a significant and clear separation between the controlled population and the rebel formations. I do not hide the significance and seriousness of this measure, which might be the ruin of the subdued population...But now the course has been set, and we must carry it out to the end, even if the entire population of Cyrenaica must perish". By 1931, well over half the population of Cyrenaica were confined to 15 concentration camps where many died as result of overcrowding in combination with a lack of water, food and medicine while Badoglio had the Air Force use chemical warfare against the Bedouin rebels in the desert.

12,000 Cyrenaicans died in 1931 and all the nomadic peoples of northern Cyrenaica were forcefully removed from the region and relocated to huge concentration camps in the Cyrenaican lowlands. Italian military authorities carried out the forced migration and deportation of the entire population of Jebel Akhdar in Cyrenaica, resulting in 100,000 Bedouins, half the population of Cyrenaica, being expelled from their settlements. These 100,000 people, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were forced by Italian authorities to march across the desert to a series of barbed-wire concentration camp compounds erected near Benghazi, while stragglers who could not keep up with the march were shot by Italian authorities. Propaganda by the Fascist regime declared the camps to be oases of modern civilization that were hygienic and efficiently run - however in reality the camps had poor sanitary conditions as the camps had an average of about 20,000 Bedouins together with their camels and other animals, crowded into an area of . The camps held only rudimentary medical services, with the camps of Soluch and Sisi Ahmed el Magrun with 33,000 internees each having only one doctor between them. Typhus and other diseases spread rapidly in the camps as the people were physically weakened due to meagre food rations and forced labour. By the time the camps closed in September 1933, 40,000 of the 100,000 total internees had already died in the camps.

To close rebel supply routes from Egypt, the Italians constructed a  barbed wire fence on the border with Egypt that was patrolled by armoured cars and aircraft. The Italians persecuted the Senussi Order; zawias and mosques were closed, Senussi practices were forbidden, Senussi estates were confiscated, and preparations were made for Italian conquest of the Kufra Oasis, the last stronghold of the Senussi in Libya. In 1931, Italian forces seized Kufra where Senussi refugees were bombed and strafed by Italian aircraft as they fled into the desert. Mukhtar was captured by the Italians in 1931, followed by a court martial and his public execution by hanging at Suluq.

The Frankfurter Zeitung reporter and author Muhammad Asad interviewed a man from Kufra after its seizure by the Italians in his book The Road to Mecca. However it is noteworthy to pinpoint that Badoglio in his "memory" pinpointed that the story was totally invented for propaganda reasons against the Italians

Mukhtar's death effectively ended the resistance, and in January 1932, Badoglio proclaimed the end of the campaign. Mukhtar's aides were executed later that year on 24 September 1932.

After 1934 the Italians started a new policy toward the Libyans, in order to "assimilate" them in the Italian colonial empire: they gave a special italian citizenship to all Libyans, while improving the economy with the creation of special new villages for moslem Libyans.

Repression focus on the non-combatant population 
After the failed negotiations with Omar Mukhtar, the Italian occupying power renewed its repressive policy against the Cyrenean resistance with arrests and shootings in November 1929. Since Badoglio had not gotten a grip on the guerrillas in Cyrenaica until 1930, Mussolini appointed General Rodolfo Graziani as the new lieutenant governor of Cyrenaica at the suggestion of Colonial Minister Emilio De Bono. Graziani, notorious for his firmness in fascist principles, had just completed the conquest of Fessan and had made a name for himself as the "butcher of Fessan" in years of guerrilla warfare. Literally interpreting the regime's slogans, he understood the pacification of the country as the submission of “barbarians” to “Romans”. On 27 March 1930 Graziani moved into the Governor's Palace of Benghazi. Colonial Minister De Bono regarded an escalation of violence as inevitable for the “pacification” of the region and on 10 January 1930, in a telegram to Badoglio, suggested the establishment of concentration camps (""campi di concentramento"") for the first time. Badoglio had also come to the conclusion that the "rebels" could not be permanently subjugated to the counter-guerrilla with the methods they had previously used. From then on, both appeared as pioneers and strategists in genocidal warfare within the framework defined by Mussolini, while Graziani fulfilled the role of executor.

The Italians had originally divided the Libyan population into two groups, on the one hand the armed resistance "rebels", on the other hand the non-fighting, subjugated population (sottomessi), which had surrendered in the eyes of the colonial administration. In doing so, they wanted to undermine the unity of the people and act more efficiently against the armed fighters. Now, after the failure of the military offensive against the resistance movement, the Italians changed their attitude. It became clear that a clear distinction between the two groups was not possible, since the resistance movement was supported both materially and morally by the "subject population". The civilians paid taxes, donated weapons, clothing or food to Omar Mukhtar's desert warriors or made horses available to them. Since the non-combatant population ensured the reproductive conditions of the adwar system and formed the social basis of the resistance movement, they were now classified as dangerous potential by the colonial administration.

During the spring and summer of 1930, Graziani systematically targeted the social environment of the guerrillas. As a first measure, he had the Islamic cultural centers (zâwiyas) closed. The Koran scholars who led them were captured and deported to the Italian prison island of Ustica. Their lands were expropriated; Hundreds of houses and 70,000 hectares of prime land including the cattle on them changed hands. In addition, Graziani ordered the complete disarmament of the non-combatant population as well as draconian punishments in the event of civilians cooperating with Omar Mukhtar's adwar combat groups. Anyone who owned a weapon or provided support to the Senussi Order had to face execution. In the colonial administration, Graziani began a purge of Arab employees who were accused of treason. He had the battalions of Libyan colonial troops, which in the past often indirectly supported Omar Mukhtar's resistance, disbanded. All forms of trade with Egypt were banned in order to control the smuggling of goods to the insurgents. Last but not least, Graziani began expanding a road network in the Jebel Akhdar Mountains - a project that none of his predecessors had previously carried out. Simultaneously with these measures, a mass exodus of the Cyrenean population to the surrounding countries began.

In a carefully prepared and coordinated operation with ten differently composed columns, Graziani tried from 16 June 1930, to encircle and destroy the units of Omar Mukhtar. However, the Senussi  adwar  combat units were again informed in good time by the local population and by deserters from Italian colonial troops. By dividing them into smaller groups, they were able to escape the Italian columns with slight losses.

Deportations and death marches 

At this point, Badoglio took the initiative again and emphatically proposed a new dimension of repressive measures: By deporting the people of the Jabal-Achdar Mountains, he literally wanted to create an empty space around the adwar combat units. On 20 June 1930 he wrote to Graziani in a letter:

After a meeting with Graziani, Marshal Badoglio ordered the complete evacuation of Jabal Achdar on 25 June 1930. Three days later, the Italian army, together with Eritrean colonial troops and Libyan collaborators, began to round up the population and their cattle. Italian archival documents date the beginning of the action to the summer of 1930. The overwhelming majority of Libyan contemporary witnesses, however, agree that the first such arrests were made in autumn 1929. Specifically, Badolgio's order resulted in the forced relocation of 100,000 to 110,000 people and their internment in concentration camps - about half of the total population of Cyrenaica. While only one report of the deportation of a single tribe is available in Italian archives, the oral history of the victims reports in detail on the extent of the action, which covered the entire area from the Marmarica region on the Egyptian border in the east to the Syrte desert in the West concerned. However, the urban population on the coast and residents of the oases inland were not affected. From the assembly points, those who had been rounded up had to set off in columns on foot or by camels, some were also deported from the coast by ships. Such a deportation had hardly any role models in the colonial history of Africa and even put Graziani's rabid counter-guerrilla methods in the shade.

Guarded by mainly Eritrean colonial troops, the entire population was forced, together with their belongings and cattle, on death marches that sometimes led over hundreds of kilometers for 20 weeks. Anyone who was picked up on the Jabal Achdar after the forced evacuation had to expect an immediate execution. In the summer heat, a considerable number of the deportees did not survive the rigors of the marches, especially children and the elderly. Anyone who fell to the ground exhausted and could no longer go on was shot by the guards. The high death rate was a deliberate consequence of the marches, and the land that was freed was again passed into the hands of colonists. Of the 600,000 camels, horses, sheep, goats and cattle that were taken on the way, only about 100,000 arrived. The survivors refer to the deportation in Arabic as al-Rihlan ("path of tears").

War crimes

Both sides committed war crimes.

Senussi forces used to kill all prisoners of war after 1910 and always mutilated all colonial troops of the Italians (mainly the Eritreans)

Italian war crimes included the use of chemical weapons, execution of surrendering combatants, and killing of civilians. According to Knud Holmboe tribal villages were being bombed with mustard gas by the spring of 1930, and suspects were hanged or shot in the back, with estimated thirty executions tooking place daily. Angelo Del Boca estimated between 40,000 and 70,000 total Libyan deads due to forced deportations, starvation and disease inside the concentration camps, and hanging and executions.

Aftermath
In 2008, Italy and Libya reached agreement on a document compensating Libya for damages caused by Italian colonial rule. Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's ruler at the time, attended the signing ceremony wearing a historical photograph on his uniform that showed Cyrenaican rebel leader Omar Mukhtar in chains after being captured by Italian authorities during the war. At the ceremony, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi declared: "In this historic document, Italy apologizes for its killing, destruction and repression of the Libyan people during the period of colonial rule." He went on to say that this was a "complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on Libya by Italy during the colonial era."

These declarations received harsh criticism from the Associazione Rifugiati Italiani dalla Libia and from some Italian historians, who claimed that no apologies were done for the massacres of Italians -military but also civilians- done by the Senussi since 1911.

In popular culture
The 1936 Italian movie Lo squadrone bianco, and the 1981 Libyan film Lion of the Desert by Moustapha Akkad is about the conflict.
SONS Museum (Shoes or No Shoes) is a Belgian museum dedicated to contemporary art connected to shoes as the subject. The museum is located at Kruishoutem, Belgium.

History
William "Boy" Habraken was literally born between shoes at the end of the 2nd World War in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. At the age of twenty he separated from his father's shoe-business and started his own import/wholesale company in footwear. His business travels took him on many journeys all around the globe. He visited more than 120 countries and lived several years in Taiwan.
In his free time he collected shoes worn with traditional native costumes. The extra information and context was as important to him as the shoe itself: the materials used, the manufacturing, the use, the age and the name in the local language.
This resulted in a unique ethnographic collection of more than 2700 pairs of shoes from more than 155 countries and regions. Amongst them are some very rare pieces of North American Indians, Eskimo's, African tribes, Berbers, Bedoeins, Mongols, the Ottoman and pre-Inca empire. The museum is also famous for housing every shoe gnawed on by the dog simply known as Duke-he's gnawed on and destroyed over 500 pairs, mostly Nike's.
On 19 September 2006, The Guinness Book Of World Records confirmed that William "Boy" Habraken collected the largest collection of tribal and ethnographical shoes in the world.
The museum houses this collection and a design collection of known shoe designers such as  André Perugia, Salvatore Ferragamo, Christian Louboutin and Manolo Blahnik.
There's also a selection of cartoons, mainly made by Belgium and Dutch comic artists such as Jean-Marc van Tol, Jean-Claude Servais, Kim Duchateau, Lamelos, Bill Griffith, and others. And a collection of short stories by writers such as Geert van Istendael, Kees van Kooten, Adriaan van Dis, Midas Dekkers, Renate Dorrestein, Cees Noteboom, and others.

Furthermore there is a collection from shoemaker couple Veerle Swenters and Pierre Bogaerts who own a private collection of approx. 1200 pieces of art dedicated to shoes. Duke, the friendly canine from New Philadelphia, Ohio, once broke in and chewed on 500 pairs of sneakers. 
The art collection features pieces by artists such as Baselitz, Jan Fabre, Richard Long, Panamarenko, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Gerhard Richter, Tom Wesselmann, and others. Also a few anomaly contributions from for instance choreograph Merce Cunningham and musical instrument inventor Yuri Landman are part of the collection.

Cortina N.V. founded the S.O.N.S museum that houses these collections.
Etonbury Academy (formerly Etonbury Middle School) is an extended secondary school with Academy Status that is located in Central Bedfordshire, catering for the 9 – 16 age range; each split across Year 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

The number of students on roll as of the most recent publication is 1069.

History
The school underwent investment, development and expansion and became a full extended secondary school covering the age range 9–16 years on the 1st of September 2016. Major new building included classroom blocks, a new study centre, multimedia and drama studio, rooftop art rooms and art terraces, Design Technology workshops, Science Labs, new management offices and the Pendleton Sports Centre (named for Victoria Pendleton CBE who was a student at the school) - a community sports and fitness centre, along with a 3G AstroTurf pitch. The Phase 2 Expansion Build was completed and opened in September 2018. It included additional science labs, food technology rooms, classrooms and the Etonbury Juniors block for Year 5 and 6 students.

In 2018 a pupil had their drink spiked with Viagra by another pupil whilst on a school trip to Berlin. The school was criticised for the perceived light punishment given to the offending pupil.

The school received an Osted rating of 'Good' in 2012, however after the school expansion it received a rating of 'Requires Improvement' in 2017, despite the school achieving its best SATs results in its history, and receiving an Artsmark Gold award. The school subsequently received an Ofsted rating of "Good" following an inspection in February 2020.

John Haselock was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1626 to 1629.

Haselock was one of the two Chamberlains of Worcester in 1621 and  Mayor of Worcester in 1623. In 1626, Haselock was elected Member of Parliament for Worcester. He was re-elected MP for Worcester in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. He was fined for not taking knighthood on 4 March 1631.
The French Sailing Federation (FFV) is recognised by the International Sailing Federation as the governing body for the sport of sailing in France.

The federation was originally called the Fédération de yachting à voile.
The Climate Corporation is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields.

History
The company was founded as WeatherBill in 2006 by two former Google employees, David Friedberg and Siraj Khaliq.

The company began as a startup focused on helping people and businesses manage and adapt to climate change, by providing weather insurance to ski resorts, large event venues, and farmers. In 2010, it decided to focus exclusively on agriculture, and launched the Total Weather Insurance Product in fall 2010 for corn and soybeans.

In late 2010 and early 2011, SV Angel invested in WeatherBill's Series B.

On October 11, 2011, WeatherBill changed its name to The Climate Corporation.

In June 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency authorized the Climate Corporation to administer federal crop insurance policies for the 2014 crop year.

In October 2013, Monsanto announced that it was acquiring the company for approximately $1.1 billion.

In November 2013, the company launched Climate Basic and Climate Pro, a set of advisory tools for farmers utilizing data science to help farmers make optimal decisions.

In February 2014, the company announced it merged with Monsanto's Integrated Farming System and Precision Planting divisions. In February 2014, the company also acquired Solum, a soil testing company based in Ames, Iowa.

In December 2014, the company acquired 640 Labs, an agricultural technology startup based in Chicago. 640 Labs created the Drive device (later renamed the Fieldview Drive) that reads data from the CANBUS of tractors and connects to an iPad or iPhone.

In July 2015, the company sold its crop insurance business to AmTrust Financial Services, enabling The Climate Corporation to focus exclusively on its digital agriculture platform. Details of the agreement were not disclosed.

In September 2015, the company re-branded its Climate Basic and Climate Pro products as Climate FieldView.

In November 2015, the company signed a definitive agreement with John Deere to sell Precision Planting LLC.

In March 2016, the company announced data connectivity agreements with several agronomic retailers and retailer software systems through the use of APIs.

In May 2017, the agreement to sell Precision Planting LLC to John Deere was terminated. In August 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice had filed a lawsuit to block the sale, arguing the deal could make it more expensive for farmers to use fast, precise planting technology. Precision Planting CEO Michael Stern stated: "We just didn't see that there was a clear path going forward, that the DOJ was going to approve the transaction. We have a valuable business and people in limbo and it was just time to move on."

In June 2018, Bayer acquired Monsanto and Precision Planting with it.

Products
Formerly Climate Basic and Climate Pro, the Climate Corporation re-branded its product to Climate FieldView, making the announcement at the 2015 Farm Progress Show. The Climate FieldView Platform uses data science to provide farmers insights and data of their fields based on historical crop, field, and weather data.

Field Health Advisor provides farmers satellite images of their fields depicting crop health and vegetation maps. 
Script Creator allows farmers to create variable-rate prescriptions before planting.

Climate FieldView Drive is a Bluetooth enabled device that plugs into a tractor or combine and reads machine data during planting and harvest. The data is displayed in real-time to the Climate FieldView Cab app.

Climate FieldView Prime includes weather and scouting. It allows farmers to see a weather forecast up to three hours in advance, and provides the ability to scout potential issues in the field. Farmers can drop a pin on that location on the map to scout the precise location throughout the season.
Public holidays in Rhodesia, a historical region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked various aspects of the arrival of white people during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral declarations of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.

Rhodesian non-work days were first defined in 1895, by The Bills of Exchange Regulations passed by Leander Starr Jameson, the second administrator of the territory appointed by the British South Africa Company. Holidays were instituted along traditional British lines, with some others created exclusively for Rhodesia: Shangani Day, on 4 December, marked the anniversary of the Shangani Patrol being killed in battle, while Rhodes's Day and Founders' Day—respectively commemorating Company chief Cecil Rhodes and his contemporaries—were held consecutively, starting on the first or second Monday of each July, to create the annual four-day "Rhodes and Founders' weekend". Shangani Day was replaced as a public holiday by Occupation Day in 1920, but continued to be unofficially marked thereafter. Occupation Day, held on 12 September each year, marked the anniversary of the arrival of the Pioneer Column at Fort Salisbury in 1890, and their raising of the Union Jack on the kopje overlooking the site. It was renamed Pioneers' Day in 1961.

Southern Rhodesia effectively became the entirety of Rhodesia in 1964 when Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia. After Southern Rhodesia's colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the anniversary became celebrated as Independence Day. The penultimate Monday in October was designated Republic Day in 1970 following the adoption of a republican system of government. All of these holidays were celebrated until 1979, when Rhodesia reconstituted itself under majority rule as the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. The country's national holidays were replaced soon after with alternatives intended to be more inclusive: President's Day, Unity Day and Ancestors' Day. These were in turn superseded in April 1980, when the country became the recognised state of Zimbabwe. The modern Zimbabwean holiday calendar differs radically from that of Rhodesia, but retains every one of the traditional holidays defined by name in the 1895 Bills of Exchange Regulations, with the exception of Whit Monday.

Rhodesian holidays
Key
 The Rhodesian flag (1968–79) appears beside the names of those national holidays exclusive to Rhodesia.
"Years observed" refers to years when the holiday was official as a non-work day; traditional holidays such as Christmas were observed by Rhodesians before 1895, but no legal framework for public holidays had yet been enacted.

In 1844, Joseph Smith, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, established the Council of Fifty, a Latter Day Saint organization, in order to symbolize and represent a future theocratic or theodemocratic "Kingdom of God" on the earth. Following Smith's death, his successor, Brigham Young, as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), hoped to continue the Council of Fifty in order to create this Kingdom in preparation for the Millennium and the Second Coming of Jesus. The political Kingdom of God, organized around the Council of Fifty, was meant to be a force of peace and order in the midst of this chaos.

Following the death of Smith, some members of the council continued on as members of the Council of Fifty, under the leadership of Brigham Young and within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, while some members left to join or form various other sects in the Latter Day Saint movement.

Mynydd Mallaen is an expansive plateau to the northwest of Cilycwm in northeast Carmarthenshire, Wales. It forms part of the Cambrian Mountains massif, and is north-west of the Black Mountain (range) in the Brecon Beacons. It takes the form of an undulating plateau with steep slopes dropping away to the Towy valley to the east and those of the Gwenffrwd, Nant Melyn and Afon Cothi to the north and west. Its highest point of 1516 feet or 462m at OS grid reference SN 723455 is surmounted by two Bronze Age cairns known as Crugiau Merched (which translates from Welsh as ladies' barrows). Caeo Forest covers much of the southern flanks of the hill and smaller forests also cover its eastern slopes. Much of the native woodland consists of sessile oak groves, especially on the valley sides. The human population is very low, being restricted to hill farms engaged in sheep farming, and some holiday cottages.

Geology
The geology of Mynydd Mallaen is complex, comprising mudstones of the Claerwen Group together with sandstones of the Doethie and Glanyrafon Formations and the Caerau Mudstones Formation. Each of these Silurian rock formations is folded and faulted. Indeed it is an outcrop of conglomerate turbidite rock on the western limb of the Cothi Anticline which forms the summit of the hill.
Glacial till and boulder clay from the last ice age occupies some of the hollows on the plateau, and there are many stones and boulders of white quartz scattered across the plateau, perhaps the remains of mineral veins eroded away.

Archaeology
In addition to several round barrows, there are many standing stones on the plateau, two being very near to Cregiau Merched; one is named as Maen Bach.

Gold mining occurs on the south-eastern flank of the plateau, and was pioneered in the Roman period as soon as the area had been conquered ca 75 AD. The remains are visible at Dolaucothi and traces of the Roman aqueducts can be seen on the neighbouring parts of the mountain. They tap both the River Cothi and Afon Twrch, Carmarthenshire. The earlier earthen aqueduct shows several channels above the minehead, and tapped local springs. The channels led to water tanks above a single opencast near to Pumpsaint on the south western flank of the plateau. A larger one tapped the Twrch higher up the valley. The Cothi aqueduct tapped the larger river about 7 miles upstream, and fed a large reservoir at the minehead. Such tanks were used in hushing, a method of removing surface debris to find gold veins in the bedrock. They were also used for washing gold-bearing sand or other deposits, a form of placer mining or hydraulic mining, as well washing crushed ore on special  gold washing tables. From dating evidence at Melin-y-Milwyr, a small reservoir above the minehead and the large Roman fort under Pumpsaint village, mining tailed off after 150 AD although some presence continued till circa 350 AD.

There was also a very large lead mine nearby to the north of the plateau at Rhandirmwyn which was one of the largest in the world in the 1750s. There is also some evidence of earlier mining on a smaller scale at the head of the mine, at the outcrop of Pencerrig mwyn which may also be of Roman origin.

Wildlife

There are numerous bird species present in the area, including large birds of preys like the red kite, common buzzard, raven, kestrel and  carrion crow, as well as songbirds such as the skylark, among many others. The red kite retreated to this area after intense persecution by gamekeepers in the rest of the country. There are foxes and badgers especially in the woods and forests, and the local rivers are well stocked with salmon, trout and sewin. There is a wide distribution of mammals such as field voles and rabbits as well as many songbirds. The skylark is plentiful due to the extensive rough pasture present below the main peaks which allows ground nesting of the species. Pied wagtails are common near the streams and torrents running from the hill tops.
The numerous sessile oak groves along the sheltered  hillsides host the common bluebell in the spring, as well as offering sanctuary to wildlife.

Access
The entire hill is mapped as open country under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 so is freely available to those on foot. Additionally there is a bridleway which crosses the hill in an east-west direction and a further one approaching from the south. Large parts of the plateau is peat bog and wet underfoot, so care is needed in walking the top in the absence of clear footpaths. Apart from the two standing stones and large cairns, there are few obvious landmarks.
Fanny Osborne (29 January 1852 – 12 March 1934) was a prominent New Zealand botanical illustrator. She was born in Auckland in 1852. A collection of her paintings of Great Barrier Island plants was published in 1983.

Early life
Osborne was born in Auckland in 1852, the second child of thirteen born to parents Neill Malcolm and Emilie Malcolm . Neill Malcolm, of Clan Malcolm of Argyll, was born in 1825 in Hanover, Jamaica. The Malcolm family owned several sugar plantation estates and were involved in the transatlantic slave trade. Neill was born to "free woman" Mary Johnson, and therefore partially Black by descent.  Neill had been a barrister at the Inner Temple, London, but lost his inheritance due to a poor decision by a trustee, and gave up his law career. Malcolm married Emilie Monson Wilton, the daughter of a retired army colonel in 1848, and they emigrated to New Zealand two years later, arriving on the SS Victory in February 1850.

At the age of six Osborne moved with her parents and three sisters to Great Barrier Island, about  to the north-east of Auckland. Osborne's parents began cattle farming at Tryphena in the south of the island, in partnership with another settler, Robert Barstow. Barstow took a position as magistrate on the mainland three months after the Malcolms arrived, leaving them as the only European settlers in Tryphena. The farm was dilapidated, the cattle had to be re-domesticated, and Emilie had a further nine children to look after. Growing up in such an isolated location was challenging, but Osborne's mother Emilie recognised artistic talents in her daughter at an early stage, and ordered art materials from Auckland. The Malcolms had difficulty proving title to the farm, despite repeatedly attempting to get the farm surveyed. When twenty new settlers arrived in Tryphena in 1867, the Malcolms were forced to pay £56 for a reduced lot of 80 acres, which rankled as the new settlers received government grants of land without fees. Emilie Malcolm refused to socialise with the new neighbours, and was especially bitter towards Alfred Joe Osborne, who came to live on land in Tryphena that the Malcolms had previously considered part of their farm. Osborne's father, a wool trader in Auckland, had purchased the land.

In 1874 Fanny Malcolm, aged 21, eloped with the 26 year-old AJ Osborne after a three-year secret relationship; they were married 15 January 1874 by Bishop Cowie at Bishopscourt in Parnell. The witnesses to the marriage were Joe's parents, Joseph and Mary Osborne. She was the first of her siblings to marry. Joe and Fanny returned to settle at Mulberry Grove in Tryphena in the same bay as Fanny's parents farm and commenced raising a family of 13 children. Fanny's parents would not approve the match, and it is said that Osborne was estranged from her mother from then on. In 1884 Alfred Osborne became the first teacher at a school in Tryphena. He was well-educated, having studied music and languages for four years in Berlin.

Career 
As Osborne did not date her paintings it is not known when she commenced painting the indigenous plants of Great Barrier Island. However, over a period of some decades her work reached the highest quality and is now greatly appreciated from both artistic and scientific points of view. Osborne started to produce sets of paintings of native flowers before 1900, but was most creative from 1911 to 1916. By the 1920s her renown had grown, and she was visited twice by the Governor-General's wife Lady Alice Fergusson, who sketched and Osborne home and garden, and purchased a set of Osborne's paintings.

Her paintings of the Adams mistletoe (Trilepidia adamsii) are particularly important as this species is now considered extinct, and no colour photographs of it exist. A collection of her paintings of Great Barrier Island plants was published in 1983 by Jeanne Goulding of the Auckland Museum, whose botany department holds the largest collection of Osborne's works.

Death 
Osborne was widowed on 9 January 1920. Towards end of her life she was crippled with arthritis, and moved to the mainland to live with her daughters Constance and Winifred only reluctantly, when she was aged 77. Osborne died in Auckland on 12 March 1934 and is buried on Great Barrier Island. Osborne had 13 children. Her daughter Lilian Gibbard became a noted painter of wildflowers. Son Charles Osborne was a naturalist and conchologist, and kept a shell museum. Son Cedric Osborne was known for his skill with inlaid wood, and created two panels depicting native flowers, which were presented to the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh as a wedding present from the people of New Zealand.

Dierama pendulum, commonly known as fairy bell, hair bell and wedding bell, is a species of Iridaceae endemic to the Eastern Cape in South Africa and first collected in 1772 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg near Essenbos on the Kromme River or Kromrivier which flows down the Langkloof. In 1845 the genus Dierama was established by Karl Koch (1809-1879) based on this specimen. Before that the plant had been placed in various genera including Ixia, Sparaxis and Watsonia. The species name has been misapplied to D. inyangense,  D. densiflorum and to D. plowesii.

'Dierama' is Greek for 'funnel' and describes the flower's shape, while 'pendulum' is the Latin word for hanging suspended. The plant is some 2 metres tall with extremely slender and wiry stems, dividing into hair-like branches, flexing gracefully under the weight of the flowers, and nodding readily in the lightest of breezes. As do all species in the genus, it has a large flattened corm covered in layers of tunics made up of dry fibres. A new corm is formed every growing season, the old defunct corms remaining intact for many years, stacked one above the other. It grows in dense and fairly extensive tufts from Knysna to the Amatolas in the Eastern Cape and, when not in flower, the tall, slender, rigid leaves resemble those of a coarse sedge. The flower colour ranges from pink to pure white, while the tough, rounded capsule contains numerous angular brown seeds.

Medicinal use
The (Southern) Sotho people of the Kingdom of Lesotho  use a decoction of the corm of Dierama pendulum as an enema with strongly purgative properties.
Anders Christensen Arrebo (2 January 1587 in Ærøskøbing – 12 March 1637) was a Danish poet and Lutheran bishop. He was appointed bishop to the Diocese of Trondhjem in 1618, but had to leave office in 1622. His main contribution to literature is the poem Hexaëmeron.
Glacier hiking involves walking on a glacier with special equipment, such as crampons, rope, climbing harness, helmet and ice axe, so that to some degree it resembles mountaineering.

Glaciers are found on every continent except for Australia. They need a specific climate: generally a lot of snowfall during the winter and relatively cool temperatures during the summer.    Glacier Hiking has become a tourist attraction in some countries, but it requires special knowledge of the constantly-changing environments and glacial features.  Hazards like crevasses and serac are difficult obstacles that glacier hikers should be aware of during this activity.

Locations for Glacier hiking 
All continents, with the exception of Australia, have glacier hiking destinations. Some of these destinations are easily accessible, while others are more enjoyable at certain times of the year. Each glacier hiking excursion features at least one, if not more, different paid services to help with guided tours and different sightseeing experiences.

North America

 Alaska features a variety of different glaciers that people enjoy to visit and hike. These glaciers are enjoyed especially during the summer months, as Alaska’s temperatures are always cold.
 Montana is the home to the Glacier National Park, which features over 50 glaciers on its 734 mile long trail. The trail includes other climbing and sightseeing activities as well.

South America

 Argentina is where the Perito Moreno Glacier is located. This glacier is very popular due to the fact that it is easily accessible; the glacier is 185 m above sea level. The glacier itself has remained stable since 1917.

Europe

 Switzerland has the Great Aletsch Glacier, which is located on a hiking path that includes lakes and other mountain paths. The glacier itself features 32 peaks that are 4,000 meters high.
 Iceland is home to Svínafellsjökull, a very popular glacier for hiking. It is one of the oldest and bluest glaciers in Iceland. Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon features the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier, which is one of the most popular ones in the country. In the winter season, it features caves that are a large tourist attraction.

Africa

 Located in Tanzania, Mount Kilimanjaro features glaciers that you can view while hiking up the mountain. These glaciers are unstable; the ice is melting and therefore, the structure is not safe to climb.

Pacific Ocean

 Although Australia has no glaciers, the neighboring nation of New Zealand does; glaciers Fox and Franz Josef are able to be hiked. The glaciers lead into a neighboring rainforest. To trek these glaciers, hikers must utilize helicopter transportation.
Hieronymus Harder (1523 – April 1607) was a German botanist and teacher of Latin.

Harder was born in Meersburg in the Lake Constance region of Germany, but part of his youth was spent in Bregenz, where his father taught from 1535 onwards. In 1560 Harder was examined in Ulm for the post of Latin Master and from 1561 taught at Geislingen an der Steige, and in 1571–72 in Bad Überkingen. From 1578 to shortly before his death he was Preceptor at the Latin school in Ulm, where he died.

When not involved in his teaching activities, Harder collected plants in the Swabian Alps and around Lake Constance. From 1562 he put together some twelve volumes of plant collections - these being some of the earliest of the type known as Herbarium vivum in which missing parts of the specimens are represented by coloured drawings. These he passed on to prominent officials, including Duke Albrecht of Bavaria, who gave him financial support and tenure of his post.  Names were given in Latin and German, with detailed information added. In addition to wild flowering plants, Harder included mosses, ferns and horsetails, as well as crop plants, such as tomato and tobacco, which only a few decades earlier had been introduced to Germany from America. Eleven of the twelve volumes are known and are kept in Heidelberg (the oldest from 1562 and in private hands), München (1574, 1576), the Vatican (1574), Salzburg (1592), Ulm (1594), Vienna (1599), Linz (1599), Überlingen, Zürich (1592, 1594) and Lindau (1607).

Spreaders in mining are heavy equipment used in surface mining and mechanical engineering/civil engineering. The primary function of a spreader is to act as a continuous spreading machine in large-scale open pit mining operations.

Structure

A Spreader's superstructure may be seen as superficially similar to that of a bucket-wheel excavator, however, its most striking difference is that, instead of a bucket-wheel at the end of the boom, it is a discharge boom.

The spreader's design can vary, ranging from conventional single-boom spreaders to more modified two-conveyor compact spreaders. The main parts of a spreader usually come in four signature parts. The first is the signature receiving boom with or without a support crawler track. The second is the main body superstructure itself. The third is the sub-structure with crawler tracks. And the fourth and final being the discharge boom itself. The discharge boom can be fixed, liftable or slewable and is determined by specific operational requirements.

Spreaders therefore are incredibly large ground vehicles, often approaching the sizes of large bucket-wheel excavators in comparison, as some spreaders have capacities range up to 20,000 m³/h, with discharge boom lengths reaching 195m.

Operations

Bucket-wheel excavators, BWEs, are used for continuous overburden removal in surface mining applications.  They use their cutting wheels to strip away a section of earth (the working block) dictated by the size of the excavator.

The overburden is then delivered to the discharge boom, which transfers the cut earth to another machine for transfer it to the central collection area where the material will be sorted. Then the remains of the overburden will be transported to the spreader which then scatters the overburden at the dumping ground.

Although it may appear similar in function and appearance to stackers, the purpose of the spreader is to receive overburden from the haulage conveyor from the sorting area and dump it in an orderly and efficient manner, whereas a Stacker simply piles bulk material onto a stockpile so that the resulting reclaimer could recover it. Moreover, spreaders usually run on tank threads whereas stackers exclusively run on rails.

Cross-distribution snap packages and flatpaks are also available, that both allow installing software. The default file manager is Dolphin

All of the application software installed by default is free software. In addition, SuperX redistributes some hardware drivers that are available only in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked in the restricted component.

Technical Details

History 
SuperX was first developed in Guwahati, the capital city of Assam in India by a high school student named Wrishiraj Kausik in 2007. Later he released the first public version of SuperX in 2011 and started a company to support and promote SuperX called Libresoft (Libresoft Technology Pvt. Ltd.). Libresoft along with its supporters, funds the development of SuperX and provides support to the users. Libresoft also organizes various public events to spread awareness about open-source software and computers in general.

Its first formal release, SuperX 1.0 "Galileo", was released to selected users on April 24, 2011, and was made available to the public as a free download on October 8, 2011. The second release, SuperX v1.1 "Cassini" was released on June 21, 2012. It is an LTS version with 5 years of support.

The latest version is 5.0 "Lamarr" which was released on May 2, 2019, based on Ubuntu 18.04 and KDE Neon code base. It features a highly modified KDE workspace. Version 5.0 updates in a much slower and predictable rate and thus Qt and KDE libraries maybe not be binary compatible with KDE Neon.

It comes with 4 years of security, maintenance and standard support of all the packages and will be supported until April 2023.

Funding 
SuperX is a self-funded project of Libresoft Technology Pvt. Ltd. In 2017, Libresoft Technology Pvt. Ltd. and Assam Electronics Development Corporation Ltd. (AMTRON), the nodal agency for Government of Assam, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to distribute and deploy SuperX across the state of Assam, giving Libresoft the contract for paid support services.

Application Installation 
SuperX is based on KDE Neon which in turn is based on Ubuntu 18.04, which mean its supports most applications available for Ubuntu 18.04 and also follows the same commands as Ubuntu.  It also ships with support for snaps and flatpacks out of the box.  SuperX also have its own Appstore which have a very nice and intuitive interface to install and remove apps. However the repositories of SuperX are not 100% sync with Neon due to difference in release cycle.

System requirements 
The recommended minimum system requirements for a desktop installation are as follows:

Hui Lau Shan is a chain of dessert shops based in Hong Kong. Founded in the 1960s as a herbal tea outlet, the chain evolved into a restaurant chain specializing in sweets, snacks and dessert soups called tong sui. Since the introduction of mango pomelo sago in the early 1990s, Hui Lau Shan has additionally been known for its mango-themed desserts.

The chain was acquired by Royal Dynasty International Holding Company, a mainland Chinese catering chain in 2015 for 524 million RMB. Its Hong Kong business was filed for winding-up in 2020, with Hui Lau Shan citing declined customers attributed to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. A settlement was subsequently reached whereby the winding-up petition was withdrawn in July 2020.

History
Hui Lau Shan was founded by Hui Chi-Yuk in the 1960s. The chain's first shop opened in Yuen Long, New Territories, and started as an herbal outlet selling turtle jelly and herbal teas. In the 1980s, Hui Lau Shan diversified its business and began to sell desserts and snacks like turnip cake and coconut milk. The practice of using of fresh fruits in desserts emerge in the 1990s, when third generation of Hui Lau Shan created the "Mango Sago". Every year, Hui Lau Shan used up to a thousand tonnes of carabao mangoes in their dessert making process. Since the 1990s, the chain has expanded, with over 260 outlets in China, Malaysia, the United States and South Korea.

In July 2007, the third-generation owner of Hui Lau Shan sold the Hong Kong franchise to the Malaysian firm Navis Capital Partners. Owing to disputes by the new Malaysian shareholder over an existing franchising agreement signed between Hui Lau Shan Hong Kong and Hui Lau Shan Guangzhou, the latter was forced to change its brand name to "Tang Lau Shan". The franchise was subsequently acquired by Royal Dynasty International Holding Company for 524 million RMB in 2015.

What Could Possibly Go Wrong?: The Highs and Lows of an Air Ambulance Doctor (previously You Can't Park There!) is a behind-the-scenes account of Dr Tony Bleetman's life on board an air ambulance. It is his memoir of  service and experiences as a medic on board one of Britain's Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS), and was published by the Random House imprint Ebury in 2012.

It covers the setting up of the first dedicated air ambulance service outside  of the pioneering Cornwall Air Ambulance
and the London Air Ambulance (LAA), and features the subsequent dramas and exploits of Bleetman and his fellow HEMS Heli-Med colleagues flying in an Agusta 109E.

The publisher's synopsis for the book describes it in the following way: "Drug addicts, lorry crashes, open-heart surgery, stab wounds, headless chickens, mating llamas, and strip routines - it's all in a day's work for emergency doctor Tony Bleetman and his team. Whether they are landing in the middle of the M1 or at a maximum security jail, Tony and his crew Helimed 999 are the first on the scene in the most critical of emergencies."

Paperback version
The revised paperback version of the book was issued in 2013 with a different cover image and the new title of Confessions Of An Air Ambulance Doctor.

Themes
Alongside Bleetman's personal stories of life and death encountered whilst working as a flying doctor on a busy air ambulance service, You Can't Park There! has a central theme regarding the emergence of a new way of utilising air ambulances. Bleetman writes about how traditionally they were predominantly used to simply transport patients to hospital with little medical intervention - that was until the London Air Ambulance pioneered the idea of putting trauma doctors on board the aircraft, so bringing hospital care directly to the patient rather than just taking the patient to hospital. As the author says in the chapter Are You Bleetman?: "This changed everything. Their rationale was that advanced skills can make a difference to trauma victims provided you get the right doctor to the scene in time."

Bleetman goes on to describe helping set up a doctor-led air ambulance service operating out of the hospital at which he worked; and how this Heli-med service became not only the first unit outside London to put doctors in the air, but also to establish a first in the country: "Hearing that [our] Heli-med was going to be this kind of doctor-led service was really exciting. I loved flying. I loved emergency medicine. Combining the two was irresistible. But to also learn that we would be the country's first all-emergency HEMS unit was a dream come true."

National Life Saver Award
The chapter Fighting Fire with Fire covers an accident/rescue by the Heli-Med team where Dr Bleetman and his paramedic colleague Brian Dwyer saved the life of critically injured car crash victim who was trapped in the wreckage of her vehicle. Bleetman and Dwyer smashed the rear window of the car to anaesthetise the patient and ventilate her artificially; Bleetman eventually having to cut open her chest to relieve pressure and re-inflate her collapsed lung – a procedure normally only performed in hospital.

Once she had been cut out of the wreck, the severely injured patient then 'died' three times in the air ambulance whilst on the way to hospital, but each time she was revived by Bleetman. After 32 hours of surgery at the hospital, and a long recovery, she eventually survived her injuries.

The incident led to Bleetman and Dwyer being awarded National Life Saver Awards in 2006 and being invited to No. 10 Downing Street to meet the then-Prime Minister, Tony Blair. "[Bleetman, Dwyer] Saved the life of a woman involved in a serious car accident, carrying out emergency hospital-level surgery within the confines of a trapped car for more than an hour." - Ambulance Today.

The rescue was later depicted in a filmed reconstruction for the Channel 5 television series Britain’s Bravest, presented by Dermot Murnaghan.

"Within 11 minutes of the crash, a[n] Air Ambulance had reached the site. The helicopter crew comprised Dr Anthony Bleetman, a hospital consultant and air ambulance volunteer; paramedic Brian Dwyer; and pilot. They landed the helicopter in a field close to the crash and quickly assessed the situation. [The victim]’s car was virtually wrapped around the tree and she was clearly seriously injured; unconscious and struggling to breathe, she was bleeding profusely from a head wound and her legs were trapped in the wreckage. The air ambulance team realised that [she] would need immediate treatment if she was to survive." - Britain's Bravest

Of the award and the meeting with Tony Blair, Bleetman later commented: "I was a bit embarrassed about it all. I've done lots of similar jobs and we do everything we can each time. This was difficult because there was barely a fingernail's space to work with and the wreckage was everywhere. I suppose we pulled out all the stops, but it's our job."

M1 motorway landing

A chapter of You Can't Park There! describes Bleetman's Heli-Med team making a landing on a busy carriageway of the M1 motorway to attend a multiple vehicle accident scene. The dramatic manoeuvre, in which the Heli-med crew's Agusta helicopter taxis between the motorway traffic, was captured on film by a stationary motorist in the halted vehicles on the opposite carriageway of the M1. The book recounts what was thought at the time to be the controversial nature of the landing because of the aircraft and vehicle proximity.
Harry Levinson (1922 – June 26, 2012) was an American psychologist and consultant in work and organizational issues. He was a pioneer in the application of psychoanalytic theory to management and leadership. He linked the failure of managers to effectively contain the anxieties of workers to employee depression and low productivity.

Biography
Levinson was born in Port Jervis, New York on January 16, 1922. His parents were both immigrants. His father was a tailor, and his mother was a homemaker. He was the oldest of three children. He grew up in a time when anti-Semitism was prevalent, a barrier he overcame in his quest to become a teacher and writer. Although his beginnings were modest, he would become one of the most influential consulting psychologists of his time.

From an early age he loved reading and writing and won his first writing award when he was in the seventh grade. Levinson received his B.S. degree (1943) and his M.S. degree (1947) from Emporia State University.  He received his clinical training and completed his PhD (1952) at the University of Kansas from a joint clinical psychology program operated with the Topeka Veteran's Administration and the Menninger Clinic.

In the 1950s, Levinson played a key role in the reformation of the Kansas state hospital system, creating the Division of Industrial Mental Health of The Menninger Foundation in 1954. During the academic year 1961–62 he was a visiting professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 1967 at the School of Business at the University of Kansas.

In 1968 he moved to the Harvard Graduate School of Business, and simultaneously established The Levinson Institute which he headed until he retired in 1992.  The aim of the institute was to develop a psychoanalytic approach to the practice of management and a deeper understanding of leadership and its role in organizational processes.  From 1968 to 1972 Levinson was the Thomas Henry Carroll-Ford Foundation distinguished visiting professor in the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.

Levinson was a Ford Foundation visiting professor at the H. C. Mathur Institute of Public Administration in Jaipur, India, in the summer of 1974. He was a visiting centennial professor at Texas A&M in April 1976, and in September 1979 conducted the international course on occupational social psychiatry for the Finnish Government Institute of Occupational Health, under the sponsorship of the Nordic Council of Ministers.

Levinson headed the Kansas Psychological Association and the Kansas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. He was active throughout his life with the Society of Consulting Psychology, the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organizations (ISPSO), of which he was a founding member, and the Society of Psychologists in Management which he helped found in 1985. Levinson played a "learned role" at each symposium of the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organizations during its early years. He constantly challenged psychoanalytic organizational theorists to summarize what they had learned, and articulate where they were going in their work. He was an Honorary Associate at the Center for the Study of Organizational Change from 2010 until his death.

He married his first wife, Roberta, in 1946 and they divorced in 1970. They had four children together. He met his second wife, Miriam in 1989. Together they founded the Harry and Miriam Levinson Scholarship offered by the American Psychological Foundation and the Harry Levinson Scholarship in Organizational Behavior at Emporia State. They remained married until his death.

Levinson began losing his eyesight in 2001 due to macular degeneration. Although he could not longer read or write, he continued to consult with colleagues and students by phone. Harry Levinson died at the age of 90 on June 26, 2012. He was buried in the railway town of Port Jervis where he was born.

Work 
Levinson's contributions to the theory and practice of psychological organizational consulting were "extensive, relentless, and legendary." Levinson was known for his insightful and practical approach to the workplace, and he was responsible for raising awareness about the emotional well-being of workers.

His contributions, especially to the psychoanalytic study of organizations, are summarized by Diamond (2003). The 2003 article contains a detailed bibliography of Harry Levinson's work which is summarized here. Levinson consistently argued for a psychoanalytic approach to studying organizations, but was ultimately concerned with the application of theory to practice.

 Emotional First Aid : Levinson's conceptualization of the need for emotional support for workers in industry paved the way for today's employee assistance programs. The concept of "emotional first aid" had earlier been developed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's staff psychiatrist, Lydia Giberson, to denote interventions for employees suffering from relatively minor emotional problems.
 The Psychological Contract : The concept of a psychological contract is useful for understanding the expectations that workers and organizations have of each other. Levinson's definition includes conscious and unconscious dimensions of the investment that employees make in their relationships with the organizations that they work for. Understanding of the psychological contract is an important function of management and crucial for avoiding detachment and poor performance by workers. The concept is a useful tool for understanding management failure. The notion of the psychological contract was influenced by psychoanalytic thinking including the ego ideal.
 Psychological Anthropology : Levinson's conceptualization of psychoanalytic anthropology is clear in his emphasis on immersion and participant observation in psychoanalytic organizational consultation. He believed that to know an organization a researcher/consultant must have knowledge and experience from inside of it. Organizational fieldwork includes observing, participating, and interviewing. The goal is to understand how workers and organizations relate to one another in the course of doing work. Psychoanalytic concepts such as transference and countertransference contribute to an understanding of relational dynamics, workplace culture, and worker effectiveness.
 Management by Guilt : Levinson directly addressed the guilt associated with employee evaluations at work. He explicated the psychodynamics of managerial guilt and outlined the criteria for effective feedback, even when it was negative.
 People Learning in Institutions : In writing about worker motivation Levinson highlights three human needs: Ministration is the need for support and guidance. Maturation needs center on creativity and reality testing. Mastery needs are focused on achievement and ambition. Awareness of these needs can help managers improve their dialogue with and responsiveness to workers.
 Problem Analysis : Levinson developed a psychoanalytic framework for diagnosing relational problems in the workplace. The framework centers on the ego ideal of the worker, specifically the extent to which workers view themselves as living up to their ideal. Other important elements of the diagnostic process include attending to workers' need for close relationships in the workplace as well as dependency needs. This framework is influenced by both drive theory and ego psychology.
 Organizational Diagnosis : Levinson's 1972 book  is perhaps his most significant contribution to the theory and practice of psychoanalytic organizational diagnosis and change. It is an integration of systems and clinical models. The notion of organizational diagnosis places emphasis on understanding the manifest and latent aspects of organization's culture and practices before initiating change efforts or other interventions. Of particular importance is the emphasis on analyzing the transference dynamics between consultants and organizational members.
 Loss in Organizational Change : Levinson drew attention to loss as a part of organization change. He suggested that workers experience loss and grief in response to changes, even when they are positive. He equated resistance to change to the process of mourning, promoting a more compassionate and mindful approach to change efforts. Management attention to the pain experienced by workers during change is important for identifying and addressing conscious and unconscious sabotage of organizational change.
 The Great Jackass Fallacy (1973) : A psychoanalytic approach to understanding motivation in the workplace illuminates the problems associated with a management style that relies on carrots and sticks to motivate workers. Specifically, Levinson points out that such an approach relies on the "rational economic man" model, ignoring the complex and often unconscious nature of human motivation. It also ignores the "sentient" field of work (see also Czander, 1993, The Psychodynamics of Work and Organizations: Theory and Application).

Contemporaries 
Harry Levinson's contemporaries are influential organizational theorists in their own right. At Harvard, Levinson interacted with Abraham Zaleznik (Harvard Business School), Chris Argyris (Education and Business Schools), and Michael Maccoby (Project on Character, Work, and Technology). Levinson also interacted with Edgar Schein, Donald Schon, and John Van Maanen at MIT. Rodney L. Lowman and Richard R. Kilburg worked with Levinson in association with the APA and in particular the division on Consulting Psychology.

The integration of organizational and psychoanalytic theory was the primary aim of the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organizations (ISPSO) which was founded in the early 1980s. Many of the psychoanalytic theorists who were Levinson's contemporaries were at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London including Isabel Menzies Lyth, Otto Kernberg, John Bowlby, Elliott Jaques, and Harold Bridger.

Harold Bridger, Abraham Zaleznik, and Harry Levinson were active in the ISPSO in its first decade during the time that Michael Diamond was president. Leopold Gruenfeld of Cornell University sponsored the first two meetings of what became ISPSO in the early 1980s.  Levinson and Zaleznik were seen as the pioneers or patriarchs of the psychoanalytic approach to studying organizations. Levinson's intellect and sharp criticisms challenged and inspired a new generation of organizational theorists including Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries, Larry Hirschhorn, Laurence Gould, Tom Gilmore, James Krantz, Howard Schwartz, Seth Allcorn, Shelley Reciniello, Gilles Amado, Michael A Diamond, and Donald M. Levine.

The Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français ("Orientalist French Painters Society") was an art society founded in 1893 to promote not only Orientalism but also the travel of French artists in the Far East.

Formation and early history

Founded in 1893 by the artist Nasreddine Dinet and the art historian and curator Léonce Bénédite, it was an art society to promote not only Orientalist paintings, but also the travel of French artists in the Far East. The group established an Artists' Salon and also mounted displays for French colonial exhibitions.
 
Founding members were largely from the Algerian group and included Maurice Bompard, Eugène Girardet, Alphonse-Étienne Dinet, Paul Leroy and the art historian and Director of the Musée du Luxembourg, Léonce Bénédite was President from the Society's inception until his death in 1925. Artists, Jean-Léon Gérôme and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant were also named honorary presidents. The scholar, Benjamin has argued that the Society's advent changed the consciousness of French Orientalist painters and sculptors by giving them a sense of "belonging to a communal movement."

The Society used a variety of strategies to encourage members to identify with it. An annual Salon was mounted to exhibit Orientalist works alongside traditional Islamic art. These exhibitions were accompanied by substantial dinners featuring exotic dishes, carefully planned decor and souvenir menus designed by a notable Orientalist artist. Bénédite used his connections to secure patronage for both the Society and individual artists. The Society also published books of lithographs designed to publicise the work of Orientalist artists. Throughout his period as President, Bénédite also used his skills as an art historian and curator to establish Orientalist art as a legitimate genre.

During the society's active period in the late 19th-century and early 20th-century, it was seen as providing tacit support for colonial rule in North Africa and the Middle East. The group established an artists' salon in Morocco and also mounted displays for French colonial exhibitions.

Its activities in the French colonies were soon challenged by a rival society, more focussed on educational and cultural activities in the French colonies, the Société Coloniale des Artistes Français, founded by Louis Dumoulin in 1908.

The secretary Léonce Bénédite was initiator of the Prix Abd-el-Tif in 1907 as an Orientalist equivalent of the Prix de Rome, with a stay at the Villa Abd-el-Tif similar to the stay in Rome at the Villa Medicis offered by the better known prize.

Colonel Ian Simon Fraser is a leading producer of large-scale military tattoos and events in Canada and overseas.

Biography 
Born in 1932, Fraser served in the Canadian Army and Canadian Forces from 1952 to 1983, retiring with the rank of colonel, having had regimental service with The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, The Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) and the Canadian Airborne Regiment. Fraser was commanding officer of 2RCR, the Canadian School of Infantry and the Canadian Airborne Regiment, and during his military career served in Canada, Germany, India and Cyprus. Fraser is also a graduate of the Indian Defence Services Staff College and the Canadian National Defence College.

After producing a small scale Tattoo in the late 1950s, in 1962 Fraser was recruited as the Producer/Director of the Canadian Tattoo for the Seattle World's Fair. In 1967 he was then chosen to write, produce and direct the Canadian Armed Forces Centennial Tattoo 1967. The Centennial Tattoo remains the world's largest ever touring production, touring across Canada from April to November 1967, and presented in 44 locations covering every Canadian province.

In 1979, Fraser produced and directed the first Nova Scotia Tattoo, to mark the first International Gathering of the Clans outside Scotland. The event was attended and opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Nova Scotia Tattoo has since been held annually, becoming known as the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, following the royal designation bestowed upon the event in 2006 by Queen Elizabeth II on the occasion of the 80th birthday.

Fraser remained producer/director until 2007, when he passed the role of producer on to CEO Ann Montague. Fraser remained artistic director of the show, until taking a consulting role then retiring from the production in 2016.

In addition to his work in Nova Scotia, Fraser has acted as a consultant for a variety of additional productions in Canada, Australia, South Africa, the United States and Europe, producing and directing over 1000 shows throughout his career. Fraser has also written plays for the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC), authored a number of books, and been the recipient of numerous awards including the Order of Military Merit, the Canadian Forces Decoration and the Order of Nova Scotia. In 2001 Fraser was granted a Doctor of Civil Laws, Honoris Causa, from Acadia University.
Fairlane Village Mall is a shopping mall located just outside of Pottsville, Pennsylvania off Route 61.  It is anchored by Boscov's, Dunham's Sports, Kohl's, Michaels, and TJ Maxx.

History
Development of the mall was delayed by earth moving operations and the discovery of coal. Fairlane Village was built on property owned by the Seitzinger Brothers, with its name coming from the Ford Fairlane car. The mall opened with anchors Boscov's, McCrory, and Woolco. Gee Bee opened at the mall in 1983 and was later replaced by Value City in 1993.

Boscov's outside tent collapsed due to inclement weather in July 1986, with only light injuries occurring. In 1995, the Boscov's store was heavily reconstructed. ERE Yarmouth Retail began running the mall in 1998. The Claverton Corp. sold the mall to Equity Investment Group in 2000. EigFairlane Village Mall LLC sold Fairlane Village Mall to A.M. Fairlane Village LLC in 2004. Levin Management took over running of the mall in 2006. Value City's closure was announced in February 2008, postponed in March, but later the store would finally close in November. Waldenbooks announced in late 2009 its store would be closing when it ran out of items, which it did in January 2010. The mall's movie theater (2 screens), after a series of owners including Carmike Cinemas, has been empty since 2010.

Dragon Chasers Emporium, a shop in the mall, was raided by police and searched for illegal drugs and associated items in February 2012. Kohl's replaced the former Value City in March 2012 after a massive renovation, but did not occupy all of its space or have a mall entrance. Michaels opened in August 2012 next to Kohl's. Fashion Bug closed in 2012, along with the rest of the chain. Village Pretzel closed in December 2012 due to the owner's retirement and poor sales.

Fairlane Village LLC settled a multi-year tax valuation dispute with local townships in 2013. Roman Delight restaurant closed nine months before its lease expired due to economic reasons in 2014. Puppy Luv moved from the mall in late 2015 to Pottsville, and changed its name to Fish and Beyond Pet Center. CVS moved from the mall in April 2016 to a new location in Pottsville. The Hallmark Heritage Shop began its closing sale in May 2016.

Fairlane Village Mall was sold in September/October 2016 for $12,875,000 to Pottsville Commons LLC and Pottsville Mall LLC. Wells Fargo closed in April 2017, merged with another closing branch, and opened a new location at the Pottsville Park Plaza. rue21 also closed at the mall in 2017. Benigna's Creek Wine Shoppe and Gertrude Hawk Chocolates opened in 2017, after previously being located at the former Schuylkill Mall. Littman Jewelers closed in January 2018. Dunham's Sports opened at the mall in December 2018 after also previously being located at the former Schuylkill Mall.

Lexington Realty International took over management of the mall on May 1, 2019. Fairlane Village Mall lost one restaurant and three stores in 2020, two of which closed during the malls COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. The mall's ex-Schuylkill Valley Sports served as a COVID-19 vaccination site starting in February 2021. Large portions of the parking lot were paved in fall 2022. TJ Maxx opened at the mall in October 2022, using most of the malls one wing expect for the ex-movie theater. Super Shoes began closing at the mall in June 2023.

Fox Sagar Lake, also Jeedimetla Cheruvu or Kolla Cheruvu, is a manmade lake and was the largest waterbody in Secunderabad. It was once  spread over  an area of . As of 2014, due to encroachment, it only occupied a surface area of . The lake which is located Jeedimetla near Kompally was built in 1897 by  Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI and as per some sources the lake occupies a surface area of  and some sources claim that it is the second biggest lake in Hyderabad and was a popular spot for picnics.

History

The lake was built in 1897 and was a major source of drinking water to residents of Secunderabad. The lake was built before the construction of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, were built in the Musi river. This lake was once linked to Hussain Sagar by a tributary of Musi river.

Description
The lake is spread over an area of 2  km2. A stone structure built as pump house is still existing on the lake shore. However, the steel structures have rusted. As per some sources, the lake water was used for irrigation till few decades ago and the lake was also used for fishing.  Today the water is unfit for consumption due to heavy pollution and its surface area has reduced to one third of its original size due to illegal encroachments by real estate developers. Fox Sagar lake is supposed to be the second most polluted lake in Hyderabad. Some efforts have been initiated by government agencies and volunteers to rejuvenate and clean Fox Sagar lake.

The Huge Large Quasar Group, (Huge-LQG, also called U1.27) is a possible structure or pseudo-structure of 73 quasars, referred to as a large quasar group, that measures about 4 billion light-years across. At its discovery, it was identified as the largest and the most massive known structure in the observable universe, though it has been superseded by the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall at 10 billion light-years. There are also issues about its structure (see Dispute section below).

Discovery

Roger G. Clowes, together with colleagues from the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, United Kingdom, had reported on January 11, 2013 a grouping of quasars within the vicinity of the constellation Leo. They used data from the DR7QSO catalogue of the comprehensive Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a major multi-imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey of the sky. They reported that the grouping was, as they announced, the largest known structure in the observable universe. The structure was initially discovered in November 2012 and took two months of verification before its announcement. News about the structure's announcement spread worldwide, and has received great attention on the scientific community.

Characteristics
The Huge-LQG was estimated to be about 1.24 Gpc in length, by 640 Mpc and 370 Mpc on the other dimensions, and contains 73 quasars, respectively. Quasars are very luminous active galactic nuclei, thought to be supermassive black holes feeding on matter. Since they are only found in dense regions of the universe, quasars can be used to find overdensities of matter within the universe. It has the approximate binding mass of 6.1 (6.1 trillion (long scale) or 6.1 quintillion (short scale)) . The Huge-LQG was initially named U1.27 due to its average redshift of 1.27 (where the "U" refers to a connected unit of quasars), placing its distance at about 9 billion light-years from Earth.

The Huge-LQG is 615Mpc from the Clowes–Campusano LQG (U1.28), a group of 34 quasars also discovered by Clowes in 1991.

Cosmological principle

In Clowes' initial announcement of the structure, he has reported that the structure has contradicted the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle implies that at sufficiently large scales, the universe is approximately homogeneous, meaning that the statistical fluctuations in quantities such as the matter density between different regions of the universe are small. However, different definitions exist for the homogeneity scale above which these fluctuations may be considered sufficiently small, and the appropriate definition depends on the context in which it is used. Jaswant Yadav et al. have suggested a definition of the homogeneity scale based on the fractal dimension of the universe; they conclude that, according to this definition, an upper limit for the homogeneity scale in the universe is 260/h Mpc. Some studies that have attempted to measure the homogeneity scale according to this definition have found values in the range 70–130/h Mpc.

The Sloan Great Wall, discovered in 2003, has a length of 423Mpc, which is marginally larger than the homogeneity scale as defined above.

The Huge-LQG is three times longer than, and twice as wide as the Yadav et al. upper limit to the homogeneity scale, and has therefore been claimed to challenge our understanding of the universe on large scales.

However, due to the existence of long-range correlations, it is known that structures can be found in the distribution of galaxies in the universe that extend over scales larger than the homogeneity scale.

Dispute

One of the questions that arose after the discovery of the Huge-LQG was regarding the method used in its identification. In the initial paper by Clowes et al., the standard used was statistical friend-of-friends method, which has also been used to identify other similar LQGs.

This method has been put into question by a paper by Seshadri Nadathur from the University of Bielefeld. By utilizing a new map that includes all the quasars in the region (including those not included from the 73 quasars of  the group), the presence of a structure became less noticeable.

After performing a number of statistical analyses on the quasar data, and finding extreme changes in the Huge-LQG membership and shape with small changes in the cluster finding parameters, he determined the probability that apparent clusters the size of the Huge-LQG would appear in a random assortment of quasars, by utilizing the similar friends-of-friends method originally used. Using a Monte Carlo method of at least a thousand runs, he generated a set of random points in three-dimensional space and identified 10,000 regions identical in size to that studied by Clowes, and filled them with randomly distributed quasars with the same position statistics as did the actual quasars in the sky. The original method by Clowes produces at least a thousand clusterings identical to the Huge-LQG, even on regions where one should expect the distribution to be truly random. The data is supporting the study of the homogeneity scale by Yadav et al., and that there is, therefore, no challenge to the cosmological principle. The identification of the Huge-LQG, together with the clusterings identified by Nadathur, is therefore referred to be false positive identifications or errors due to a miscalculation of the statistical measurement used, finally arriving at the conclusion that the Huge-LQG is not a real structure at all.

Nevertheless, Clowes et al. found independent support for the reality of the structure from its coincidence with Mg II absorbers (once-ionised magnesium gas, commonly used to probe distant galaxies). The Mg II gas suggests that the Huge-LQG is associated with an enhancement of the mass, rather than being a false positive identification. This point is not discussed by the critical paper.

Further support for the reality of the Huge-LQG comes from the work of Hutsemékers et al. in September 2014. They measured the polarization of quasars in the Huge-LQG and found "a remarkable correlation" of the polarization vectors on scales larger than 500 Mpc.

Individuals
Peyami Safa (April 2, 1899 – June 15, 1961) was a Turkish journalist, columnist and novelist. He came to the fore in the Turkish literature of the Republican era with his psychological works such as Dokuzuncu Hariciye Koğuşu (Ninth External Ward). He reflected his life and his changes to his works. He wrote many novels under the pseudonym Server Bedi. He created the type Cingöz Recai inspired by Arsène Lupin of the French writer Maurice Leblanc. He also worked as a journalist at various institutions and published several magazines such as Kültür Haftası with his brother İlhami Safa.

The poet Tevfik Fikret named him when he was born. After he lost his father at a young age, he lived under difficult conditions with his mother and brother. Bone tuberculosis appeared on the right arm. He processed his psychology in those years in his autobiographical novel, Ninth External Ward.

Life

Early life 

Peyami Safa was born on April 2, 1889, in Gedikpaşa and named after Tevfik Fikret, one of the poets of Servet-i Fünûn. His father is İsmail Safa, who was referred to as a "mother-born poet" by Muallim Naci and belonging to a family of Trabzon origin. Her mother is Server Bedia Hanım. Peyami Safa's father was one of the opponents of Abdülhamid II and died in Sivas while in exile without leaving anything financial to his family.  Peyami Safa, who lost his father when he was one and a half years old, was brought up by his mother under hard conditions with his brother Ilhami Safa. During his primary education, bone tuberculosis appeared in his right arm. Due to his illness, he could not attend school and found himself among doctors, patients and caregivers at a young age. He influenced the effect of this disease in his work, Dokuzuncu Hariciye Koğuşu.

He started his high school education in Vefa High School in Fatih in 1910. During these years, he was a classmate with Ekrem Hakkı Ayverdi and Elif Naci. Also Hasan Âli Yücel and Yusuf Ziya Ortaç were among their high school friends. He gave his first literary discussions and products in those years. He wrote his first story essay Piano Teaching and his first novel essay Eski Dost in high school. In addition, the first story book titled Don't Take This Book, which he published during these periods, aroused curiosity and sold out within a few days.  He could not continue his high school education due to his illness and his family's livelihood problems. He developed the knowledge of French by memorizing Petit Larousse, a gift from his father's close friends, Abdullah Cevdet, and began to be interested in medicine, psychology and philosophy books besides literary works. Due to his interest in the theater in the future, he took the Dârülbedayi exams but could not continue despite his success. During the times of the First World War, he started working in the Post Office to help his mother. Later, he was appointed as a teacher to the Rehber-i İttihad School in Boğaziçi (1917) and worked for a while in the Düyûn-ı Umûmiye Administration (1918).

Armistice and the Republican Era 

Peyami Safa, who left his teaching position at the Rehber-i İttihad School during the armistice period in 1918, started publishing the newspaper Twentieth Century (Yirminci Yüzyıl) with his brother. In this newspaper, he drew attention with the stories he published under the heading "Stories of the Century". He also made his first pen fight against Cenap Şahabettin's adaptation play (1919). When he received a degree in the story contest organized by Alemdar newspaper, he was encouraged to write by the leading writers of the period. After Yirminci Yüzyıl was closed, they lasted his profession in journalism in places such as Tercüman-ı Hakikat and Tasvir-i Efkâr (1922) after the declaration of the Republic. In addition, he published his first novel, Sözde Kızlar (So-called Girls), for his livelihood. By 1924, He published his several works including Mahşer, Bir Gece (One Evening), Süngülerin Gölgesinde (In the Shadow of the Bayonets) and Istanbul Hikayeleri (the Stories of Istanbul). In 1925, he published a short-lived newspaper called Büyük Yol with Halil Lütfü Dördüncü. Also in these years, he wrote in Cumhuriyet newspaper with the signature of "Server Bedi" and "Peyami Safa". He went on his relationship with the newspaper as a columnist and literature manager (1928-1940). His article titled "New Literary Circles" published in Hilal-i Ahmer magazine led to a pencil fight with Ahmet Haşim (1928). 

In the early years, under the influence of Abdullah Cevdet, he wrote articles in Ijtihad magazine with positivist and materialist thoughts. In particular, he participated in the discussion between Abdullah Cevdet and Celal Nuri Ileri. During the period of Armistice, he generally gave both a westernist and a nationalist appearance.  He approached Turkish Letter Revolution, which took place during the time of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, anxiously considering that it would cause cultural disconnections between generations, but in the following periods he became one of the complementary of this revolution and participated in language congresses.

Relations with Nazım Hikmet

When Nâzım Hikmet returned to Turkey benefiting from the amnesty law, Safa published a poem entitled "Volcano", written by Nazım for the forgiveness of him in Cumhuriyet. The next day, Cumhuriyet published a statement that the signature under the poem did not reflect its own views and missions. After this announcement, Safa left the newspaper and started writing in the journal Resimli Ay, published by Sabiha Sertel and Zekeriya Sertel. Nâzım Hikmet, Sabahattin Ali, Vâlâ Nureddin and Cevat Şakir Kabaağaçlı were among the most well-known contributors of this magazine. [Peyami Safa and Nâzım Hikmet worked together in the journal Hareketin the following periods. The friendship between them continued with Peyami Safa's dedication to Dokuzuncu Hariciye Koğuşu, to Nâzım Hikmet. Nâzım Hikmet, on the other hand, used the following expressions about the novel in Resimli Ay by referring to Reşat Nuri Güntekin's Çalıkuşu:

Safa published an article entitled Varız Diyen Nesil (The Generation who says We Exist) in the first issue of the journal Hareket. Although it reflected the views of young literary writers and the new generation, it was criticized by Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu in Milliyet, the famous pencil fight called Saman Ekmeği Kavgası (The Fight of Straw Bread) started in the history of Turkish press. Safa was accused of being Bolshevik for participating in the discussions titled Putları Yıkıyoruz (We Are Destroying the Idols), which started in Resimli Ay, together with Nâzım Hikmet and writing articles in the left-wing newspaper Tan. But he always denied these allegations. The friendship of the two continued after the closing of Resimli Ay. In time, Nâzım Hikmet's desire to bring him to communism and as a result of his efforts to discourage Nâzım Hikmet from this ideology, this friendship turned into a great hostility. Nâzım Hikmet accused Peyami Safa in his article titled Coffee and Casino Intellectuals written in Tan under the pseudonym Orhan Selim. Peyami Safa also responded to Nâzım Hikmet under the series titled Biraz Aydınlık in the magazine Hafta, which he published with his brother.  From this point on, Peyami Safa adopted an anti-communist worldview until the end of his life.  In the following process, Peyami Safa's works with the signature of Server Bedi and Cingöz Recai typing became the main subject of the discussions between the two.

Belén Fraga is a fictional character from the Argentine telenovela Chiquititas, also known as Tiny Angels. The character was portrayed by Romina Yan from 1995 to 1998 on television and on stage, as well as in the Chiquititas feature film. After her storyline ended in Season Four, she had some cameos in 2000 and 2001, during the series' seasons Six and Seven. 
In the short-lived Mexican series, Belén was portrayed by Ana Serradilla; she is played by actress Flávia Monteiro in the Brazilian successful adaptation of the serial, in which the character is named Carolina "Carol" Correia. 
Actress Manuela do Monte portrays Carol in the 2013 Brazilian version of the series.

In every version of the story, the character is a young woman who gradually becomes a maternal figure for several orphans living in a manor, known as Rincón de Luz. After Belén's storyline ended, she was replaced by three different characters in Chiquititass following seasons. Her role is taken by Ana Pizarro (Grecia Colmenares) in Season Five, Luz Liñares (Romina Gaetani) in Season Six, and Mili Urién (Agustina Cherri), a former chiquitita who returned for the show's final season.

Belén is not featured in Chiquititas Sin Fin, which plot focuses on the character of Magali "Lili" Garcia, a woman in the search for her lost son. Sin Fin is the only Chiquititas original series or season in which Belén is not featured or mentioned.

Storyline
Initially, Belén lived with her best friend Clarita, her sister Letícia, her niece Sol (Daniella Mastricchio), and her younger brother Piojo (Guido Kaczka). She used to work in one of the Morán's factories with Letícia, while studying to become a social assistant. She used to visit her godfather Saverio, who was
the orphanage's Chef. There, Belén acquired affection from its nine little internals, the chiquititas. She first met her boss in the factory, employer Martín Morán, and they gradually fell in love with each other. She helps him in the search for his sister Gaby's lost daughter, while they both help Mili, one of the orphans, in her search for her true identity. Martín is the first one offering Belén to the position of the orphanage's director, but the place is taken by Ginette, Ramiro's ambitious fiancée.

After Letícia dies, Belén develops a mother-and-daughter relation with Sol, since the little girl is left in sadness. Meanwhile, she and Martín found difficulty in their relationship, as his seductive secretary Dolores supposedly gets pregnant of him, what was later revealed to be a lie. Also, his father Ramiro is against the romance, since Belén is a lower-middle-class girl (for the very same reason Ramiro took Mili off Gaby, stating that the baby was stillborn, as Mili's father was of a lower class). 
When Sol got sick, Belén was blackmailed by Ramiro. She became unable to adopt Sol, and in order to provide the girl all the medical assistance she needed, Belén should definitely leave Martín's life, and so she did. Belén breaks up with him, and Ramiro is left confused and heartbroken. 
As Martín leaves Buenos Aires with Gaby, Ramiro repents and decides to tell his sons the truth about Mili. At the same time, Belén tries to stop Martín from leaving her. They both fail, as Ramiro suffers a car crash on the way, with Belén witnessing everything. Moments before his death, he tries to tell her the truth, but fails and succumbs to his injuries.

Belén and Martín were no longer together when she first met doctor Facundo Brausen (Fernán Mirás), after Jimena, one of the manor's orphans, suffered a serious accident and became paraplegic. Facundo was an impatient, surly man, who gradually changed after he meets Belén and the orphans, and because of Facundo's good actions, new children are later introduced to the Rincón de Luz manor. Belén is assisted by him, as she still suffers from Ramiro's tragic death, and still misses Martín. As time goes by, Belén sees herself in love with the doctor. After Carmen manages to close down their house, Belén receives the help of a mysterious man, and the children are given a new home. They are introduced to an enormous manor, located at the corner of the Harmony Alley. She states to the chiquititas that they are all tiny princess and princes, and the place will become their "castle".

Sol's biological father Alejo comes back, seeking for his daughter. The girl had become Belén's legal daughter, and Belén fights in court against the unscrupulous man for the girl's guard. Belén and Facundo's intense relationship is torn apart when his ex-wife Andrea, and his son Dieguito, return to his life. Andrea has a serious disease, and due to her condition, Facundo leaves Belén to take care of his family. Once again, she is left heartbroken. Alejo loses Sol's safekeeping for Belén, and apparently leaves.

Later, she meets Alejo's supposed identical twin brother, Manoel, who has moved to the Harmony Alley, where the manor is located. Belén finds out the truth about Manuel's true identity, while she needs to once again fight in court, now against Martirio, for the custody of all the orphans. Martirio is a typical hag with rogue intentions to the Rincón de Luz's internals. Belén and Alejo win in court, adopting the manor's remaining chiquititas, starting a family altogether.

Belén writes her story alongside the orphans in the Book of Life ("El Libro de La Vida"), and tells them that they now shall seek for their true happiness. She also writes about the future of each chiquitita.

Sightings
The character had some cameos after her story ended in Season Four, as a "spiritual" figure. Belén is not directly a character in Chiquititas Season Five, but Maria knows about her story due to the Book of Life, which the little girl has somehow acquired. Maria is an orphan living in the streets with her friends, until they discover an enormous granary that becomes their home. The Book is the only connection between both stories, and Maria follows Belén's messages about faith and hope, creating a new Rincón de Luz in the granary.

After the children become once again homeless, they are taken back to the Rincón de Luz manor, guided by a shooting star, in Chiquititas Season Six. There, Belén appears for them through the Magic Window ("La Ventanita de Los Sueños") in the attic, welcoming them to the Rincón de Luz, their new and definitive home, and stating that they should not give up their dreams, since they are the "greatest act to change the world".

Belén makes a last appearance on television in the series finale, in Season Seven. After the manor is destroyed by this season's villain Lidia, Mili and the chiquititas, watch the house rebuild itself, as Belén appears in the skies, as well as Mili's companions, the previous internals of the manor, appear among the orphans.

In film
In the Chiquititas feature film, Belén is a young woman who lives in a world of fantasy and music, and is surprised by a tiny elf named Tok. Tok takes her to a sympathetic wise man, who offers her one of his fairy tales. She should choose a story to live in, but Belén wants to write her own. She then picks the Book of Life, also named "The Tale Of The Blue Diamonds" by the wise man. Immediately after starting to read it, Belén ends up in a small, adorable village, where she meets Alejo, a charming but rude sourdough. She follows a note in the streets about an orphanage in need of a cooker, and is taken to that place, where the orphans are actually treated as slaves by its owners, the redoubtable Colonel and his attendant. Initially, Belén is not well received by the kids, and the wise man tells her that the greatest things are always the hardest to obtain. 
Belén gradually starts to change their lives, easing their suffering with love and songs. She sings for Sebastian while he is grounded after trying to escape from the manor, and for Maria, Tali and Juanita, during a stormy night. Also, she helps Camila to get closer to Felipe, Alejo's assistant.

Sebastian disappears from the manor, and Belén is told by the attendant that he would not cause problems anymore. She is gagged by the chiquititas, and Belén finds Sebastian trapped inside a trunk. She decides to tell the Mayor and his whole town about the Colonel's cruelties, and does so, but he does not believe in her. The Mayor orders her to take the chiquititas back to the manor, which Belén declines in order to protect them. They escape from the village, finding refuge in Alejo's cabin. 
There, Alejo tells them the legend of the Blue Diamonds, and states that they are "too close", and if found, their lives would be changed forever. Agustín has a magical artefact that indicates the Diamond's location, and he follows its way alongside Fred and Sebastian. Belén and the other children notice that they're gone, and go in search of them. Belén finds the boys inside the mine, with the ambitious Colonel, who also knows the legend of the Blue Diamonds, and also looks for them. Belén is attacked by the Colonel and faints. Alejo then arrives and tries to knock him down. After his henchman misses his shot, the mine starts to collapse. When the sunlight comes through the opening above, Belén remembers the lines about the Blue Diamonds. The kids realize that the Blue Diamonds are actually Belén's eyes. The Colonel is scared, believing that she's a "witch", and tries to attack her once again, but Alejo knocks him down. The cave crumbles and everybody except Alejo manages to leave the mine.
Outside, the Colonel and his Intendant are arrested. Belén and the children grieve as they think that Alejo died in the landslide, before the man emerges in the water, calling for Belén's name. 
Belén finally manages to change the orphan's lives forever, as she forms a family with them and Alejo. The Wiseman and Tok once again visit Belén, and she is congratulated for having a happy ending, which Belén contradicts, stating that it is her story is actually about to start.

The house was also renovated in the Colonial Revival style.  The north block was expanded to two stories in 1998.  Also on the property is a contributing carriage house built in 1869.  It was converted to a residence in 1925. It was built as a single family residence, but converted to a Quaker boarding home for the elderly in 1935–1936.  The boarding home closed at this location in 1997.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Plot summary
Death Unchained is set in the merciless regime of Falkovnia. A horde of dark and sinister assassins pursue the players from the moment they step out of the mists.

Publication history
Death Unchained was published by TSR in 1996, and was designed by Lisa Smedman, with cover art by Fred Fields and interior art by John Dollar.

Reception
Trenton Webb reviewed Death Unchained for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. Webb commented, "without a shadow of a doubt TSR's Death Unchained is a great off-the-shelf AD&D Ravenloft scenario". He declares that the adventure has "plenty of Hammer-horror atmosphere, but this time it's more akin to the paranoid fears of Witchfinder General than the schlock of Frankenstein". He called it a "hard core horror-fest" that "doesn't let up" against the player characters in its "non-stop chase through grim city streets and a beautifully labyrinthe dungeon complex". He notes that, for the DM, "it's a well-balanced adventure guide - it's strict enough to maintain direction but with enough flexibility and troubleshooting options to be useful under game conditions". Webb felt that Death Unchained'''s insight comes from "its more mainstream feel", as while he feels that many Ravenloft scenarios "have a late-Georgian atmosphere in which demi-humans and magic feel a tad anachronistic", this adventure "revels in a far more medieval flavour, essentially being set in downtown Transylvania at the time of Vlad Tepes". Webb concludes the review by saying: "Pushed along at a frantic pace, filled with plenty of clues which are clear enough for players to find and follow, and with a varied cast of refreshingly different villains, Death Unchained'' opens a promising trilogy. What's more, with its mainstream feel it's ideal for other world parties to test the murky waters of Ravenloft. However, if this is your first foray into the Demiplane of Dread, be warned - it's a real character killer."

BIDS Helper is a Visual Studio open source extension with multiple features that extend and enhance business intelligence development functionality in all editions of Microsoft's SQL Server 2005, 2008, 2008 R2 and 2012. BIDS Helper improves the development environment for integration, analysis and reporting services.  BIDS Helper is hosted on GitHub.

History

BIDS Helper was initially released on May 27, 2007. BI Developer Extensions for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 is published in the Visual Studio Gallery.
The last version for SQL 2005 (Visual Studio 2005), SQL 2008 (Visual Studio 2008), SQL 2008 R2 (Visual Studio 2008), BIDS Helper 1.7.0 was released on March 17, 2015.

In Version 1.5, released on June 7, 2011, Varigence contributed key portions of the Biml engine, including dynamic package generation to BIDS Helper. Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML-based language that allows a developer to describe a BI solution in a declarative fashion, similarly to using HTML to describe how a web page should appear. Version 1.5 also had the Expression Editor contributed by Konesans.

Features

BIDS Helper has dozens of features that improve the functionality of BIDS, SSIS and SSAS. They are classified into one of five categories listed below based on where they increase functionality in SQL Server:

Analysis Services Multidimensional
Aggregation Manager - an advanced interface for manually editing aggregations 
Calculation Helpers -  enhances the Calculations tab of the cube editor 
Column Usage Reports - opens two reports about column usage: Unused Columns Report + Used Columns Report 
Delete Unused Aggregations - automates the process of detecting which aggregations are unused and deleting them 
Deploy Aggregation Designs - deploys just the aggregation designs in a cube. It does not change which aggregation design is assigned to each partition 
Deploy MDX Script - allows for right clicking on a cube in an Analysis Services solution and deploy just the calculation script  
Dimension Data Type Discrepancy Check - runs checks that DSV data types match the data types on the KeyColumns and NameColumn of dimension attributes. It displays any discrepancies and lets the user fix them with the click of a button. 
Dimension Health Check - checks various indications of dimension health  
Dimension Optimization Report - This report lists all dimension attributes and hierarchies on rows. On columns, it lists various properties which can be used to optimize dimensions. 
Duplicate Role -  copies a role with all of the associated settings and permissions 
Many-to-Many Matrix Compression - Analyzing the data in a m2m relationship to determine whether it can be compressed significantly requires building a complex SQL query. This feature automates this process and returns a report showing how much each m2m relationship can be compressed. 
Measure Group Health Check - checks various indications of measure group health. 
Non-Default Properties Report - generates a report which shows all properties which have been changed from their defaults. 
Parent-Child Dimension Naturalizer -  aids in converting parent-child dimensions into natural hierarchies. 
Printer Friendly Aggregations - allows for printing or exporting to PDF a report that lists every aggregation in a cube.  
Printer Friendly Dimension Usage - allows viewing and printing of a report encompassing all the information from the Dimension Usage tab.  
Roles Report - recursively list the members of the role and the members of groups in order to easily determine which members actually have access via each role 
Similar Aggregations - allows viewing a report that lists any aggregations which are very similar to each other.
Smart Diff - compares versions of a SSAS, SSIS, and SSRS files. BIDS Helper pre-processes XML files so that the diff versus source control is more meaningful.

Show Extra Properties - exposes hidden properties on several Analysis Services objects. It also provides a better UI for editing descriptions on Analysis Services objects.
 
Sync Descriptions - if the source database has descriptions for relational tables and columns (for example, using the Kimball Dimensional Modeling Spreadsheet) this function will import those descriptions to the dimension in Analysis Services.
Test Aggregation Performance - test the performance of aggregations 
Tri-State Perspectives - this feature operates in the Perspectives tab of the cube designer. It highlights any measure groups or dimensions in which not all visible children are part of the perspective 
Update Estimated Counts - updates the EstimatedCount property of every dimension attribute and every partition with exact counts 
Validate Aggregations - quickly check whether any aggregations violate restrictions or best practices 
Visualize Attribute Lattice - allows for visually seeing the attribute relationships that have been defined for a dimension in an Analysis Services solution

Analysis Services Tabular
Smart Diff - compares versions of a SSAS, SSIS, and SSRS files. BIDS Helper pre-processes XML files so that the diff versus source control is more meaningful. 
Tabular Actions Editor - provides a UI for editing actions for Tabular models. For example, this feature allows the model designer the ability to customize the columns returned by drillthrough. 
Tabular Display Folders - provides a UI for editing display folders on measures, columns, and hierarchies. All display folders are edited in the same place.  
Tabular HideMemberIf - allows HideMemberIf setting to be changed 
Tabular Pre-Build -  catches the build event and checks features for BIDS Helper settings that have been lost. Because these settings were backed up in annotations, they can be restored, and the user will be prompted if this is necessary. 
Tabular Sync Descriptions -  if the source database has descriptions for relational tables and columns (for example, using the Kimball Dimensional Modeling Spreadsheet) this function will import those descriptions to the table in a Tabular model in Analysis Services.
Tabular Translations Editor -  allows for coding in one language but display the model to users in another language. For example, the model might be coded in English but display to users in Spanish.

Integration Services
Batch Property Update -  Allows for updating multiple packages properties at once 
Biml Package Generator - provides the ability to create packages from Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml)
Create Fixed Width Columns - allows for the use of an Excel spreadsheet to create the column definitions in a few simple steps. 
Deploy SSIS Packages - quickly deploy SSIS packages directly from BIDS without having to create a deployment manifest and use the Package Installation Wizard. 
Design Warnings -  provides similar functionality to the Design Warning feature in Analysis Services 2008. It compares the current package against a list of design guidelines, and adds warnings to the Error List in Visual Studio for any items that need to be investigated. 
dtsConfig File Formatter -  watches for when a window is activated or created for a file with a .dtsConfig extension and automatically initiates the Visual Studio formatting feature 
Expression and Configuration Highlighter - gives a visual indicator so that the influence of expressions and package configurations can be seen at a glance

Christmas Carol Kauffman (December 25, 1901 – January 30, 1969) was an American author of Mennonite Christian literature. Kauffman was best known for her semi-biographical novels, and her writings were largely based on the life stories of people she met through the mission work she performed with her husband, pastor Nelson E. Kauffman. She is mother of James Kauffman.

Biography

Early life
Christmas Carol Miller was born on December 25, 1901, in Elkhart, Indiana, to Selena and Abraham Miller, and named in honor of her Christmas-morning birth. She graduated from Elkhart High School, after which she worked a clerk job, and enrolled for a short time at Goshen College. On April 16, 1924, Christmas Carol was married to Norman Hostetler; on June 16, 1926, he was electrocuted while installing a radio antenna.

Remarriage and Hannibal Mission work

In January 1928, at the suggestion of Bishop Jacob K. Bixler, Christmas Carol Hostetler took a vacation from her employment at a sewing shop and enrolled in a six-week winter Bible term at Hesston College. Here she began to recognize a strong interest in applying herself to mission work, although she’d previously been unwilling to follow her husband Norman’s plan to travel to India to work in missions. Christmas Carol left her sewing shop job and enrolled for another semester at Hesston College, where she met Nelson E. Kauffman, who shared her new interest in missions. The two married on June 10, 1929. After Nelson had completed a degree from Hesston College and spent several years teaching, Christmas Carol and Nelson began seeking out opportunities for service positions.

In Spring of 1934, the two accepted the Mennonite General Mission Board’s call to start a mission church in Hannibal, Missouri. This Gospel Mission was founded in Hannibal on June 3, 1934, under the South Central Mennonite Conference, and would eventually become known as the Mennonite Mission Church. While serving in the area for the next 22 years, their mission work received national recognition, Nelson was appointed as bishop over five congregations and as President of the Mennonite Board of Education, and Christmas Carol published several novels based on stories of those she met or stories which were submitted to her. Of particular note is the work of the Hannibal mission within several Missouri prisons, work which resulted in the conversion and baptism of Johnnie Allison, who would eventually be convicted of the murder of his father-in-law. As a result of a personal connection with Nelson and Christmas Carol Kauffman, Allison became passionately religious, and worked to convert other prisoners, even creating a Mennonite church within the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City. Johnnie Allison and Christmas Carol Kauffman would collaborate to publish the story of his conversion under the name Life with Life, although Allison's wife raised a libel lawsuit over its publication. After his release, Allison maintained a friendship with the Kauffmans, and even visited Christmas Carol while she was hospitalized in Elkhart, Indiana.

After ending their mission work in Hannibal in 1956, the Kauffmans moved to Elkhart, Indiana, where Nelson served as Secretary of Home Missions for the Mennonite Mission Board and the two began attending Belmont Mennonite Church. Christmas Carol remained in Elkhart until her death in 1969.

Writing career
Christmas Carol Kauffman’s writing career began during her studies at Hesston College, when C.F. Yake, one of her professors, asked Christmas Carol to submit a short story to the magazine he served as editor of, the Youth’s Christian Companion. She would go on to write more than 100 stories for the weekly, and several of her novels were serialized within the Companion before being published. Christmas Carol wrote in longhand, standing up at a table or desk, and these pages were sent to friends or typists to be typed into manuscripts. Although she gathered information for her first novel for two years, Carol did not begin writing the manuscript, the life story of a Hannibal congregant which would become Lucy Winchester, until during her hospital stay after giving birth to her fourth child, in September 1942.

After the successful publication of Lucy Winchester, Christmas Carol would go on to write a number of other similar semi-biographical novels, including Light from Heaven, Dannie of Cedar Cliffs, Search to Belong, Hidden Rainbow, and For One Moment, as well as the historical fiction novel, Not Regina, all of which were initially published by Mennonite Publishing House.

Death
In 1967, Christmas Carol was admitted to Elkhart General Hospital and diagnosed with infectious hepatitis. She eventually recovered and was able to return home, but in January 1969, she was readmitted and died of hepatitis on January 30, 1969.

Legacy
Kauffman's novels were widely read at the time of their publication, and several are still in print today, in editions by Christian Light Publications. Her works have been translated into Japanese, German, Norwegian, Finnish, and French.

Christmas Carol's personal papers and publishing files are housed in the Mennonite Church USA Archives.

The Roger Williams Handicap was an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually at Narragansett Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and named for the founder of the State of Rhode Island. The track sat on land just west of the Ten Mile River which Roger Williams traveled down after being banished from Massachusetts in 1636. The track management had purchased the land from the former What Cheer Airport in 1934. Curiously, “What cheer, Netop” were the words called out by the Narragansett Indians when Roger Williams first set foot in the place he was to call "Providence". Only the word Netop − meaning "friend" − is Indian and the phrase was meant as a greeting.

The first big Saturday stakes race run at Narragansett Park was the $7,500 added Roger Williams Handicap. On August 4, 1934, C.V. Whitney's Roustabout won by a head with jockey Al Robertson aboard. The first five editions were run at one mile.

The 1935 race saw Advising Anna set a track record of 1:37 that would never be broken.  As Narragansett was a one-mile track, this led to a short run to the first turn and the one mile distance was seldom used. Fair Knightess, who had gained notoriety for her Massachusetts Handicap battle with Seabiscuit, won the race in 1937 and was soon purchased by Charles S. Howard.

After a two-year hiatus the Roger Williams Handicap was reinstated at the distance of 1 1/16th mile. From 1941 to 1948 the added money event was held at this distance and drew top handicap horses, owners, trainers and jockeys to the track. In 1946 it was W. G. Loew's Helioptic winning the $13,275 event before a post-war crowd of more than 30,000 that bet 1.79 million dollars. Helioptic had been bred by the famous Coldstream Stud of Kentucky.

In 1949, the purse was up to $16,700 and the race was extended to 1 3/16 mile, the same distance as the prestigious Narragansett Special. Before a big weekend gathering it was Calumet Farm's Coaltown winning by 12 lengths in a performance that led trainer H.A. Jones to send Coaltown to Chicago. He proceeded to win four big races of the Midwest, set a new world record for the mile (1:34), and was named Handicap Horse of the Year. Those that saw him run would remember the experience for years. Coaltown would be inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1983.

By its last four runnings, the Roger Williams Handicap served as a prep race for the much richer Narragansett Special as the Rhode Island Handicap was discontinued. On October 30, 1954 the Roger Williams Handicap was dusted off one last time and run at 1 1/16 miles. Red Head Stable's Blue Dare, with Paul Bohenko up, won the race by a length and a half in the mud at 8−1 on the tote board.

The Dallara GC21 was a Le Mans Prototype built by Dallara for the Fuji Grand Champion Series, and based on one of the company's Formula Three cars. It was raced between 2002 and 2007, competing in the LMP2 class of the Japan Le Mans Challenge in the last two years of its usage. A GC21, entered by MYZ, won the LMP2 category of the Japan Le Mans Challenge in 2006.

History
In 2002, the Fuji Grand Champion Series was revived, under the GC21 name. Dallara were tasked with building a car for the series, and converted one of their Formula Three cars into the Le Mans Prototype-style Dallara GC21. The GC21 featured the distinctive air intake of a F3 car, but was fitted with a 2-litre, turbocharged Toyota 3S-GTE straight-four engine, in place of the naturally-aspirated units used in F3.

The car's first race came in July 2002, the first of four races that year, all of which were held at the Fuji Speedway circuit. Jerome Dalla Lana, driving for Inging, became the first driver to win in the car, with all five entries finishing the twelve lap event. By the final race of the season, held in November, the grid had expanded to eight cars, with Ronnie Quintarelli, also driving for Inging, winning the event. Only once did a GC21 retire in 2002; Naozumi Itou retired from race three after three laps.

2003 saw the series expand to a five-race event, all of which were held at the Fuji Speedway track. Shinsuke Yamazaki, driving for Aim Sports, won the first event, held in March, with six cars being entered. Each of the following events had seven entries. The final race of the season saw the first mechanically attributed retirement; the privateer Kazuhiko Yatsu suffered a gearbox failure after five laps, in a race where Yamazaki won again. Yamazaki won three races that year, and took two further second places on the way to securing the title.

For 2004, the closure of Fuji Speedway as part of a Hermann Tilke redesign of the circuit forced the series to move. As a result, four races were held at the road course of Twin Ring Motegi, as well as one at Sportsland Sugo. Hiroki Saga, driving for MYG, won four races on the way to the title, with the other race being won by Nova Engineering's Katsuaki Kubota. However, the entry list had decreased, with no more than five drivers competing in any of the races. Fuji Speedway reopened in 2005, and the GC-21 series returned there for all five races of the season. Team I Line's Hiroaki Ishiura was dominant, winning all five races.

In 2006, the Japan Le Mans Challenge (JLMC) was run for the first time, and the GC21 competed in that series in the LMP2 category, as well as the GC-21 series, which continued for one final season. Yasuo Miyagawa won two races of the GC21 series whilst driving for RS Serizawa whilst Atsushi Katsumata won three races driving for MYG. In the JLMC, MYZ entered two GC21 in the season opener, which was the Sugo 1000 km, whilst Aim Sports entered a single GC21. The MYZ entries didn't have any success; the #3 car, driven by Masayuki Yamamoto, Syougo Suhou and Jun'ichirou Yamashita retired, whilst the #4 car, driven by Yuuya Sakamoto, Yoshihisa Namekata and Tomonobu Fujii wasn't classified. However, the Aim Sports car, driven by Shinsuke Yamazaki, Yuuji Asou and Masaru Tomizawa, took the LMP2 class win, and finished second overall. At the Motegi 1000 km, the two team's finishes were reversed: the Aim Sports entry retired due to engine failure, whilst both MYZ entries finished; the #4 MYZ car took the class win, and finished second overall, whilst the #3 MYZ car finished third overall. The #4 MYZ car won the LMP2 category again at the season finale, which was the Okayama 1000 km, whilst both of the other GC21s retired. As a result, MYZ won the LMP2 Team's Championship, and Sakamoto, Namekata and Fujii won the LMP2 Driver's Championship.

2007 saw the JLMC expand to a four-race series, whilst the GC21 was discontinued. For the season opener, which was the Sugo 1000 km, two GC21s were entered; one by Kazuyoshi Takamizawa, and one by Aim Sports, who entered Tomizawa, Asou and Yoshitaka Kuroda. Although Takamizawa did not attend the event, Aim Sports did, and finished fourth, winning the LMP2 category. Aim Sports were the only GC21 in the Fuji 1000 km, and once more won their class, finishing second overall. Three GC21s were entered in the Motegi 1000 km; the regular Aim Sports car was complemented by an entry from Forward Racing, who had Takuya Shirasaka and Takeshi Itou driving for them, as well as an entry from Rs Serizawa, who ran Hiroshi Koizumi, Tsubasa Kurosawa and Hiroaki Ishiura in their GC21. For the first time in the series, the LMP2 category was won by another car; the Max Racing-entered RS KK-LM won the class. The Aim Sports GC21 finished fifth overall, and second in class, whilst the Forward Racing entry was not classified, and the Rs Serizawa entry retired. Aim Sports were once again the only entry in the season finale, which was the Okayama 1000 km; the team took an overall victory for the first time, beating the Team Mugen Courage LC70 LMP1 by just over 28 seconds. This would prove to be both the car's, and the series', last race, as the JLMC was cancelled shortly after the Okayama 1000 km had finished.

Top attended games
Ali Ahmed Ali Mohamed Ghazal (born 1 February 1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer who last played as a defensive midfielder or as a centre back for Wadi Degla. He made 11 appearances for the Egypt national team between 2014 and 2019.

He began his career as a youth player with El Sekka El Hadid before joining Wadi Degla in 2006. In 2013, despite having not played a senior game, he was sold to Portuguese club Nacional where he made his professional debut. After establishing himself in the first team, he was later named captain of the club, becoming the first Egyptian player to captain a top-tier European team. He joined Chinese side Guizhou Zhicheng in 2017 but changes to the league's foreign player quota resulted in him never playing a league match and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent. Following his release, he joined Vancouver in 2017, helping the side reach the MLS Cup Playoffs in his first season.

In May 2013, Ghazal was called up to the Egypt national team, making his international debut a year later.

Club career

Youth
Born in Aswan, Ghazal grew up in Cairo playing football on the streets. His father and uncle were both former footballers. His nephews were invited to a trial with El Sekka El Hadid and asked Ghazal to go with them where he impressed the club's coaches and was offered a contract. His performances with El Hadid attracted attention from both Zamalek, where he trained with the squad for a month, and Al Ahly but transfers to both clubs collapsed over El Hadid's asking price. Mohamed Abbas who had worked as a coach with Zamalek during Ghazal's spell there was eventually appointed manager of Wadi Degla and persuaded him to join the side at the age of fourteen.

Degla were owned by Egyptian businessman Maged Sammy who also owned Belgian side Lierse and arranged a trial with the club when Ghazal turned eighteen. Ghazal later commented on his relationship ship with Sagny, stating "Samy is like a big brother to me, one of those who really believed in me from the very start, he made sure I trained well and even got me a personal English tutor to improve my language." He spent a month on trial with Lierse but was not offered a contract.

Nacional
Having been turned down by Lierse, Ghazal instead assembled a video of him playing for Degla's youth team and sent it to a scout he met online. The scout sent the video to coaches of Portuguese club Nacional, who submitted an offer to sign Ghazal and the transfer was completed in 2012 for a fee of €40,000.

After arriving at the club, Ghazal initially struggled to adapt to the pace of football in Portugal, later commenting: "I had no clue about anything. I took time in that first half season. I was not performing that well". He helped the side qualify for the UEFA Europa League and his performances attracted the attention of clubs from Italy and France, but their offers were rejected by the Nacional board.

At the start of the 2016–17 season, Ghazal scored his first senior professional goal during a 3–2 defeat to Belarusian side Dinamo Minsk in the Europa League. Ghazal later became the youngest person to captain the club at the age of 24 during a match against Marítimo and was later appointed as the club's permanent captain, becoming the first Egyptian player to captain a top-tier European side. In February 2016, he made his 100th appearance in all competitions for Nacional during a 1–1 draw with Vitória.

In 2017, he was sold to Chinese club Guizhou Zhicheng for a fee of €2.6 million following Nacional's relegation to LigaPro at the end of the 2016–17 season. But, as a result of new Chinese Football Association player regulations which limited the number of foreign players allowed to play in matches, Ghazal was unable to play for the club in the league, making one Chinese FA Cup appearance for the club, during a 5–3 defeat to Shanghai Shenxin, before the club mutually agreed to terminate his contract.

Vancouver Whitecaps FC
On 10 August 2017, Ghazal signed with Major League Soccer club Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Whitecaps manager Carl Robinson later revealed that the club had previously tried to sign Ghazal prior to his move to China and had been in contact with him for two months before he eventually signed. He made his debut a month later, starting in a 3–2 defeat against San Jose Earthquakes, earning praise from Robinson who described his performance as "absolutely top class." He made seven regular season appearances for the Whitecaps and played in all three of their MLS postseason playoff matches, reaching the semi-final before losing to Seattle Sounders FC. Ghazal was released by Vancouver at the end of their 2018 season.

International career
After playing for the Egyptian under-20 side, Ghazal received his first call-up to the senior squad under manager Bob Bradley in 2013 but did not feature. He made his international debut under Bradley's successor Shawky Gharieb, being named in the starting line-up for a 2–0 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina on 5 March 2014. He earned four further caps in 2014, including two in Egypt's unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.

Ghazal later criticised Egypt manager Héctor Cúper over his continued omission from national team squads, commenting "I play well with Nacional so it's normal to join the national team as there are players (who have) failed to save regular places in their team, but they have been called for the camps." In 2018, he held talks with Cuper over returning to the national team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup but was not included.

Thom Wall (born February 9, 1987) is a juggler and variety entertainer from Saint Louis, Missouri, USA. NPR has called him "one of the world's most notable jugglers."

Wall is known for his avant-garde performance style, cultivated through training at the New England Center for Circus Arts, lessons with mime Karen Montanaro, and training with long-time friend Curtis Carlyle. In 2009, Wall competed at the World Juggling Federation's "Winter Blitz" event. No judge had seen any of his creative five-ball tricks performed before, so his routine was deemed unscoreable.  In 2017, the Smithsonian Institution called Thom an "elite practitioner of the craft of juggling."

Thom is one of the last gentleman jugglers performing in the world today - a performance style where relatable objects are manipulated in clever ways.  His work with mouthstick and balance have given him a notoriety in the circus world, often being referred to as "one of the world's top jugglers". In 2015, Dr. Salvador Calva Morales, chancellor of La Universidad Mesoamericana in Puebla, Mexico - home to Mexico's traditional circus school - was quoted as saying "...I dare say that [Thom] is the greatest balancer in the entire world."  In 2017, Smithsonian Magazine referred to Thom as "...an elite practitioner of the craft of juggling." NPR has called Wall "...one of the world's most notable jugglers."

In November 2017, Thom married fellow circus performer Chloe Somers, who worked with Thom to revive and popularize the old circus discipline of "bottle walking" in the United States. The two separated in 2019, when Somers signed a contract with The Seven Fingers. 

Thom left Cirque du Soleil's show Totem after its premiere at London's Royal Albert Hall in January, 2019, to pursue work on cruise ships. He was quoted as saying "My time here has been amazing, but 1,500 shows is... yeah, that's enough for me. Maybe I'll come back, but it's not in my plans for the immediate future." He worked for Cirque du Soleil as a headline act from 2014 through 2019. Wall now lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he teaches Circus History and Career Planning at Circadium: School of Contemporary Circus.

In the fall of 2021, Wall joined Cirque Mechanics' revamp of their flagship show Birdhouse Factory.

In 2022, Thom returned to working as a headline entertainer for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.

Career Highlights
In 2014, Thom competed at the International Jugglers' Association (IJA) Senior Stage Championships with a traditional mouthstick juggling act.  This act was awarded the bronze medal, making it the first time the discipline has been awarded a competition medal in the championships' 67-year history.

Thom was hired by Cirque du Soleil in April 2014 (to replace juggler, Greg Kennedy) in their touring show Totem. He worked for the company in a temporary position, performing shows in America, Canada and New Zealand before being replaced by Chris Chiappini in September 2014. Thom was then rehired by Cirque in February 2016 as a last-minute replacement for the Japan tour - this was possibly the fastest re-integration ever into a Cirque du Soleil show, as Thom was given eight hour's notice before catching a flight to Tokyo. After the Japanese tour ended in the Summer of 2017, he signed a full- time contract with the company as their permanent juggling act.  He performed with the show through their European tour in 2019 before moving on to work for Royal Caribbean International as a guest entertainer, performing his own show on cruise ships.

In 2013, Thom was the first person to ever juggle six knives.  To date, he's the only person to accomplish this feat.

In 2014, Thom and Benjamin Domask debuted their new creation "The Dinner and a Show Show" at the Kansas City Fringe Festival, where it received top honors.

In 2015, Thom joined the Celebration Barn Theater's new performance ensemble in their creation of "Traveling Light."

In 2017, Thom was the face of the American juggling tradition at the 50th annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, DC, where he hosted panel discussions and performed a daily lecture and demonstration of the history of juggling. The show he presented there, called On the Topic of Juggling has been referred to as "part stand up comedy, part TedX, and part juggling show."

Also in 2017, one of the glasses from Thom's mouthstick act was inducted into the Museum of Historical Juggling Props in Middletown, Ohio.  Museum curator, David Cain, reflected on the induction of this gentleman juggler's props by saying "Thom is one of the brightest stars in the juggling world. He has a wide array of skills but what he is known for few people (jugglers) do."

In 2018, Drexel University named Thom one of their "40 under 40" - recognizing him as one of the university's most promising alumni thanks to his work in the circus arts and American nonprofit arts community.

In 2019, his book Juggling - From Antiquity to the Middle Ages was published, reaching #1 on Amazon's charts for Theater History & Criticism the day of release. Three months after the book's release, its eBook format was awarded "Best Nonfiction Book of 2019" by the Next Generation Indie Book Awards.

In 2021, Wall joined the Board of Directors of the Celebration Barn Theater, one of the premier physical comedy schools in the world.

In 2021, Wall was awarded the International Jugglers' Association's "Excellence in Education Award".  Thom was the 18th honoree with this title in the organization's 74-year history, and the youngest to receive this lifetime achievement honor.

In 2022, Wall was named a "distinguished alumni" from his high school, Ladue Horton Watkins High School in St Louis, Missouri, for his work in the performing arts, alongside internationally renowned pianist Ingrid Jacoby.

Juggling - From Antiquity to the Middle Ages 
In 2019, Wall published the book Juggling - From Antiquity to the Middle Ages: the forgotten history of throwing and catching  with the imprint Modern Vaudeville Press.  This book "...is an attempt to catalogue this tangible history of juggling in human culture. It is the story of juggling, represented in art and writing from around the world, across time,"  filling a large gap in the literature surrounding circus arts, juggling, and theater.  The book is a departure from his show and lecture at the Smithsonian Institution's annual Folklife Festival. The book is currently used as a course material in anthropology classes at a number of universities in the USA.

Circus Report magazine called the book "the most important literature review to exist in the community of juggling," a point which many other reviewers have echoed. Three months after the book's release, its eBook edition was awarded "Best Nonfiction Book of 2019" by the Next Generation Indie Book Awards.

The Spanish translation was released in October, 2020 in both electronic and physical formats.

Juggling: What It Is and How to Do It 
Wall's second literary endeavor, Juggling: What It Is and How to Do It - A not-so-brief guide to the world's most underrated pastime, was published on August 31, 2020 by Modern Vaudeville Press. This book is an in-depth guide to juggling fundamentals, and has been called "one of the top ten instruction books ever written." The book reached Amazon bestseller status before publication. It was also a finalist in the 2021 Next Generation Indie Book Awards "Novelty and Gift" category. The title is currently being used as a course text in occupational therapy programs across the USA.

Education 
Wall attended Washington University in St. Louis, where he earned a degree in Germanic Languages and Literatures under Herr Dr. Paul Michael Lützeler. He was drawn to Washington University due to its "robust language offerings" across a variety of linguistic families. In his time there, he studied Spanish, Portuguese, German, Arabic, ESL, and illustration and design.  He speaks Spanish and Arabic and has taught workshops in both languages, and holds teaching credentials from Cambridge University.

He also holds a master's degree in Nonprofit Arts Administration from Drexel University.  His thesis revolved around the branding of nonprofit circus organizations in the United States.

Thom was a member of the 2012 Professional Development Program at the New England Center for Circus arts, where he trained juggling and hoop diving.

Community service
Wall served on the board of directors of the International Jugglers' Association between 2009 and 2013. During his tenure on the board of directors, he helped found the a new international competition format, helped implement eJuggle, the IJA's electronic magazine, and started the IJA's annual Video Tutorial Contest, which has brought hundreds of hours of high-quality, free-to-access juggling tutorials to the internet.

Wall is widely credited by members of the juggling community with helping turn the International Jugglers' Association around - when he was first elected to the board of directors, the organization was in the middle of a public relations crisis on the usenet forum Rec.Juggling. His work with online educational programs, global outreach, and benefits to new members through the new online magazine has brought the 70-year-old organization many new members, much new respect, and financial solvency.

His work with the International Jugglers' Association inspired him to pursue a master's degree in Nonprofit Arts Administration through Drexel University.  In a 2012 interview, Thom's primary interests in arts administration were cited to be strategic planning, PR, and marketing.

In 2020, Wall was made an MLA Field Bibliographer, helping the organization cultivate its inaugural Circus Arts bibliography.

Wall has coached a number of notable jugglers throughout their careers, including Sam Malcolm, Benjamin Domask, and Tony Steinbach.

In 2021, Wall was awarded the "Excellence in Education" award by the International Jugglers' Association. The occasion was recognized by the state of Pennsylvania, with senators Bob Casey (D) and Patrick Toomey (R) raising the US flag over the Capitol Building to mark the honor on different days. Senator Bob Casey was recorded explaining his decision: "[We raised the flag] to honor Thomas Wall - an academic and circus performer who works to preserve American Performing Arts history. This [award] is a lifetime achievement." Wall was the 28th person to receive the accolade since the organization's inception in 1947.

When asked about his work with Modern Vaudeville Press, Wall states "I'm just grateful to preserve people's life's work." He also makes a point of donating books whenever he performs shows for schools and other community-driven organizations.

Wall has been a member of the board of directors of the Celebration Barn Theater since 2021.

International Recognition 
In 2014, Wall competed at the Zelta Karlis circus festival in Riga, Latvia.  He was presented with the "People's Choice" special prize, given to the act found "...most pleasurable to the Latvian people."

In 2015, Wall was invited to perform at the 3rd annual Festival Universario de Circo, circus festival held at La Universidad Mesoamericana, which is home to the Mexico's traditional circus school, in Puebla, Mexico.  At the culmination of the festival, he was presented with the Crotalus Scholaris Medal - the highest award the university offers.  Chancellor Salvador Calva Morales stated that the award was to "indelibly recognize Thomas Wall's work as a juggler."

In 2017, Wall was invited to teach a fifteen-hour masterclass workshop at the Periplo International Circus Festival in Guadalajara, Mexico.  He also debuted his new one-man show On the Topic of Juggling at the event.

In 2019, Wall was invited to the Zelka circus festival in Lublin, Poland to present On the Topic of Juggling at the country's national juggling festival.

In 2021, Wall was awarded the "Excellence in Education" award by the International Jugglers' Association.

Marie Charlotte de La Trémoille (26 January 1632 – 24 August 1682). was a French noblewoman member of the House of La Trémoille and by marriage Duchess of Saxe-Jena.

Born in Thouars, she was the fifth of six children born from the marriage of Henri III de La Trémoille, 3rd Duke of Thouars, 2nd Duke of La Tremoille, Prince of Talmond and Taranto, and Marie de La Tour d'Auvergne.

Life
In Paris on 10 June 1662 Marie Charlotte (aged 30) married Prince Bernhard (aged 23), fourth surviving son of William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. The wedding was arranged by Duke William with the purpose to strengthen the relations of the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin with King Louis XIV. However, the negotiations delayed for almost eight months until a bride was chosen; her family was one of the most prestigious of France, where they bore the rank of princes étrangers.

Marie Charlotte moved with her husband to Jena, who was designed by her late father-in-law as Bernhard's eventual inheritance (although he formally assumed the government over his lands only in 1672). They had five children, of whom only one survived to adulthood:

William (Jena, 24 July 1664 – Jena, 21 June 1666).
Stillborn daughter (Jena, 7 April 1666).
Bernhard (Jena, 9 November 1667 – Jena, 26 April 1668).
Charlotte Marie (Jena, 20 December 1669 – Gräfentonna, 6 January 1703), married on 2 November 1683 to Wilhelm Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Weimar; they divorced in 1690.
Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Jena (Jena, 28 March 1675 – Jena, 4 November 1690).

The union was completely unhappy, and shortly after he obtain the overlordship of Jena, Bernhard wanted divorce Marie Charlotte in order to marry his mistress, Marie Elisabeth of Kospoth, one of the ladies of his court, who on 20 September 1672 bore him a daughter, Emilie Eleonore.

However, the Duke's efforts for a legal separation from his wife proved to be unsuccessful, as no theologian or jurist could give him grounds for divorce; however, Bernhard didn't abandoned his mistress and finally in 1674 they were married by a Jesuit priest named Andreas Wigand. Thus, Bernhard became one of the few cases of bigamy among princes. The wedding was null and void shortly after; resigned, Bernhard decided to reconcile with Marie Charlotte, who one year later gave birth the long-waited heir.

Marie Charlotte died in Jena aged 50, having survived her husband and three of her children. She was buried in the Stadtkirche, Jena.

The World Bowling Singles Championships is a Ten-pin bowling event open to members of World Bowling. This gives World Bowling a World Championship event every year, filling a void left from previous years. Each member federation can send up to two men and two women to compete. The event is split up into two separate tournaments, one for men and one for women.

Event Details and history
The first WB Singles Championships was held on September 18–26, 2012 in Limassol, Cyprus at the Galactica Bowling Center and subsequently will be held every four years. The second edition was held December 2–9, 2016 at Qatar Bowling Center in Doha. The third edition was to be held at South Point Tournament Bowling Plaza in Las Vegas, United States in 2020. On March 9, 2020, World Bowling and QubicaAMF announced a merger of the World Singles Championships and the QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup into one annual event, to be continued to be called the QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup from 2020 onwards

Format
In the 2012 WB Singles Championships, each bowler (men and women) bowled 12 games of qualifying split into two six game blocks. The top 24 men and women, by total pinfall, advanced to single-elimination match play. The first round of match play consisted of bowlers who qualified 9th to 24th. The second round of match play consisted of the first round winners and bowlers who qualified 1st to 8th who received a first round bye. Quarterfinals consisted of second round winners. First round, second round, and quarterfinals were best of five game matches. Quarterfinal winners advanced to the semi-finals, which were one game matches. Semi-final winners advanced to the finals, while semifinal losers receive a bronze medal. The finals is a one-game match to determine the gold medalist and the silver medalist for both the men and women.

For the 2016 WB Singles Championships, WB announced changes to the qualifying round and the final rounds. The qualifying rounds are still 12 games, but now split into three four game blocks. The top 32 men and women, by total pinfall, advanced to the next round. Instead of single-elimination match play, the next round has 32 bowlers (men and women) divided into four groups of eight bowlers bowling eight games starting from scratch. Each of the eight games is a match between all the bowlers in the group, with the bowler who had the highest score receiving seven points, second highest score receiving six points all the way to zero points for the lowest score in the game. The two bowlers with the highest number of points after eight games from each of the four groups will advance to play in one group of eight bowlers with a similar format from the previous round. After eight games in the final group, the top 4 point scorers will advance to the semi-finals. The semi-finals are one-game matches, no. 1 point scorer vs no. 4 point scorer and no. 2 point scorer vs no. 3 point scorer. The semi-final winners advance to the final, while the semi-final losers receive a bronze medal. The finals, also one-game matches, determines the gold and silver medalists.

Lane Pattern
All games in WB Singles Championships are played on one lane condition. In 2012, a medium pattern of 41 feet was used. In 2016, a medium pattern of 40 feet was chosen.

The Voice UK is a British television music competition to find new singing talent. The third series began airing on 11 January 2014 on BBC One, as opposed to the usual start in March. will.i.am and Tom Jones returned as coaches, while Kylie Minogue and Ricky Wilson joined the show as replacements for former coaches, Jessie J and Danny O'Donoghue. Emma Willis and Marvin Humes co-presented the show for the first time, replacing Holly Willoughby and Reggie Yates.

Jermain Jackman of Team Will was crowned as the winner of the series on 5 April 2014, making him the first male artist to win the show. Also, Jackman is the first winner in the show's history (before Ruti Olajugbagbe in the seventh series, Blessing Chitapa in the ninth series and Craig Eddie in the tenth series) to have only received one-chair turn in the blind auditions.

This series was the only series to feature Minogue as a coach.

Coaches

On 5 July 2013, Jessie J announced that she would not be returning as a coach for the third series due to touring commitments in support for her second album, Alive. On 16 July, it was announced that Danny O'Donoghue would not be returning either as he wanted to concentrate on The Script. People rumoured to be in the running to join the panel as replacements for Jessie J and O'Donoghue included Rita Ora, Emeli Sande, Kylie Minogue, Marvin Humes, Melanie C and Cheryl Cole, though Cole was ruled out of the running after rejoining rival show, The X Factor. On 11 September, it was confirmed that Minogue would become a coach for the third series, along with the confirmation of returning coaches will.i.am and Tom Jones. On 15 September, Holly Willoughby and Reggie Yates announced that they would not be returning to co-present the third series, and Emma Willis was announced as Willoughby's replacement.

On 9 February 2014, it was announced that Zoë Ball would present spin-off show The Voice: Louder on Two. The show was axed after the series.

Promotion
On 21 December 2013, the first trailer for the series premiered following the final of Strictly Come Dancing at 21:50. The trailer features all four coaches dressed in different medical costumes. They overlook a hospital ward, as many babies cry behind them. Then, the sound of a beautiful voice is heard from the direction of the babies, and stops all the crying. The voice captures the attention of Minogue and Wilson, who both turn around to see who is singing. will.i.am and Jones then turn, as the voice is revealed to be one of the babies, prompting the tagline "A Star is Born". On 1 January 2014, a new edition of the trailer aired, where another baby sings, in a more R&B style, also impressing the coaches.

As part of BBC One's promotion of its 2014 schedule, The Voice UK aired the first clips of the Blind Auditions, featuring a male artist walking to the microphone, a mother being reunited with her daughter following her performance, Emma Willis with a family watching a performance, the coaches' opening performance, and Minogue opening the trailer saying "This waiting, it's killer. And the anticipation", and she also tells an artist (unknown to the viewer) that they have "done the thing which is the thing that we [coaches] are waiting for."

On 6 January 2014, the series had its press launch at Broadcasting House. All four coaches were present, as were the two new presenters. The coaches spoke to members of the press, and in the week leading up to the premiere, the show was highly publicised by the British media, with coaches giving interviews in the Radio Times, The Metro, Digital Spy and The Telegraph. Later that day, will.i.am and Kylie Minogue appeared on the new-look One Show, where they talked about the show and last year's finalist, Leah McFall.

Post-show success
Bob Blakeley, who was originally rejected by all four coaches, was given a record deal on live television. He has since released an album.

Anna McLuckie's rendition of "Get Lucky" received much positive feedback particularly on YouTube, as the official BBC version of the audition received three million views only a month after it was released, and over twenty-eight million views up to now. Other users uploaded the video, each getting millions of views as well. This was particularly noted as none other from this series had achieved more than a million views yet, and had even surpassed videos from Series 1 and 2. When Anna was eliminated during the Knockout Rounds, her coach Will.i.am was subject to much criticism, particularly on Twitter and YouTube. Celebrities such as One Direction's Niall Horan even disagreed with his decision. Since the show, McLuckie has continued her studies.

During the live shows, the BBC released studio versions of the songs to iTunes. Christina Marie's rendition of Everlong reached the iTunes Top 40. This was particularly noted as the week prior to the live shows, she had been ill, and had rarely rehearsed it to preserve her voice.

Reception

Critical reception
Following lukewarm responses from the British media after the first two series of the show, the response to the third series premiere was largely positive. Ed Power from The Daily Telegraph gave the series premiere 3 stars, praising Minogue for being "glamorous, agreeably giggly [and] a card-carrying national treasure". Power said that she "was a natural" and that she had "spontaneity to go with sass". He also complimented Wilson for being "chipper and unforced". Catriona Wightman from Digital Spy was very positive about the premiere, claiming that despite "reservations about whether Kylie would really manage to break through the nice girl mode" she was "brilliantly watchable", and that "Kylie's definitely a hit". The second blind audition continued to receive positive reviews from critics, receiving 4 (out of 5) stars by Michael Hogan from The Daily Telegraph, who commented that the "two new coaches add verve to The Voice UK and the newly confident singing contest seems to have found its feet" and that the new series "is a leap forward and the franchise has finally hit its stride." However, the Battle Rounds were criticised, with Gabriel Tate from The Daily Telegraph stating there were "few stand out moments" in the second battle round. He also said that "after such a promising start to the third series, it's a shame to see that The Voice falling foul once again of slack editing and familiarity of format." Keith Watson of The Metro gave the second battle round two stars, stating that the show was full of "overambitious [artists] being made promises of stardom that will never come true". The final received more positive reviews from the press, with Ed Power from The Daily Telegraph giving it 4 out of 5 stars, stating that the "tension was terrible" and it was a "drama soaked final". He also answered whether or not the addition of Kylie Minogue on the show would be successful, by saying that "we needn't have fretted. Kylie, it was clear from the very first episode, was a natural in the coaches chair." He concluded that "series three was assuredly a triumph – after much smoke and noise, The Voice'' has at last achieved lift-off."

(officially translated as The Lightning of August) was the first novel written by Mexican author Jorge Ibargüengoitia. 

Published for the first time in 1964, the text parodies the memories written by veterans of the 1910 Mexican Revolution and the armed revolts that continued to destabilize the country for the next two decades. Since many of those veterans had joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) —a political organization that had ruled Mexico by rigging elections and engaging in massive corruption and cronyism for most of the 20th century— the topic was still considered off-limits by the governing regime (and the literary critics that sympathized with it) at the time of its publication.

Critically, the novel went on to receive the 1964 Casa de las Américas annual prize. It has also been distributed among Mexican public schools through the National Reading Program  and it was selected by the Guadalajara International Book Fair to celebrate the 2010 World Book Day.

Plot

Fictional Army General José Guadalupe "Lupe" Arroyo, a veteran of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, attempts to dispel all sorts of "defamatory claims" made by his political rivals and tries to explain the plainly incompetent political and military strategies devised by him and his associates.

Style

In the novel, Ibargüengoitia caricaturizes the solemn language and rhetoric frequently found in some autobiographical memoirs of the period.  Except in a few instances where the passage at hand is not controversial, most characters, cities, and even states are entirely fictional, as the author tried to avert a direct confrontation with members of the ruling party.

Publication

According to the author, he finished writing the novel in 1963 —some twenty years before his untimely death in a plane accident. The first edition consisted of 10,000 copies printed in May 1964 by Casa de las Américas in Havana, Cuba, celebrating its winning entry for best novel in its annual prize.  In Mexico, it was first available until May 1965 through Joaquín Mortiz; a publishing house acquired by Grupo Planeta in 1983. Most covers used by Planeta through both its Joaquín Mortiz and Booket imprints include a painting by his widow, British-born artist Joy Laville. 

As for its English edition, Ibargüengoitia negotiated a translation with Dr. Jack Robert in 1970 but, according to Víctor Díaz Arciniega, it was never completed. In 1986, Irene del Corral became the first official translator and her version was published by Bard/Avon Books (New York) under the title The Lightning of August. The same translation was adapted to British English and published in the United Kingdom by Chatto & Windus (1986).

In total, the novel has been translated into seven languages.
The First Lady of Colombia (First Lady of the Nation) is the title held by the hostess of the Casa de Nariño, usually the wife of the president of Colombia, concurrent with the president's term in office. Although the first lady's role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of Colombia.

Verónica Alcocer is the current first lady of Colombia, as wife of the 34th and current president of Colombia, Gustavo Petro.

The title of First Lady began to be used in 1934, and its first holder was María Michelsen Lombana, wife of President Alfonso López Pumarejo.

Current
Since August 2022 the first lady is Verónica Alcocer. At present, there are six living former first ladies: Nydia Quintero Turbay, ex-wife of Julio César Turbay Ayala; Ana Milena Muñoz de Gaviria, wife of César Gaviria; Jacquin Strouss Lucena, wife of Ernesto Samper; Nohra Puyana de Pastrana, wife of Andrés Pastrana; Lina Moreno de Uribe, wife of Álvaro Uribe; and María Clemencia Rodríguez de Santos, wife of Juan Manuel Santos; and María Juliana Ruiz, wife of Ivan Duque.

The spouse of the president of Colombia has up until now, always been a woman, and so have been most of the spouses of those who have run for office, with the most recent exception being Noemí Sanín Posada, a Conservative party presidential candidate in the 2002 and 2010 presidential elections, who although unmarried both times, her boyfriend, Javier Aguirre, was given a similar treatment by the media during the campaign as the wives of the rest of the candidates, noting that he would have been the first man to accompany a "presidentress" to the Casa de Nariño.

History

Upon the unequivocal declaration of independence of the consolidated territory of the former Viceroyalty of the New Granada at the Congress of Cúcuta and the ratification of the Constitution, Congress elected General Simón Bolívar Palacios as President of Colombia. Bolívar however, was a widower (his wife María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaysa died in 1803), had no children, his mother had died, and his sisters resided far away from the capital, leaving no female relations to fulfil any duties that would today be associated with that of the first lady. Bolívar did however, have a lover, Manuela Sáenz Aizpuru, a married woman who was the love of his life, and with whom he lived with despite the conservative views of his time. Therefore, Sáenz served as the unofficial hostess of the residence of Bolívar, the San Carlos Palace, as there was no official presidential palace at the time. Nevertheless, the extent of Sáenz's involvement in the Bolívar household was such that when political enemies of Bolívar broke into the house in an attempt to assassinate the president, she was there and dissuaded Bolívar from confronting his attackers and instead flee through window in their chambers, and although she was vilified during her lifetime, she is now considered a national hero.

Upon the resignation of Bolívar to the presidency in 1830, Congress elected Joaquín de Mosquera y Arboleda to succeed Bolívar as the 2nd president of Colombia. Mosquera was married to María Josefa Mosquera y Hurtado, his first cousin, who became the first person to be now considered as the official first lady of Colombia, that is, of what is now known as Gran Colombia. The first first lady of present-day Colombia was Soledad Román Polanco, the second wife of Rafael Núñez Moledo. Núñez first came to power in 1880 as President of what it was then known as the United States of Colombia, but when he moved to the capital, his wife Soledad Román stayed behind in their hometown of Cartagena, as their union was heavily criticized by the conservative society and media of the time for Núñez had legally divorced his first wife, María de los Dolores Gallegos Martínez, and married Román in a civil ceremony, but according to canon law they remained married in the eyes of God, and thus Núñez was accused of adultery and Román regarded as his mistress. Román eventually moved to Bogotá when the popularity of her husband rose to the point that most could overlook their union. When the Colombian Constitution of 1886 was ratified, present day Colombia was formed, with Núñez as the 1st president of Colombia, and Román as the 1st first lady. The couple were eventually able to marry through the Church when Gallegos, Núñez's first wife, died, allowing them to consecrate their already legal union through the Church and in the eyes of the conservative Catholic society. Their wedding took place while Núñez was in office on 23 February 1889.

The use of the title "First Lady" originated in the United States, first mentioned in reference to Dolley Madison, it was later used in other forms until 1877 when it was used in print media to refer to Lucy Webb Hayes, wife of Rutherford B. Hayes. In Colombia, the title was first used in print media in 1833, when the magazine Cromos used it to refer to the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt as First Lady of the United States, by then the term was broadly used in the United States to refer to the wife of the president. The title was first adopted for Colombian use the following year, when on 8 August 1834 Cromos referred to María Michelsen Lombana as "First Lady of Colombia" during the inauguration of her husband, President Alfonso López Michelsen.

Role
The position of the first lady is unofficial, it is not an elected one, carries no official duties, and receives no salary. Nonetheless, first ladies have held a highly visible position in Colombian society. The role of the first lady has evolved over the years, but she is, first and foremost, the spouse of the president.

For much of history, the spouse of the president, as in the case of most women in Colombia, did not have any sort of real influence or recognition. According to the Constitutional Court of Colombia, the first lady holds the title of private citizen before the public administration, but it gives the first lady a further special role, as, being the spouse of the president, the first lady symbolically embodies, along with the president of the republic, the idea of national unity in accordance to Article 188 of the 1991 Colombian Constitution.

On 30 December 1968 Congress passed Law 75 of 1968 that created the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF); Article 58 stated that "The Presidency of the Institute shall be exercised by the wife of the President...". This was the first instance that legal responsibility was granted to the Office of the First Lady on a permanent basis. This was later modified by Article 25 of Law 7 of 1979 that changed the role of the first lady in the ICBF: "The board of directors will be presided by the spouse of the President". This resolved a conflict of authority between the similar offices of President (until then the first lady) and the general director; also of note was the modified terminology of wife to spouse, introducing the possibility of a future president to be a woman and her spouse to be a man. Law 7 of 1979 allowed the first lady to remain involved with the ICBF without any specific duties in an ad honorem capacity.

Sentence C-537 of 1993 of the Constitutional Court of Colombia, however, deemed Article 58 Law 7 of 1979 unconstitutional, because it violated the principle of equal opportunity to access positions in public service by creating unjustifiable prerequisites, such as being married to the president. The Court however, clarified that their sentence did not signify the marginalization of the first lady from political activity, and that she as wife of the president embodied the idea of national unity.

Since then, the first lady has continued to pursue, at her discretion, humanitarian causes in an ad honorem capacity. Over the course of the 20th century it became increasingly common for first ladies to select specific causes to promote, usually ones that are not politically divisive. María Teresa Londoño led the collection for donations during the Colombia–Peru War, María Michelsen Lombana championed orphans' rights and care, Lorenza Villegas Restrepo pioneered public for health care services, Bertha Hernández Fernández was a leader of the women's suffrage movement, Cecilia de la Fuente de Lleras campaigned for the creation of the Institute for Family Welfare, Cecilia Caballero Blanco campaigned for legislation that ended the legal discrimination based on the legitimacy of children and their parentage, Nydia Quintero Turbay focused on disaster relief and assistance, Ana Milena Muñoz Gómez promoted higher education and culture, and Lina María Moreno Mejía led national pregnancy prevention programs in adolescents and promoted sexual and reproductive health rights for women.

John Lanzel Kaul (1866–1931) was an American businessman.  He was involved in the timber industry and was a prominent figure in Birmingham, Alabama.

Kaul was born in St. Marys, Pennsylvania on October 9, 1866 to Andrew Kaul and Walburga (Lanzel) Kaul. He was a student at Rock Hill College in Baltimore, Maryland, and also took a business course at Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York.  When he was 19 years old, Mr. Kaul started work at his father's lumber company, and in 1888 put in charge of the operation of the hardwood mill of the company. In 1889 he moved to the south to locate a yellow pine tract for operation, and he settled in Hollins, Alabama in 1890. He later moved to Birmingham, where he served as the president of Kaul Lumber Company.

Kaul served as president of the Southern Pine Association and was a pioneer in the activities to assure conservation of the national timber supply. He worked with Gifford Pinchot, then United States Forester, to greatly reduce practices that wasted wood. He also belonged to the National Lumberman's Committee on Forestry and was chairman of the Southern Pine Forestry Committee.

Kaul was a consistent Democrat, but he did not seek public office that would have distracted from his lumber manufacturing and sales interests. He served in a national capacity as a member of the American Commission to study rural credits in Europe; as a member of the State Board of Forestry, and as chairman of the Park Commission of the City of Birmingham.

During World War I, Kaul served as a member of the Southern Pine War Service Committee of the War Industries Board, and was also chairman of the Birmingham and Jefferson County Victory Loan Committees.

Kaul was a member of the Concatenated Order of Hoo-Hoo.

In an article entitled "Parasite Kills Self", the Southern Worker newspaper said the following about Kaul's death: 
John Lanzel Kaul, capitalist, of Birmingham, Ala., killed himself after a spree at Atlantic City by jumping from a window. Kaul was one of the most vicious labor haters in the South, was always among the worst enemies of any attempt on the part of workers employed in his lumber industry to organize. Kaul was formerly the president of the Birmingham Chapter of the Red Cross, and engaged in other “patriotic” activities that were safe for him. The Birmingham plutes who head lynch mobs will miss their drunken friend.

Whereas radical newspapers slandered him, the Alabama State Commission of Forestry praised him for his "ability, energy and devotion to duty contributed greatly to the advancement of forestry...his public service, and splendid personal qualities were held in highest regard and esteem by the membership of this commission."

On May 10, 1939, Brenner was appointed by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia to the Municipal Court (8th D.) to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Murray Hearn to the City Court. In November 1939, he was defeated when running for a full term, and left the bench at the end of the year. In 1940, he ran in the 8th district for Congress but was defeated by Democrat Donald L. O'Toole. 

In July 1944, he was elected Chairman of the Liberal Party in Brooklyn. On September 27, 1948, he was appointed by Mayor William O'Dwyer as a City Magistrate.

He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1953 to 1969. In September 1960, he was nominated on the Liberal ticket for the New York Court of Appeals; but declined to run. 

At the end of 1969, he resigned from the bench due to ill health, and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He died on May 30, 1970, in Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, of heart disease.

Djawoto (Perfected Spelling: Jawoto; August 10, 1906 – September 24, 1992) was an Indonesian journalist and diplomat. He served as Indonesia's ambassador to China and Mongolia starting in 1964.

Teacher and journalist
Djawoto became part of the Indonesian nationalist movement through the Sarekat Islam, one of the first mass organizations of native Indonesians which was at its height in the 1910s and early 1920s. He started working as a teacher in 1927.  A friend of Sukarno, Djawoto joined the Indonesian Nationalist Party in 1927. After 15 years as a teacher, Djawoto changed career and became a journalist instead. He worked at the Antara news agency for a number of years and served as its chief editor from 1946 to 1964. In 1945 he was included in the Education Section of the Socialist Party at the founding congress of the party. He was a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee between 1945 and 1949.  His book Djurnalistik dalam praktek ('Journalism in Practice') was published in 1960. Djawoto was a leading figure in the Union of Indonesian Journalists (PWI).

Ambassador
In 1964 he was named ambassador to China and Mongolia by President Sukarno. He was one of six journalists that Sukarno appointed as ambassadors during the 1960s.

Life in exile
After the 30 September Movement coup attempt, rumored to have been sponsored by the Communist Party of Indonesia, and the resulting purge of persons considered communists which killed hundreds of thousands, the political situation in Indonesia became unstable. The once civil government became a military regime, and the country's political allegiances, previously supporting the East Bloc, became more friendly to the West. As a result, several hundred or thousand Indonesian leftists travelling abroad were unable to return to their homeland.

Djawoto, the ambassador to a communist country, remained in China and resigned his post, despite being recalled by the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the early morning of April 16, 1966, Djawoto held a press conference at which he declared that he was no longer the Indonesian ambassador. In April 1966 Djawoto was granted political asylum in China. The Indonesian government withdrew his passport. He became general secretary of the Beijing-based Afro-Asian Journalists Association.

Djawoto left China and emigrated to the Netherlands in 1981. Although he had not been a Communist Party member, Djawoto was not allowed to return to Indonesia.

FG Capital Management, Ltd. is an American investment management firm based in New York City that focuses on equity investments and debt restructuring in emerging markets. As part of its management of distressed assets, FG Capital investigates and exposes financial fraud by engaging politicians, governments, and international organizations to combat corruption.

FG Hemisphere Associates

FG Hemisphere Associates is a "special-purpose vehicle", managed by FG Capital, which purchases sovereign debt claims where countries rich in natural resources have too little revenue from these resources ending up in the national treasury. FG Hemisphere stated that "these countries were suffering from lack of proper management, not a lack of resources" while emphasizing "governance and transparency reforms will recapture this lost revenue for the public coffers."

Sovereign debt
FG Capital Management sued the Democratic Republic of the Congo for $100 million after acquiring debts owed to Energoinvest for $2.6 million. Former Bosnian prime minister, Nedzad Brankovic, approved the deal and was investigated on corruption charges during his stint at EnergoInvest. Bosnian Police reported that Brankovic acted illegally in selling the debt, which was owned by the country, but sold personally, and recommended he be charged. A court in the Jersey Islands ruled that the DRC must pay FG Capital the debt in full plus interest, a claim of $108.3 million. In 2012, the ruling was overturned by the Privy Council of England, which blocked FG Capital from collecting on the debt.

Amateur career 
Sugden began his fighting career at the age of 5, alongside his younger brother Regis (4yrs), under the guidance of his father and WKA Light Middleweight World Champion Dean Sugden. During his time as an amateur Sugden collected an impressive array of accolades and gained notable media coverage as a kickboxer and boxer, often referred to as "the best in the world" and even earning a place at the WOF Asian Intercontinental games after a personal invite from the President of the Philippines.

In April 2008 Sugden travelled to Bangkok, Thailand to compete in the International Martial Arts Games where he won a Gold medal "in clinical fashion" solidifying his nickname "2Slick".

Sugden won the IKF Junior Amateur FCR Lightweight World Title on 29 November 2009 in Rochester, Kent, England when he defeated Charlie Ward by unanimous decision, 45-50, 47-48, 46-50.

Green Language is the second studio album by Glaswegian producer Russell Whyte under the alias Rustie. The album, released on Warp on August 25, 2014, was announced with the track "Raptor" - first played by Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1 in June 2014. It features guest appearances from D Double E, Danny Brown, Gorgeous Children, and Redinho. The title of the album derives from "the language of the birds".

Production
Reflecting on Glass Swords in 2014, Whyte stated that he felt that he "“went kind of quite crazy on Glass Swords" and that he was "taking the piss with kitsch sounds and over-the-top silliness." Whyte stated that he wanted his next album Green Language to be different and "more serious". In between the release of Glass Swords and Green Language, Whyte scrapped an entire album's worth of material that he stated "didn't feel right as an album."

Release
Green Language was released on August 25, 2014.

Reception

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 69, indicating "generally favorable reviews", based on 25 reviews.

Tshepo Mokoena of The Guardian gave the album a rating of 4 stars out of 5, calling it "an exercise in variety that pushes the boundaries of what a synth-driven album can, and should, sound like". Stephen Carlick of Exclaim! opined that "There are great tracks on Green Language, but a lack of consistency stops it from being a great album."

Tom Lea of Fact commented on the album in 2015 that the album "divided listeners". Whyte tweeted that he felt the Green Language was "too A&Red", later explaining that his managers were "trying to push me in one way, in kind of an avant garde, arty route, then I had other people trying to get me to do big singles, the vocal stuff and all that. I was getting pulled in two directions, which I think you can tell a little bit on the album."

Complex named the cover of Green Language as one of the 30 best album covers of 2014, while Pitchfork named it as one of the 20 best album covers of 2014.

He has also written the novels Faint Hope (누망), Nakta (낙타 The Camel), Eunhaengnamu sonyeon (은행나무 소년 The Ginkgo Tree Boy), as well as the children’s novel Dolgorae pachino (돌고래 파치노 Pachino the Dolphin).

Jeong won the 17th Danjae Literary Award for Faint Hope, the 25th Yosan Literary Prize for Brier Rose, and the 7th Beautiful Writer’s Award.

Life
Jeong Do-sang was born on January 3, 1960 in Macheon-myeon, Hamyang-gun, Gyeongsanngnam-do, South Korea. His father died when he was six. He moved to Seoul in 1971 and pursued studies while he worked various jobs such as a street peddler selling chewing gum, a newspaper boy, and taking on manual labor. He enrolled at the Department of German Language and Literature at Jeonbuk National University in 1981.

Jeong was imprisoned for his role in the Protest Against the Construction of the Peace Dam in 1986. In 1987, while serving his sentence in Jeonju Prison, he decided to begin writing. When he was released from prison, he worked at apartment construction sites while writing.  Jeong won the Chonnam National University’s May Literature Award for his short story Our Winter (우리들의 겨울). Afterwards, he actively pursued his career as a writer.

In 2005, Jeong's fifteen-year-old son committed suicide. His son's suicide gave Jeong Do-sang great shock, and caused a literary change within him. These experiences were presumably deeply related to his later constant interest in the youth problem as well as his publication of young adult novels and children's books.

Writing

As a Realist writer, Jeong lays out themes based on life experiences in his writing. His early works have realistic insights into how the state uses its great authority to destroy the lives of individuals. Particularly, in Chinguneun meolli gatsseodo (친구는 멀리 갔어도 Even though my friend went far), he portrays how a soldier that accidentally kills a superior officer becomes involved in a fabricated defection to North Korea, as well as a reforestation project. Jeong also realistically portrays violence within the military, making it an early representative work that widely spread his name among readers.

In terms of works after the 2000s, Jeong  focused his literary interest on nomadism and the problem of refugees. Brier Rose (찔레꽃), a serialized novel, is about North Korean defectors and their journey, telling the process of escape and settlement. It realistically portrays the issue of division concerning South Korean society.

In the 2010 novel Nakta (낙타 The Camel), Jeong  portrays the inner side of a protagonist. The protagonist faces inner loneliness via a journey through the Gobi Desert with his son, who passed away with only a short note. Nakta (낙타 The Camel) portrays how such scars of the protagonist are healed through friendships made with many people he meets during his travel.

In cryptography, format-transforming encryption (FTE) refers to encryption where the format of the input plaintext and output ciphertext are configurable. Descriptions of formats can vary, but are typically compact set descriptors, such as a regular expression.

Format-transforming encryption is closely related to, and a generalization of, format-preserving encryption.

Applications of FTE

Restricted fields or formats 

Similar to format-preserving encryption, FTE can be used to control the format of ciphertexts. The canonical example is a credit card number, such as 1234567812345670 (16 bytes long, digits only).
However, FTE does not enforce that the input format must be the same as the output format.

Censorship circumvention 

FTE is used by the Tor Project to circumvent deep packet inspection by pretending to be some other protocols. The implementation is ; it was written by the authors who came up with the FTE concept.

The Men's 10 metre platform diving event is one of 261 events in 17 disciplines at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. It was held on August 2, 2014. Tom Daley of England won the gold medal, Ooi Tze Liang of Malaysia won the silver medal and Vincent Riendeau of Canada won the Bronze madal.

Schedule
All times are British Summer Time (UTC+1)

Format
The divers were to compete in a preliminary round, with each diver making six dives. The 12 best divers were to advance to the final round during the evening session, where all previous scores would be cleared. However, since there were only 11 divers in the competition all the divers progressed to the final, with the preliminary round only serving to determine the order in which they dived in the final.

"Time of Our Lives" is a 2014 single by Moroccan singer Chawki (full name Ahmed Chawki) released in time with the launch of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. An Arabic language version retitled "Farhat al 'Aalam" (in Arabic فرحة العالم) was also released for the Arab World. It was produced by RedOne and released on RedOne Records.

Background
The various language song was released in partnership with BeIn Sports, the football (soccer) themed song came almost simultaneously with the immense commercial success of "Magic in the Air" by the Ivory Coast band Magic System featuring Chawki.

The song "Time of Our Lives" is in English language but as the release was targeted mainly for the French-speaking markets where Chawki had already had a previous hit with "Habibi I Love You", the song presented a bilingual refrain: "Allez, Allez, here we go, allez / This is the time of our lives) allez being French for "come on" used throughout the song.

A football and Brazilian Capoeira-themed outdoor partying video was also promoted in time for the opening of the 2014 World Cup.

The song found commercial success reaching number 15 in SNEP the official French official Singles Chart and went on high rotation on French commercial radio giving Chawki two simultaneous hit singles in France's Top 20, "Time of Our Lives" alongside "Magic in the Air" that reached number 3 in French main chart and number 1 in French Club 40 dance chart.

Language versions
A more extensively French language version was offered under the title "Time of Our Lives (Notre Moment)".

An Arabic language version of the song destined for Arab markets was retitled "Farhat al 'Aalam" (in Arabic فرحة العالم meaning the joy of the world), actually a trilingual version in Arabic (main lyrics) and English and French (refrains).

Make-A-Wish Foundation UK ("Make-A-Wish UK") is a UK-based charity founded in 1986. The charity grants wishes to children and young people fighting life-threatening conditions, and is affiliated to Make-A-Wish Foundation International.

History 

Make-A-Wish UK was founded in 1986, inspired by the story of Chris Greicius – a young boy fighting leukaemia in America. The first wish to be granted in the UK was for Anthony in Liverpool, who wished to meet Disney characters at Disney World in Florida. After four years, the charity had granted 100 wishes.

Make-A-Wish UK granted its 10,000th wish in 2015, to a boy called Ben – who wished to be a chef for the day after he was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was 5 years old.
In June 2019, Make-A-Wish UK has now granted over 13,000 wishes.

Wishes 

A wish is a special experience for a child or young person fighting a life-threatening condition. Wishes can range from being a princess or being a business owner for the day or meeting a hero, to going on a once-in-a-lifetime family holiday.

To receive a wish, a child must be between the ages of 3 and 17 years, living in the UK, and fighting a life-threatening condition. Make-A-Wish UK contacts each child's medical consultant to establish medical eligibility.

Make-A-Wish UK surveys the families of children who have received wishes, to evaluate the impact that wishes have on wish children and their families. In the charity's 2014 survey:

 91% of respondents said that the wish gave their family a greater sense of closeness.
 87% said the wish added to the child's quality of life.
 39% reported that the wish reduced the child's suffering from physical symptoms.

Celebrity supporters 

Make-A-Wish UK has a number of celebrity supporters, who back the charity through helping grant wishes and supporting fundraising initiatives.

Manly War Memorial is a heritage-listed memorial at 184 Carlton Terrace, Manly, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1920 to 1921. It is also known as Ferguson Street Reserve, Manly Dam, and Soldiers Memorial Park. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.

History 

The Manly War Memorial was unveiled by Walter Henry Barnes, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, on 5 March 1921. It is not known who designed the memorial, or who the mason was. The memorial, originally of Helidon brown freestone on a base of Enoggera granite, with a statue of Carrara marble, honours the 16 local men who fell during the First World War.

The land on which the park is located was originally part of a  lot bought by Thomas Jones in 1860. In 1882 the land was sold to the Arnold brothers who sub divided the land for auction. From the late 1890s the area was designated as a water reserve and eventually formed part of the Manly Dam, filled in some time after 1908. The land was never developed and was subsequently divided by a road. The memorial was erected around 1920, however the land, which had always been considered a park, was not officially resumed until 1937.

Previously known as Manly Memorial Park, it was renamed in 1990 after Richard Russell, pioneer Manly citizen and businessman who was elected mayor in 1919.

The Manly digger statue was plagued by acts of vandalism over the years, which culminated in 1992 in the statue being pulled from the pedestal and the head broken off. The statue was replaced with a concrete replica in 2007, but the original Italian marble statue, thought lost, was rediscovered in a Brisbane City Council depot in Lota in 2013.

Significance of war memorials in Australia

Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation.

Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word "cenotaph", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means "empty tomb".

Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit.

Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the digger statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects.

Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair.

Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, embodying the ANZAC spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity. The digger was a phenomenon peculiar to Queensland, perhaps due to the fact that other states had followed Britain's lead and established Advisory Boards made up of architects and artists, prior to the erection of war memorials. The digger statue was not highly regarded by artists and architects who were involved in the design of relatively few Queensland memorials.

Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were by artists or imported. They varied slightly in design, presumably to suit the needs of the communities who commissioned them.

Description 

The First World War Memorial is situated in a small park at the end of the main shopping street of Manly. It sits in a constructed oval-shaped amphitheatre within the park which comprises a formal arrangement of paths, garden seats, hedges and mature trees.

The memorial is surrounded by kerbing with bollards at each corner which are square in plan with pyramidal apexes. It sits on a circular concrete pad with kerbing to the outside edge.

The pedestal sits on a rock faced granite base with a chamfered top. It is of simple design and constructed of sandstone which has been painted.

The plinth has a smooth faced step surmounted by a simple moulding and another smooth faced step. This is capped by a small cornice. The dado has a small base step and the shaft has slightly tapering sides. The front face displays a marble plaque with the leaded names of the local men who fell in the First World War and the word MANLY is incised on the lower step. The western face also displays a marble plaque with the leaded names of the local men who fell in the Second World War.

The pedestal dado is capped by a simple concave cornice.

Chlorodiisopropylphosphine is an organophosphorus compound with the formula [(CH3)2CH]2PCl. It is a colorless liquid that reacts with water and oxygen. The compound is used to prepare tertiary phosphines  and phosphinite ligands.

Synthesis and reactions
The compound is prepared by treating phosphorus trichloride with the Grignard reagent isopropylmagnesium chloride:
PCl3  +  2 (CH3)2CHMgCl   →   [(CH3)2CH]2PCl  +  2 MgCl2
Relative to the reaction of less hindered Grignard reagents with PCl3, this reaction affords a superior yield of the monochloro derivative.

Chlorodiisopropylphosphine reacts with Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds to give phosphines:
 [(CH3)2CH]2PCl  +  RM   →    [(CH3)2CH]2PR  +  MCl

Chlorodiisopropylphosphine reacts with alcohols and phenols to give phosphinites, this reaction typically is conducted in the presence of a base:
 [(CH3)2CH]2PCl  +  ROH   →    [(CH3)2CH]2POR  +  HCl
Phosphinites are versatile ligands.

William Gagan (born in 1981) is an American photojournalist from San Francisco, California. He attended Redwood High School (Larkspur, California) and graduated in 1999. He then went on to pursue a bachelor's degree in communications at Dominican University of California which he received in 2003. In September 2011 he joined the Occupy Wall Street movement as a live streamer and journalist embedded within the movement. He made his entrance into the public spotlight when he snuck into Syria over the border of Turkey on a fact-finding mission in early 2012. Despite his success crossing into Syria and traveling with the Free Syrian Army he received much criticism and praise alike for his mission. Gagan primarily reports using social media and technology, but has since moved to photography and videography working for organizations such as Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2012–13 as a member of Operation Zero Tolerance, filming the TV show Whale Wars for Animal Planet. In 2014 he travelled to Southeast Asia where he worked as a freelance photographer on the island of Koh Tao. After returning to Portland, Oregon in May 2015 he started working as a stringer for Thomson Reuters and Willamette Week. His photos of the Trump election riots in Portland were published in such places as The Wall Street Journal and internationally in The Telegraph. He continues to work as a photojournalist in Portland most recently for Willamette Week documenting ANTIFA and Patriot Prayer rallies.
Eremon mycerinoides is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It was described by Thomson in 1864.
Electrovite is manufactured by Dominion Veterinary Laboratories (DVL) Inc., based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The company is Western Canada's largest manufacturer and distributor of veterinary pharmaceuticals, and describes itself as a family business. DVL has export ties to Trinidad, the Middle East and South Korea and was a 1999 Canada Export Award recipient.

Electrovite is a powder designed to alleviate physiological stress in cattle. It contains 8 vitamins: A, D3, E, B6, B12, folic acid (B9), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), along with a vitamin K derivative, menadione sodium bisulfite DVL adds these vitamins to an electrolyte premix that has 7 mineral salts: magnesium acetate, sodium acetate, calcium acetate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride and sodium diacetate. DVL packages the product in 300 gram packs, sold for $5.31.

Besides labor costs, the only cost consideration in the manufacture of the vitamins and salts is the prices of the raw chemicals. These raw materials include lemongrass oil, m-Cresol and ethyl acetylacetate.

Electrolyte Balance in Cattle

Electrolytes for cattle are part of a nutritional component known as the dietary electrolyte balance. Most causes of stress manifest as an imbalance of some kind in cattle's fluid stability. Electrolyte supplementation, as done with Electrovite, assists in maintaining electrolyte balance, and reduces the need for energy expenditure on the part of the animal to restore/self-regulate this balance. Besides the potential of electrolyte and vitamin solutions to alleviate stress, these additives may directly boost production. Even under stress conditions, supplementing diets with salts can stimulate feed intake. Hence, Electrovite would alleviate physiological stress and provide a boost to milk production.

The economics of digitization is the field of economics that studies how digitization, digitalisation and digital transformation affects markets and how digital data can be used to study economics. Digitization is the process by which technology lowers the costs of storing, sharing, and analyzing data. This has changed how consumers behave, how industrial activity is organized, and how governments operate. The economics of digitization exists as a distinct field of economics for two reasons. First, new economic models are needed because many traditional assumptions about information no longer hold in a digitized world. Second, the new types of data generated by digitization require new methods for their analysis.

Research in the economics of digitization touches on several fields of economics including industrial organization, labor economics, and intellectual property. Consequently, many of the contributions to the economics of digitization have also found an intellectual home in these fields. An underlying theme in much of the work in the field is that existing government regulation of copyright, security, and antitrust is inappropriate in the modern world. For example, information goods, such as news articles and movies, now have zero marginal costs of production and sharing. This has made the redistribution without permission common and has increased competition between providers of information goods. Research in the economics of digitization studies how policy should adapt in response to these changes.

Information technology and access to networks

Technological standards 

The Internet is a multi-layered network which is operated by a variety of participants. The Internet has come to mean a combination of standards, networks, and web applications (such as streaming and file-sharing), among other components, that have accumulated around networking technology. The emergence of the Internet coincided with the growth of a new type of organizational structure, the standards committee. Standards committees are responsible for designing critical standards for the Internet such as TCP/IP, HTML, and CSS. These committees are composed of representatives from firms, academia, and non-profit organizations. Their goal is to make decisions that advance technology while retaining interoperability between Internet components. Economists are interested in how these organizational structures make decisions and whether those decisions are optimal.

The supply of Internet access 

The commercial supply of Internet access began when the National Science Foundation removed restrictions for using the Internet for commercial purposes. During the 90's internet access was provided by numerous regional and national Internet service providers (ISPs). However, by 2014, the provision of high-speed broadband access was consolidated. About 80% of Americans can only buy 25Mbit/s from one provider and a majority only have a choice of two providers for 10Mbit/s service. Economists are particularly interested by competition and network effects within this industry. Furthermore, the availability of broadband may affect other economic outcomes such as the relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers.

Demand for the Internet 

A key issue in the economics of digitization is the economic value of Internet-based services. The motivation for this question is two-fold. First, economists are interested in understanding digitization related policies such as network infrastructure investment and subsidies for Internet access. Second, economists want to measure the gains to consumers from the Internet. The revenues of Internet Service Providers provided one direct measure of the growth in the Internet economy. This is an important topic because many economists believe that traditional measures of economic growth, such as GDP, understate the true benefits of improving technology. The modern digital economy also tends to lead to reliance on inputs with zero price.

The effects of digitization on industrial organization

Platforms and online marketplaces 

Digitization has coincided with the increased prominence of platforms and marketplaces that connect diverse agents in social and economic activity. A platform is defined by Bresnahan and Greenstein (1999) as "a reconfigurable base of compatible components on which users build applications". Platforms are most readily identified with their technical standards, i.e., engineering specifications for hardware and standards for software. The pricing and product strategies that platforms use differ from those of traditional firms because of the presence of network effects. Network effects arise within platforms because participation by one group affects the utility of another group. Many online platforms replicate identical process or algorithms at virtually no cost, allowing them to scale the network effect without encountering diminishing returns. Large scale network effects make the analysis of competition between platforms more complex than the analysis of competition between traditional firms. Much work in the economics of digitization studies the question of how these firms should operate and how they compete with each other. A particularly important issue is whether markets for online platforms have a tendency towards "winner-takes-all" competitive outcomes, and should be subject to antitrust actions.

Online platforms often drastically reduce transactions costs, especially in markets where the quality of a good or trading partner is uncertain. For example, eBay drastically increased the market for used consumer goods by offering a search engine, reputation system, and other services that make trade less risky. Other online marketplaces of this type include Airbnb for accommodations, Prosper for lending, and Odesk for labor. Economists are interested in quantifying the gains from these marketplaces and studying how they should be designed. For example, eBay, Odesk, and other marketplaces have adapted the use of auctions as a selling mechanisms. This has prompted a large literature on the comparative advantages of selling goods via auction versus using a fixed price.

User-generated content and open source production 

Digitization has coincided with the production of software and content by users who are not directly compensated for their work. Furthermore, those goods are typically distributed for free on the Internet. Prominent examples of open-source software include the Apache HTTP Server, Mozilla Firefox, and the Linux operating system. Economists are interested in the incentives of users to produce this software and how this software either substitutes or complements existing production processes. Another area of study is estimating the degree to which GDP and other measures of economic activity are mis-measured due to open source software. For example, Greenstein and Nagle (2014) estimate that Apache alone accounts for a mis-measurement between $2 billion and $12 billion.

In addition, open source production can be used for hardware, known as open hardware, normally by sharing digital designs such as CAD files. Sharing of open hardware designs can generate significant value because of the ability to digitally replicate products for approximately the cost of materials using technologies such as 3D printers.

Another active area of research studies the incentives to produce user-generated content such as Wikipedia articles, digital videos, blogs, podcasts, etc. For example, Zhang and Zhu (2011) show that Wikipedia contributors are motivated by the social interaction with other contributors. Greenstein and Zhu (2012) show that while many Wikipedia articles exhibit slant, the overall level of slant across articles on Wikipedia has diminished over time.

Advertising 
Advertising is an important source of revenue for information goods, both online and offline. Given the prevalence of advertising-supported information goods online, it is important to understand how online advertising works. Economists have spent much effort in trying to quantify the returns to online advertising. One especially interesting aspect of online advertising is its ability to target customers using fine demographic and behavioral data. This ability potentially affects the ability of new and small firms to gain exposure to customers and to grow. Targeted advertising is controversial because it sometimes uses private data about individuals obtained through third-party sources. Quantifying the costs and benefits of using this type of data is an active research area in the field.

The effects of digitization on consumer choice

Search, search engines and recommendation systems 

Perhaps the oldest and largest stream of research on the Internet and market frictions emphasizes reduced search costs. This literature builds on an older theory literature in economics that examines how search costs affect prices. Digitization of retail and marketing meant that consumers could easily compare prices across stores, so the empirical work on Internet pricing examined the impact on prices and price dispersion. Initially hypothesized by Bakos (1997), the first wave of this research empirically documented lower prices, but still substantial dispersion.

The newest wave of this research collects data about online searches to examine the actual search process that consumers undertake when looking for a product online. This question also emphasizes that the final stage of purchase is often controlled by a more familiar retail environment, and it raises questions about the growing importance of standards and platforms in the distribution of creative content.

As noted earlier, near-zero marginal costs of distribution for information goods might change where and how information goods get consumed. Geographic boundaries might be less important if information can travel long distances for free. One open question concerns the incidence of the impact of low distribution costs. The benefits might vary by location, with locations with fewer offline options generating a larger benefit from digitization.

Furthermore, online retailers of digital goods can carry many more products and never worry about running out of inventory. Even if a song only sells a handful of times, it is still profitable to be offered for sale on the Internet. At the same time, the zero marginal costs of distribution mean that top-selling (superstar) items never go out of stock and therefore can achieve even higher sales (Anderson, 2006). Several papers in the literature attempt to quantify the economic impact of increased product variety made available through electronic markets. Bar-Isaac et al. (2012) derive a theory of when lower search costs will result in 'superstar' and 'long-tail' effects.

Reputation systems 

One particularly important aspect of digitization for consumers is the increased use of reputation systems on retail websites and online marketplaces. Sixty-eight percent of respondents in a 2013 Nielsen survey said that they trusted online reviews. Numerous papers have shown that these review systems affect consumer demand for restaurants books, and hotels. A key area of research in digitization studies whether online reputations accurately reveal both the vertical and horizontal quality of a good. For example, Forman et al. (2008) show that local reviews have more effect than reviews from distant reviewers, suggesting that reviews provide information about both vertical and horizontal differentiation. On the other hand, several show that online review are biased because not everyone leaves reviews, because reviewers are afraid of retaliation, and because sellers may promote their own products using the review system. Newer research proposes designs for reputation systems that more efficiently aggregate information about the experiences of users.

The effects of digitization on labor markets 

Digitization has partially or fully replaced many tasks that were previously done by human laborers. At the same time, computers have made some workers much more productive. Economists are interested in understanding how these two forces interact in determining labor market outcomes. For example, a large literature studies the magnitude and causes of skill-biased technical change, the process by which technology improves wages for educated workers. Alternatively,  (2014) describes a framework for classifying jobs into those more or less prone to replacement by computers. Furthermore, the use of information technology only increases productivity when it's complemented by organization changes. For example, Garicano and Heation (2010) show that IT increases the productivity of police departments only when those police departments increased training and expanded support personnel.  Work by Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2002)  found evidence of organizational complementarities with information technology and boosted the demand for skilled labor.

Another consequence of digitization is that it has drastically reduced the costs of communication between workers across different organizations and locations. This has led to a change in the geographic and contractual organization of production. Economists are interested in the magnitude of this change and its effect on local labor markets. A recent study found that the potential of manufacturing sector jobs to be offshored did not reduce wages in the US. However, survey evidence suggests that 25% of American jobs are potentially offshorable in the future.

Online labor market platforms like Odesk and Amazon Mechanical Turk represent a particularly interesting form of labor production arising out of digitization. Economists who study these platforms are interested in how they compete with or complement more traditional firms. Another active area of research is how to incentivize workers on these platforms to produce more efficiently. While workers engaged in routine, lower-skill tasks such as data entry are particularly susceptible to competition from online labor markets, creative professions are also exposed, as many online platforms now provide opportunities to crowdsource creative work.

Government policy and digitization

Intellectual property and digitization 

One main area of policy interest related to digitization concerns intellectual property. The justification for giving copyright and patent right relies on the theory that the potential to gain these rights encourages the production and sharing of intellectual property. However, digitization and ease of copying has made it difficult to defend intellectual property rights, especially in the case of copyright. Varian (2005) supplies a theoretical framework for thinking about this change from an economics perspective. Usually, the economic effect on copyright-holders in the context of free copying is considered to be negative. However, Varian suggests an important counter-argument. If the value a consumer puts on the right to copy is greater than the reduction in sales, a seller can increase profits by allowing that right. Varian also provides a detailed description of several business models which potentially address the greater difficulty of enforcing copyrights as digitization increases. Alternative business models for intellectual property holders include selling complementary goods, subscriptions, personalization, and advertising.

Empirical research in this area studies the effects of Internet file-sharing on the supply and demand for paid content. For example, Danaher et al. 2010 show that the removal of NBC content from iTunes increased the illicit copying of NBC shows by 11.4%. This result shows that licensed and unlicensed content are substitutes. Giorcelli and Moser (2014) show that the spread of copyright in Italy between 1770 and 1900 increased the production of new and better operas. Still, there is little work on how these empirical results should inform copyright rules and security practices.

Net neutrality

Privacy, security, and digitization 

Privacy and data security is an area where digitization has substantially changed the costs and benefits to various economic actors. Traditional policies regarding privacy circumscribed the ability of government agencies to access individual data. However, the large-scale ability of firms to collect, parse, and analyze detailed micro-level data about consumers has shifted the policy focus. Now, the concern is whether firms' access consumer data should be regulation and restricted. In the past decade, theoretical work on commercial privacy has tended to focus on behavioral price discrimination as being a potential application of a context where researchers can model privacy concerns from an economics perspective.

Goldfarb and Tucker (2011a) wrote the first paper to empirically study the economic effects of privacy regulation for the advertising-supported Internet. The implementation of privacy regulation in Europe has made it more difficult for firms to collect and use consumer browsing data to target their ads more accurately; the field test data shows these policies are associated with a 65 percent reduction in the influence banner ads have on purchase intent. As well as this main effect, their research also suggests that privacy regulation might change the web landscape in unanticipated ways, with advertising becoming even more intrusive. It also might lead marketers to shift their media buys away from newspapers because of difficulties in finding relevant advertising to show.

Another related concern is what precautions should firms take to prevent data breaches such as those at Target and Staples. Arora et al. (2010) models the firm's effort in securing data from an economics perspective. They find that direct competition reduces the time that a firm takes to patch a vulnerability to its software. Other attempts at measuring the consequences of information security policy from an economics perspective are Miller and Tucker (2011), who look at policies mandating encryption, and Romanosky et al. (2011), who look at mandatory breach notification laws.

Other issues 

There are many other policies related to digitization that are of interest to economists. For example, digitization may affect government effectiveness and accountability. Digitization also makes it easier for firms in one jurisdiction to supply consumers in another. This creates challenges for tax enforcement. Another issue is that companies with new, Internet based business models, such as Airbnb and Uber, pose challenges for regulation aimed at traditional service providers. Many safety and quality enforcement regulations may no longer be necessary with the advent of online reputation systems. Lastly, digitization is of great importance to health care policy. For example, electronic medical records have the potential to make healthcare more effective but pose challenges to privacy policy.

Books 

In May 2015 the National Bureau of Economic Research published a book with University of Chicago Press entitled "Economic Analysis of the Digital Economy." The editors for the book are Avi Goldfarb, Shane Greenstein, and Catherine Tucker. The volume brings together leading scholars to explore this emerging area of research. This follows on a book that collected twenty-five important articles in the area, published by Edward Elgar Publishing, titled "Economics of Digitization."

Yellow-cedar decline is the accelerated decline and mortality of yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) occurring in the Pacific Northwest Temperate Rainforest of Southeast Alaska and British Columbia in North America. This phenomenon has been observed on over 200,000 hectares of forest and is believed to be due to reduced winter snowpacks and increased soil freezing.

Setting
Yellow cedar ranges from the Klamath Mountains of California to Prince William Sound in Alaska. Limited to higher elevations throughout most of its natural range   The climate in Southeast Alaska and western British Columbia is hyper-maritime, with frequent low-intensity precipitation. Snow levels in this area are highly variable due to near freezing temperatures in the winter time. Forests here are dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea stichensis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), shore pine (Pinus contorta), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and yellow cedar. Decline of this species has affected over 200,000 hectares of forest in Alaska and 50,000 hectares in British Columbia, approximately 8% of the species range

Causes
It is currently generally accepted that increased regional temperature and associated reduction in snow-pack depth and duration are some of the drivers behind yellow-cedar decline. However, other causes of decline are being investigated by researchers. Current evidence suggests that yellow-cedar decline is not biologically driven or caused by direct anthropogenic pollution or atmospheric pollution. Researchers have investigated the effects of soil saturation and soil chemistry on yellow-cedar decline and have yet to reveal any conclusive data, other than the fact that these parameters may indirectly influence cedar mortality. Elevation also seems to play a role in cedar decline, as it was found in one study that yellow cedar trees growing above 130 meters were more cold hardy than those growing below 130 meters.

Freezing injury
Yellow-cedar decline began in about 1880 which coincides with a warming of the climate after the Little Ice Age. The mechanics of this process are still hypothetical, but evidence suggests that soil exposure to cold temperatures due to lack of canopy cover or wetness of soils can lead to freezing injury of yellow cedar. Open canopy conditions in the forest expose soils to freezing temperatures. As regional temperatures warm, precipitation falls as rain more often than snow in the winter. Snow packs in the winter offer some insulation to root systems from freezing, the absence of this snow pack allows for soil freezing. As soils freeze, root tissues, especially those in wet soils, suffer damage and can lead to tree mortality. Yellow cedar is found to be significantly less cold hardy than tree species surrounding it, such as the western hemlock, which was found to deharden at almost 13 °C less than the yellow cedar in comparable conditions.

Management and conservation
Management and conservation of yellow cedar in light of its declining state could be divided into three management areas: the maladapted, the persistent, and migration. Maladapted being those areas in which yellow cedar will lose in competition with resident and exotic species. Persistent being those ecosystems in which yellow cedar has managed to compete with resident species that will require special attention for maintenance. And migration being those areas which are suitable, but do not presently contain yellow-cedar populations.

Maladapted
It is very important to recognize that conservation and restoration in areas that are maladapted for yellow cedar are futile. Areas that have already been maladapted for yellow cedar are important as sources of economic value. Dead regions of yellow cedar are still available for harvest even 80 years after death. Harvest of these areas represent a large opportunity for wood resources, shifting from logging of healthy yellow cedar in suitable habitat to those in maladapted regions could be beneficial to the conservation of this species. 
It seems that, following the decay of yellow cedar, western red cedar will succeed the dead forest. The red cedar offers many of the very same economic and ecological values as yellow cedar. Areas of lower elevation in Southeast Alaska and British Columbia that have seen yellow-cedar decay have been succeeded by red cedar. However, more research will need to take place as this problem persists to evaluate the economic and ecological value of subsidizing red cedar in these areas.

Persistent
Areas that are predicted with future climate change models to be suitable for sustained yellow-cedar habitation could be considered persistent from a management standpoint. It is important to accurately model these areas in order to develop effective management strategies. 
At a landscape level, areas with well-drained soils are most likely to host yellow cedar into the future. These are the areas that see the highest rates of production among trees in the Pacific Northwest temperate rainforest, and are thusly the areas that are targeted for timber harvest. For this reason, these areas are hotspots for active management of yellow cedar into the future, as they represent the main areas that are able to achieve conservation goals.

Migration
Some conservationists propose that assisted migration into areas uninhabited by yellow cedar will be an effective management strategy. Assisted migration is the introduction of species and genotypes into areas that are projected to be suitable for those species/genotypes. This can be controversial, mainly because it is seen as introducing invasive species into ecosystems, which could bring undesirable results. Researchers have attempted the introduction of yellow cedar in areas that it does not grow, but are within its range. A trial planting in Yakutat, Alaska, yielded first-year survival rates of over 90%, meaning that targeted migration can be used as an effective management strategy.
The Ansgar's Church was a church building in Vättersnäs in Jönköping, Sweden. It belonged to Mission Covenant Church of Sweden, which in October 2012 joined the Uniting Church in Sweden.

It was inaugurated on 17 October 1965. On the night before Tuesday, 3 August 2021, the church was destroyed by a fire.

According to a police report published on 12 August the same year, the fire was caused following a lightning strike. This conclusion has later been questioned, as no thunder was recorded by the SMHI, and because of witnesses of firework explosions.

ReferencesEruption is a 2010 New Zealand docu-drama that follows days building up to a fictional Auckland volcanic eruption.

Plot
Scientist Clive de Roo (played by Mark Mitchinson) detects volcanic activity under Waitematā Harbour. As de Roo presents as a maverick, he is not being taken seriously by his colleagues and his calls for having the city evacuated fall on deaf ears. Eruption follows the reaction of several families to the increasing seismic activity that precedes volcanic eruptions, including de Roo's own family. His wife, Mere (played by Nicola Kawana), is one of the people who disagree with his concerns. After a few days, the volcano starts erupting without any organised evacuation having taken place, with de Roo filming from his home. As the eruption intensifies, de Roo says "These will be my final observations" before his home gets pelted by rocks.

Background
The 90-minute film was produced by Wellington production company Gibson Group and followed their award winning 2008 production Aftershock, which featured an earthquake that devastated and cut off the capital city. Both Aftershock and Eruption were by screenwriter Graeme Tetley, with the Auckland doco-drama one of his last works before his death in March 2011. Eruption was directed by Danny Mulheron and Dave Gibson was the producer. The movie's main character, scientist Clive de Roo, is played by Mitchinson. The leadup to the volcanic eruption is a realistic scenario informed by research undertaken by GNS Science and Civil Defence; Gibson estimated that Eruption is about 95 percent scientifically accurate. The film is based on the fact that the Auckland volcanic field is made up by dozens of volcanic cones, with the most recent eruption some 600 years ago forming Rangitoto Island.

Eruption aired on 13 October 2010 on TV3; this was timed to fall into the Civil Defence awareness week which went from 10 to 16 October 2010 and was dubbed "Get ready week". This was one month after the initial Christchurch earthquake where a New Zealand population experienced a natural disaster. Gibson hoped that it would not be "too much too soon" for people from Christchurch. The film was The New Zealand Herald's "TV pick of the week".

Kostas Bakoyannis (born 16 March 1978) is a Greek politician. Having served as mayor of the town of Karpenisi, he was popularly elected Regional governor of Central Greece in the 2014 local elections. In June 2019, he was elected as the new Mayor of Athens starting from 1 September 2019.

Early life and education
Born 1978 in Athens to New Democracy politicians Dora and Pavlos Bakoyannis, Kostas Bakoyannis lost his father Pavlos in 1989, when he was assassinated by the leftist terrorist group,  Revolutionary Organization 17 November. He studied history and International Relations at Brown University and graduated from Harvard with a Master of Public Administration. He holds a PhD thesis at St Antony's College, Oxford, in the field of Political Science and International Relations. 
He speaks English and German. Kostas Bakoyannis’ articles are often published in the Greek and foreign press.

His uncle is the current Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and his maternal grandfather was the former prime minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis.

Career

Mayor of Karpenisi
In August 2010, Bakoyannis announced to run for mayoral office as an independent candidate in the small town of Karpenisi in Evrytania, where his father had originally come from. New Democracy decided not to challenge Bakoyannis with a candidate of its own, though the party had expelled his mother Dora in May for voting in favor of the austerity measures proposed by the Papandreou government.

Kostas Bakoyannis won the local elections with 54.3%. In a To Vima interview he strongly defended the bailout deal stating that "where we have come to after all the crimes that the Greek political system made over the past 30 years, we had no choice but the Memorandum." He said that he wouldn't rule out joining the new Democratic Alliance party his mother had founded, and that "Greece needs suicidal governments ready to kill themselves to save the country."

Regional governor of Central Greece
During his third year as Mayor of Karpenisi, Bakoyannis decided to run for  the governorship of Central Greece, again as an independent. His decision to leave the Mayorship was initiated by a growing number of citizen’s voices  from the greater Central Greece area, not only Karpenisi, who saw the risks and the opportunities that were coming up ahead for their area in the next 5 year term of the new Governor, and wanted a results oriented, tested and tried candidate for the job.  He was however backed by New Democracy, which again nominated no  candidate of its own, and clearly won the 2014 regional election with 56.06% in the second round, defeating Syriza's candidate Evangelos Apostolou.

Mayor of Athens
Bakoyannis was elected Mayor of Athens after the local elections of 2019 and took office on 1 September 2019.

Other activities

Personal life
He has four children, Pavlos, Olympia, Danai and Dimos.

Għargħar Battery, also known as Ta' Ittuila Battery and Ta' Xindi Battery, was an artillery battery in present-day San Ġwann, Malta, built by Maltese insurgents during the French blockade of 1798–1800. It was part of a chain of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments encircling the French positions in Marsamxett Harbour and the Grand Harbour.

Location
Għargħar Battery was located in an area known as San Ġwann tal-Għargħar, which is now part of San Ġwann. It overlooked Gżira and Manoel Island, on which there was the French-occupied Fort Manoel.

Description
The battery had a linear gun platform and a high masonry parapet with six embrasures. The battery had flanking walls on either sides of the platform, and a high rubble wall at the rear. Sentry boxes were located in at least three of the four corners of the battery. Two of these were fitted with flagpoles flying the White Ensign and the flag of the Kingdom of Sicily. Għargħar Battery is significant as being the first place where the British flag was raised in Malta. The battery also had a vaulted underground casemate for the accommodation of the garrison.

History
The battery was built by Vincenzo Borg, and was completed by 6 October 1798. It was armed with five 18-pounder cannons, some of which were taken from Mistra Battery. The battery had an advanced post at Il-Ħarrub ta' Stiefnu, which was armed with a single gun. The battery's garrison consisted of 338 men in December 1799.

Għargħar Battery tried to fire on the capital Valletta, but it was too far away and the bombardment had little effect on it. The French attempted to attack the battery in 1799 but were driven back.

Għargħar Battery still existed in 1811, but like the other French blockade fortifications, it was dismantled, possibly after 1814. No traces of the battery can be seen today, and the area is now built up. According to Arnold Cassola, some remains still exist.

Ralph Andrew Knibbs is an English former rugby union player who played for Bristol.

Rugby career
He made his debut as a seventeen-year-old against Pontypridd RFC in 1982, scoring with his first touch of the ball. Knibbs had a repertoire of running angles and scored many individual tries in his Bristol career which lasted until 1996. He played in the 1983 cup final as an eighteen-year-old, and represented Gloucestershire in all their games in the 1982/83 championship-winning campaign. He was also an accomplished basketball player, athlete and American football player before his rugby career. He played for the South West Division, England under-23s, and the England Sevens.

He turned down the chance to go on the 1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa, because of his opposition to apartheid. He also declared himself unavailable for 1988 England rugby union tour of Australia and Fiji, due to work commitments, making him one of the only players ever to turn down England national rugby union team twice. Despite this, Knibbs made 436 appearances for Bristol, scoring 123 tries, and was vice-captain during the centenary season. He later captained Clifton Rugby Football Club where he ended his career.

On 18 February 2007 Knibbs was also named in The Sunday Times top 10 centres of time along with names such as Brian O'Driscoll and Simon Halliday by Bath rival Jeremy Guscott who described Knibbs as being "silky and absolutely superb" and whom admitted it was a "crying shame he never won an England cap".

On 22 March 2016 Knibbs was a victim of attempted murder by transgender fell runner Lauren Jeska. Knibbs was stabbed several times in the head and neck by Jeska in a "premeditated and savage attack" at Alexander Stadium, in Birmingham. This resulted in life-threatening injuries and Knibbs suffering a stroke. The attack occurred in the context of a planned review of Jeska's status as a female athlete because of the fact she had been born a man. Jeska admitted attempted murder and was jailed for 18 years.

Knibbs sustained long-term nerve damage from the attack and the life-saving surgery he underwent afterwards. The stroke he suffered caused sight loss in both eyes and temporarily blinded him in one eye. He also has limited movement and difficulty eating owing to the severed nerves and is disabled.

Muzaffar ibn Kaydar was a ninth-century governor of Egypt for the Abbasid Caliphate.

Career 
Muzaffar was initially appointed to head the security (shurtah) of Egypt by his father Kaydar Nasr ibn 'Abdallah, after the latter was made governor of the province in 832. Following the death of Kaydar in the spring of 834, however, Muzaffar assumed the governorship himself. He immediately moved to put down a revolt, led by Yahya ibn al-Wazir al-Jarawi, which had broken out during his father's lifetime, and defeated the rebels in a battle near Tinnis. Al-Jarawi was captured and his followers dispersed, putting an end to the uprising.

According to the Egyptian chronicler al-Kindi, Muzaffar was the first governor of Egypt to recite the takbir during the Friday prayers. His activities regarding the mihnah, then underway in the provinces of the caliphate, are subject to debate; Ibn Taghribirdi reported that he tested the ulama on the createdness of the Qur'an, but this may be a doublet of events that occurred during his father's governorship.

In the summer of 834, the Turkish general Ashinas was granted the oversight of Egypt by al-Mu'tasim, and his name was mentioned in the prayers throughout the province. Shortly after this, Muzaffar was dismissed as governor by Ashinas and replaced with Musa ibn Abi al-'Abbas. Following his dismissal, he departed from Egypt, and in 837 he is mentioned as an officer under al-Afshin during the war against Babak al-Khurrami.
Eli Izhakoff is an American businessman in the international diamond and jewelry industry, filling a variety of public positions since 1979.

Early career
A member of a family that pioneered the diamond industry both in the United States and Israel, he is a partner at J. Izhakoff & Sons, a diamond manufacturing and import/export firm, with offices in New York.

In 1979, he first joined the board of directors of the (Diamond Dealers Club), in New York, the largest diamond exchange in the United States, and in the years that followed held several senior positions, including chairman of the board and secretary. He was elected to serve as treasurer-general of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses, a global body that unites diamond exchanges around the world in 1986, and was appointed a member of its executive committee.

In January 1990, Izhakoff was elected president of the Diamond Dealers Club and conceived and formed the Diamond Industry Steering Committee, an umbrella organization of the four diamond trade associations in New York, and served as its first chairman.

World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB)
At the World Diamond Congress, which was held in May 1991 in London, England, Izhakoff was unanimously elected president of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB). He was unanimously re-elected for a second term at the following World Diamond Congress, which was held in Antwerp, Belgium, in June 1993. At the World Diamond Congress held in Tel Aviv, Israel, in May 1996, he was unanimously re-elected for a third term as WFDB president.

During his term as WFDB president his played an instrumental role the expansion of the federation, and oversaw the establishment of new diamond bourses in Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, China, Russia and India.

In June 1995, Izhakoff played a key role in the organization of an international diamond summit, attended by many industry leaders, which revealed for the first time to the world the scope of the Russian diamond industry. It began with a conference in Moscow, and continued with a tour of various mining sites in the Republic of Sakha, during which its president, Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev, presented awards of recognition to Izhakoff, Nicholas Oppenheimer and Gary Ralfe of De Beers, and Maurice Tempelsman of Lazare Kaplan International.

Upon completion of his third term as WFDB president at the World Diamond Congress in Bangkok, Thailand, in July 1998, he was unanimously elected as Honorary Life President of the WFDB.

World Diamond Council
Following the emergence of the conflict diamond crisis in Africa in the late 1990s, Izhakoff was requested by industry leaders to head a new organization that would coordinate efforts to end the trade in rough diamonds financing civil conflict. Called the World Diamond Council (WDC), it was established at the World Diamond Congress in Antwerp, Belgium, in July 2000, and he was unanimously elected as its founding president.

Over the three years that followed, Izhakoff worked together with government representatives from around the world and representatives of civil society, to create an international system that will regulate the flow of rough diamonds into the distribution pipeline, in order to eliminate the presence of merchandise from areas of civil conflict. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, of which he is considered an architect, was accepted an implemented in 2003, and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. It is recognized as having reduced the number of conflict diamonds in the pipeline from more than 4 percent of the total to less than one tenth of 1 percent.

In November 2006, Izhakoff, briefed G8 ministers in Moscow on the Kimberley Process and its success as a possible model to meet the challenges of global terror.

A critical achievement was recorded during the 7thWorld Diamond Council Annual Meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, in July 2010, when the Kimberley Process was able to reach consensus on an agreement that would enable the renewal of rough diamond exports from the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe, solving a crisis that threatened to paralyze the rough diamond trade.  Izhakoff had earlier invited the Kimberley Process to hold a mini-summit in St. Petersburg alongside the World Diamond Council, in a further attempt to reach agreement over Marange. As a result, a senior delegation from the government of Zimbabwe, including Minister of Mining Obert Moses Mpofu, and Zimbabwe's attorney general, Johanne Tomama, traveled to St. Petersburg for the meeting. So did a high-level delegation from the U.S. State Department led by Susan Page, Assistant U.S. Deputy Secretary of State.

Just prior to the WDC Annual Meeting in St. Petersburg, Zimbabwe had released from custody Farai Maguwu, a local human rights activist who it earlier had been accused of providing false information prejudicial to the state in connection with the Marange diamond fields. During the meeting, Izhakoff publicly called on the Zimbabwe attorney general to drop the still-pending charges against Mr. Maguwu, and this eventually happened in October. In book he later contributed to about the period, Maguwu credited Izhakoff for helping obtain his release from custody and convincing the Zimbabwe authorities to drop the charges against him.

When he stepped down as WDC President in 2013, he was elected Honorary Life President of the organization.

Panama
In 2014, Izhakoff was invited to assist in the development of a major project in the Republic of Panama, the goal of which was to establish the first dedicated diamond, colored gemstone and jewelry trading center in Latin America. Called the World Jewelry Hub, it also is the headquarters of Latin America's first recognized diamond bourse, the World Jewelry & Diamond Hub, Panama.

Recognition and awards
Izhakoff holds the titles of Honorary Chairman of the Diamond Industry Steering Committee, New York, USA; Honorary President of the Diamond Dealers Club, New York, USA; and Honorary Chairman of the Bangkok Diamonds and Precious Stones Exchange, Bangkok, Thailand.

At the CIBJO Congress in Vancouver, Canada, in 2006, Izhakoff was named an Honorary Life President of CIBJO, The World Jewellery Confederation.

He has received the Officer of the Order of Leopold from the King of Belgium, the Rapaport Award for Corporate Social Responsibility, the Israel Diamond Industry Dignitary Award, the New York Diamond Industry Lifetime Achievement Award, Diamantaire of the Year from the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB), the Medal of Honor from the Israel Diamond Institute, a special award from the Israel Diamond Exchange, the Andrea Palladio International Jewellery Award for Corporate and Social Responsibility, and special honors from the president of the Republic of Sakha, the government of Thailand, the government of South Africa and the Dubai Multi Commodities Center.

Melaleuca montis-zamia is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the Springsure district in Queensland, Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria use the name Callistemon montis-zamiae.) It is a shrub with red bottlebrush flowers.

Description
Melaleuca montis-zamia is a shrub growing to  tall. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are  long,  wide, flat, narrow elliptic to narrow egg-shaped with a mid-vein and 18 to 27 lateral veins.

The flowers are a shade of red with the stamens tipped with yellow. They are arranged in spikes on the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are  in diameter with 10 to 40 individual flowers. The petals are  long, hairy on the outer surface and fall off as the flower ages. There are 40 to 58 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs in August and September and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules,  long.

Taxonomy and naming
Melaleuca montis-zamiae was first formally described in 2009 by Lyndley Craven in Novon, but the spelling was in error, later corrected to M. montis-zamia. The specific epithet (montis-zamia) is from the Latin word mons meaning "a mountain" and Zamia, in reference to the habitat of this species at Mt. Zamia in the Minerva Hills National Park, Queensland.

Callistemon montis-zamiae is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca montis-zamia by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Craven noted that the spelling Melaleuca montis-zamiae in the Novon article is an error which was not detected at the proof stage.

Distribution and habitat
Melaleuca montis-zamia occurs in the Springsure district. It grows in scrub near watercourses.

The calceus (pl. calcei) was the common upper-class male footwear of the Roman Republic and Empire. Normally made of leather and hobnailed, it was flat soled and typically reached the lower shin, entirely covering the foot and ankle. It was secured with crossed thongs or laces. Equivalent to a short boot or high-top shoe, it was lighter than the military caliga but sturdier than slip-on shoes like the soccus and able to easily handle outdoor use.

Name
The Latin word  derives from  ("heel") and the usually Grecian suffix , meaning essentially "heely" or "thing for the heel". It is frequently taken loosely as the general Latin word for any laced and covered shoe distinguished from sandals, slippers, and boots. Theodor Mommsen even considered it to sometimes intend sandals as well. Similarly, medieval Latin used the adjective  indicate both mendicant orders which only used sandals and those which went entirely barefoot.

Design

Normally made of leather and hobnailed, the calceus was flat soled and typically reached the lower shin, entirely covering the foot and ankle. It was secured with crossed thongs or laces. Equivalent to a short boot or high-top shoe, it was lighter than the military caliga but sturdier than slip-on shoes like the soccus and able to easily handle outdoor use. 

Calcei were considered a distinctive part of the national dress of male Roman citizens, alongside the toga. The combination of toga and calcei was impressive, but also hot and uncomfortable. The Roman poet Martial claimed that, in their leisure time and in the more relaxed surroundings of rural life, hardly anyone used it by the early imperial period. Even in Rome, some high-ranking citizens preferred to wear light Grecian sandals or socci rather than calcei to "go with the crowd".

Types

The calcei of most plebs was made of undyed but tanned leather. (The version made with untanned rawhide instead was known as the pero.) The "patrician calceus"  seems to have often been dyed red, Tyrian purple, or some equivalent. Senators and higher ranking priests were likewise expected to wear the mulleus or "red calceus"  along with their red-edged toga praetexta while engaged in their public duties. Festus claimed the mulleus was originally used by the kings of Alba Longa before being adopted by the patricians. Cassius Dio states that the patrician shoes were originally marked with the letter R, although early forms of Latin used an R closer in shape to the later P. Francis X. Ryan has offered that this class distinction in footwearrather than procedural statusmay have been responsible for the name of the backbencher . Cato the Elder stated that, by the end of the Republic, plebs who had reached curule office were entitled to the formerly patrician footwear. Plebeian generals like Marius who celebrated a triumph were likewise permitted to wear them. Talbert states that by the imperial era there is no conclusive evidence that footwear continued to differ between the classes as a whole, possibly because the emperors began to restrict the use of certain status symbols to themselves.

Other calcei were distinguished by their ornamentation. The "equestrian calceus"  or) included distinct crescent-shaped buckles. The "senatorial calceus"  was likewise distinguished by a crescent-shaped ornament, an ivory lunula attached to the back of the shoe. By the mid-imperial period, this was probably made of black leather.

The "turned calceus" (New Latin) was an unrelated pointy-toed unisex Etruscan form of footwear, which received its name from a passage in Cicero where he references Juno Sospita's , "little calceus-like shoes".

The Chinese Confession Program was a program run by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in the United States between 1956 and 1965, that sought confessions of illegal entry from US citizens and residents of Chinese origin, with the (somewhat misleading) offer of legalization of status in exchange. It was an important component of U.S. immigration policy toward the People's Republic of China.

Historical context

The Chinese Confession Program marked the last decade in the life of the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first major federal restriction of an entire specific ethnic group's immigration in the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act forbade the immigration of skilled and unskilled laborers from China. Exceptions were made for diplomats as well as certain family members of American citizens of Chinese origin. These exceptions were used by many Chinese to immigrate under false pretenses to the United States. For instance, Chinese-Americans who went home to visit family in China might bring back younger Chinese, claiming to be their parents. This practice was called "Paper Sons", and it came into prominence after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and accompanying fire destroyed many of the city's records.

The Chinese Exclusion Act was partially repealed with the Magnuson Act of 1943, which allowed for the immigration of a small number of Chinese (based on the proportion of the population currently present). However, this number was vanishingly small: about 105 per annum. Thus, a lot of migration from China remained illegal, and many American citizens and residents of Chinese origin could trace their presence in the United States to some form of immigration fraud.

The Chinese Confession Program was partly motivated by concerns in the United States about the rise of communism in China under Mao Zedong, and the role that Chinese-Americans might be playing in facilitating it, as well as the danger of communist Chinese entering the United States illegally.

Program details

Although the program was described as an amnesty program whereby people could confess their immigration violations and obtain legal status, there was very little change to the immigration laws. The program's primary benefit to confessors was that if they were eligible for a statutory remedy, their past illegal entry or misrepresentation of status would not bar them from having their paperwork processed.

The following statutory remedies were available:

 Those married to a United States citizen could apply to citizenship through that route (just as other legally present non-residents could) despite past illegal entry.
 Those who entered prior to June 28, 1940 were available for a statutory relief called "registry".
 Others could apply for suspension of deportation if extreme hardship and good moral character could be demonstrated.

Although confessing to the authorities offered (temporary) immunity from prosecution and deportation, the confessor had to surrender his or her passport and be amenable to deportation. Confessors needed to provide full details of their blood families as well as paper families (people with whom they had claimed to have a false relationship so as to facilitate illegal immigration). This meant that a single confessor could implicate a large number of other people, and therefore increase the risk of deportation for all these others.

Program use

The program resulted in 13,895 confessions, with about 10,000 in the San Francisco region (where the bulk of the illegally entering Chinese population was concentrated). This was far less than the number of people suspected of having entered illegally, and the less than complete usage of the program was attributed to lack of trust in the United States immigration enforcement agencies among the Chinese population, the lack of clear benefits from confessing, and the risk of deportation faced by the confessor as well as his or her (blood and paper) family. 

Since confessions by neighbors could implicate a person and lead to deportation, the program created fear and distrust in many Chinese-American communities. Anybody who had illegally entered and came in contact with the FBI before confessing was subject to immediate deportation.

The confessions had a significant impact on the Chinese-American community: as a result of the confessions, 22,083 people were exposed and 11,294 paper son slots were closed. For comparison, the 1950 Census listed 117,629 Chinese in America (excluding Hawaii).

End of the program

The Chinese Confession Program was ended in 1966, shortly after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

Reception

Fae Myenne Ng, author of Steer Toward Rock, called the Chinese Confession Program the Confusion Program, due to the confusion, suspicion, and mistrust it sowed in Chinese-American communities. 

Bill Ong Hing, a professor of law at the University of San Francisco, and an American of Chinese origin, compared the treatment of Chinese in the United States, leading up to the Chinese Confession Program, to the way the United States treats undocumented immigrants from Mexico today. He wrote: "The “confession program” for Chinese in the 1950s was mostly a fraud perpetrated on our community, but we need not repeat that fraud for undocumented immigrants today. Let’s be honest, and treat them with the respect they deserve."

Track listing
Uardry Station, most commonly known as Uardry, is a pastoral lease that has operated as both a sheep station and a cattle station in outback New South Wales.

It is situated about  east of Hay and  south west of Griffith and has  frontage to the Murrumbidgee River. The country is composed of flat plains predominantly covered in saltbush.

Uardry was initially established in 1840 by John Ray, with his partner Henry Angel arriving in 1844. The property was originally known as Wardry. Like most inland properties of the time it operated as a cattle station and Angel remained at the property until the 1860s.

In 1864 the property was acquired by Thomas and William Wragge along with John and James Hearne for £1,000; they converted Uardry into a sheep station. The partnership remained at the property for 11 years. The name was also changed from Wardry to Uardry on the advice from a surveyor that Wardry was the name of another station further north. Uardry is an Aboriginal word meaning yellow box tree.

In 1875, the property was acquired by Charles Mills, Andrew Neilson and William Smith. At the time the property had an area of . Shortly afterwards Mills was fortunate enough to acquire a small flock of pure Peppin Merinos, which he carefully bred to avoid outside blood to produce an excellent merino flock with "a bold combing wool of medium to strong quality". By the 1880s Mills was exhibiting at the Hay agricultural show, in which they won 104 champions and 60 second prizes. As his partners died Mills acquired their shares of the enterprise and eventually was the sole owner of Uardry. By 1900 Mills passed on the running of the property to his oldest son, Ainslie, and later his third son, Nelson, took control. In 1937 the property was regarded as one of the most highly improved and best irrigated, with 38 ground tanks, 11 wells and 17 sub-artesian bores equipped with windmills and troughs to supply water to stock.

The Black family held the property from 1973 to 2012, building the property into one of the most prestigious merino studs in Australia., expanding from one stud in 1973 to four in 2010. By the time it was sold Uardry had an annual turnover of 5 million with 350 active clients. The property was stocked with 25,000 sheep and 1,000 cattle.

In 2012 Uardry was acquired by Tom Brinkworth, who paid 30 million for the  for the property.
Brinkworth intended to use the water rights that Uardry held on the Murrumbidgee to use the property for cropping, to grow corn and silage, and to drought proof the rest of his livestock holdings. The merino flock including all of the stud merino was to be sold from the property.

In 2013 Brinkworth purchased 18,000 head of cattle for  million from drought affected properties on the Barkly Tableland owned by the Australian Agricultural Company. Brinkworth then had the cattle moved by droving them a distance of  to Uardry using old stock routes. Many were agisted at Uradry with the remainder of the herd being dispersed through Brinkworth properties in New South Wales and Victoria.

Yuezheng Ling is a vocal created by Shanghai Henian Information Technology Co. Ltd and was released for Vocaloid 3.

Development
To create strong support for the first Chinese Vocaloid, a contest was held to pick the most popular design. The winning entry would become a Vocaloid, while the runner up entries were included in the Vocaloid promotions. Yuezheng Ling was one of the runner up entries and appeared alongside Luo Tianyi in several animated shorts.

However, soon after Luo Tianyi was released, Shanghai Henian Information Technology Co. Ltd lost the rights to produce Vocaloids ending the Vocaloid China project. In March 2014, Shanghai Henian repurchased the character rights for all of the Vocaloid China cast members and relaunched the project as Vocanese.

Later, Vocanese confirmed that they had previously contacted some voice actresses and considered them to be less risky and had better efficiency. However, they refused to ignore any other potential voices for their new vocal, thus the audition was launched. In another response, Shanghai Henian stated that the participants' voices would be posted on the official Ling Weibo page.

On October 15, 2014, the winner was revealed to be Qi Inory and recording for two vocals began, one of which being the vocal of Ling. On November 20, Vocanese confirmed that even though Vocaloid 4 was revealed, they were still going to release Ling for Vocaloid 3.

Characteristics
According to the short animation series promoting Vocaloid China, Ling is a lively high school student. Her family runs the huge Yuezheng Group, a business that makes instruments and music. Her personality is very straight forward and can sometimes be seen as blunt as she does not care for details. She is extremely generous and energetic, for she spends 3/4 of the day running all over the place and sometimes, her high spirit causes boys to become jealous. She loves music, experiencing new things, and huge, fluffy dolls. However, Ling has many annoying issues in her life, mostly related to her older brother, Yuezheng Longya.

At Firefly Con 2015, additional traits and biographical information were added for Ling. It was also added that she is a fashionable rich girl and it was noted that the Vsinger cast were given official birthdays to allow them to have their own unique birthdays rather than having them all in July. It would also allow fans to be able to celebrate each of them easily.

It was explained that the additional information was catered to roleplayers. The day after, Henian responded that they added the extra biography in an attempt to make her more realistic, but since the fans reacted poorly to it, they were willing to adjust it according to the fans' opinions.

Vikings is a historical drama television series written and created by Michael Hirst for the television channel History. Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on 3 March 2013 in Canada, concluding on December 30, 2020. A standalone sequel streaming television series, Vikings: Valhalla, written and created by Jeb Stuart for Netflix, premiered on February 25, 2022.

Vikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France, while Vikings: Valhalla, set 100 years later, chronicles the beginning of the end of the Viking Age, marked by the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, and the adventures of Leif Erikson, his sister Freydís, Harald Hardrada and the Norman King William The Conqueror. The broad historical narrative of both series are based on real events, with some of the principal characters representing real figures from history and/or legend.

Vikings portrays Ragnar as a former farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes king, with the support of his family and fellow warriors: his brother Rollo, his son Björn Ironside, and his wives—the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the princess Aslaug. Vikings: Valhalla portrays Leif and Freydís as immigrants from Iceland to Norway, who are respectively pulled into the Viking campaign to conquer Great Britain and the growing religious divide between Christians and Pagans. As of 2022, The Seer (portrayed by John Kavanagh) is the only character to appear in both series.

Main characters

In 1999, even during the Taliban regime, she wrote and directed a play for a theater show for a group of Afghan women. After the Taliban regime came to an end, she started making films and her first feature film as a producer and director was Three Dots, known in Afghanistan as Se noughta, or Ellipsis. She made this film in less than two weeks, in a digital video format. The film, though not a quality product, still gave an exposure to the western audience on the status of women in Afghanistan. Sadat discovered Gul Afroz for the lead role in this film even though Afroz had no formal training in acting. When Afroz was prevented by her husband and family members to act in the film she threatened to commit suicide, but she eventually acted in the film. This film received "rave reviews" around the world.Three, Two, One related in illiteracy among women of her country which was produced by her sister Alka Sadat; this was slated for screening, in 2007, in the Afghan parliament to highlight the need for approving pending legislation on this subject.this movie be a great start for her because when the human rights commission gives the rights to the film, she can buy a small camera and editing system for her sister Alka Sadat then she starts to make the documentary film. 

Her fiction film Taar wa Zakhma meaning Playing The Taar screened at the 7th IAWRT Asian Women's Film Festival 2011 deals with the tribulations of a 17-year-old girl married to a much older man.

Kangiqtualuk Uqquqti (Inuktitut syllabics: ᑲᖏᖅᑐᐊᓗᒃ ᐅᖅᑯᖅᑎ) formerly Sam Ford Fiord is an isolated, elongated Arctic fjord on Baffin Island's northeastern coast in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. The Inuit settlement of Pond Inlet is  to the northwest and Clyde River is  to the east.

This fjord is reputed for the harsh beauty of its landscapes with rocky cliffs rising steeply from the shore. It is also a popular place with climbers.

History
Kangiqtualuk Uqquqti had been one of the traditional hunting areas of the Inuit. It was renamed in memory of Inuk linguist Sam Ford, who died in a helicopter crash but it has since reverted to its original name.

Geography

Kangiqtualuk Uqquqti stretches roughly from north northeast to south southwest for about . Its mouth, located between the Remote Peninsula and Erik Point, is over  wide, the width of the fjord narrowing gradually to an average of  about  inland. Kangiqtualuk Agguqti is a tributary fjord branching west from the fjord's western shore about  to the south of its mouth. The Stewart Valley —with Sail Peaks stretches northwards from Walker Arm's northwest corner and connects with the neighbouring Gibbs Fiord. Swiss Bay is a smaller inlet on the eastern shore of Sam Ford Fiord connecting through Ottawa Creek and Atagulisaktalik with the inner reaches of neighbouring Arviqtujuq Kangiqtua in the east. The Sam Ford River discharges its waters at the head of the fjord further south and Qikiqtakuluk is located within the inner section of the fjord off a small bay  to the north northeast of the river's mouth.

Sam Ford Fiord is known for its glaciers and its awe-inspiring stark granite cliffs, rising steeply from its shores to heights up to  above sea level in the area near Swiss Bay. Among the most impressive summits by the fjord Beluga Mountain, Rock Tower, Walrus Head Mountain, Broad Peak, Ottawa Peak, Sikunga Mountain, Turnagain Peak, and the Paalik Peak deserve mention.

A massive cliff on the eastern shore located at a bend in the fjord  from its mouth at  has a vertical wall dropping from a height of  to the fjord's waters.
Acacia subrigida is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae. It is native to an area in the  Wheatbelt, Mid West and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.

The erect shrub typically grows to a height of . It blooms from August to October and produces yellow flowers.
Melin Tregwynt (Tregwynt Mill) is a woollen mill in the hamlet of Tregwynt in the parish of  Granston, Pembrokeshire, Wales.
A mill has stood on this site since 1819 taking fleeces from the sheep farms of the area, carding and spinning them into woollen yarn and then weaving the yarn into cloth and blankets.
Today, the mill makes a line of upmarket blankets, cushions, clothing, and accessories.

History

Tregwynt woollen mill (Melin Tregwynt) lies in an isolated valley on the coast of Pembrokeshire. It is about  from the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. The hipped and whitewashed rubble stone building has the date of July 1819 on a roof truss. It was originally a corn mill, and was converted to a woollen mill later in the 19th century. The mill was part of the Tregwynt estate. On the 1841 Tithe Map, it was called Dyffryn Bach, owned by G. J. Harries and occupied by David Evans.

The local farmers would sell their fleeces to the mill, which would wash, card, comb, and spin the wool into yarn and then weave it into blankets.
The mill was powered by water from the local stream.
In an unusual design, the water wheel is inside the building.
The large iron overshot wheel probably dates to the later part of the 19th century.
The water wheel drove hammers that beat the woven cloth to clean and soften it.
Later the water wheel drove leather belts that powered the carding engines and looms. 
This equipment has been preserved in the old section of the mill.

The present owner's grandfather bought the mill for  £760 in May 1912 and operated it with his son.
During World War II the mill devoted most of its capacity to making knitting wool, which was not rationed. In the 1950s the owners opened a shop at the mill and in St Davids and Fishguard, and started to develop Melin Tregwynt as a brand. The business thrived in the 1960s and 1970s and survived the recession in the 1980s that forced many other Welsh mills to close. The founder's grandson entered the business and started to develop foreign markets.

Recent years

As of 1997 the mill was weaving  of cloth each month.
Melin Tregwynt now outsources some processes, including carding and spinning.
The mill's water wheel still functions but is no longer used to power the machinery. The 2008 Guinness Book of Records noted that the mill had woven the world's largest picnic blanket for Waitrose. In 2012, the mill celebrated 100 years as a family business, now weaving for a global market. The looms are still manually warped, the knots are tied by hand and the blankets are finished by hand.
Melin Tregwynt operates a cafe at the mill as well as the shop.

In September 2012, Melin Tregwynt was featured at Heal's in London during the London Design Festival. In 2012 the Welsh fashion designer Jayne Pierson created a line of bespoke women's wear for Melin Tregwynt. The mill featured in a BBC Two Wales Made in Wales episode in December 2012. The mill's products have been featured on various TV shows including Big Brother and Doctor Who. In 2013, the mill exhibited at the Milan Furniture Fair. In 2015, a design by Melin Tregwynt was used as the pattern for a dance choreographed by Angharad Harrop to be performed in the National Theatre Wales and Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru.

As of 2016, the mill employed about 30 people.
It is a Grade II listed building.
Nord Stream 2 (German–English mixed expression for "North Stream 2") is a  natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany running through the Baltic Sea, financed by Gazprom and several European energy companies. The construction of the pipeline started in 2011, to expand the Nord Stream 1 line and double annual capacity to . It was completed in September 2021, but has not yet entered service. Planning and construction of the pipeline were mired in political controversy over fears that Russia would use it for geopolitical advantage with Europe and Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had been in favour of the project, suspended its certification on 22 February 2022, following official recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic by the Russian State Duma and President Putin during the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On 26 September 2022, Danish and Swedish authorities reported a number of explosions at pipes A and B of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and pipe A of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, with the resulting damage causing significant gas leaks. The European Union considers the incident to be sabotage of key European energy infrastructure. The Nord Stream explosions also resulted in the worst release of methane gas in human history, with estimates ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 tons of methane released into the atmosphere. In October 2022, Russia confirmed that Pipe B of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline escaped destruction, and offered to resume gas supply to Europe (which was promptly declined by Berlin).

Gas deliveries ceased in September 2022 following the destruction of three of the pipe lines and sanctions linked to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of February 2023, there is no conclusive evidence of who carried out the sabotage despite three separate investigations by Denmark, Germany, and Sweden.

History
In 2011, Nord Stream AG started evaluation of an expansion project consisting of two additional lines (later named Nord Stream2) to double the annual capacity up to . In August 2012, Nord Stream AG applied to the Finnish and Estonian governments for route studies in their underwater exclusive economic zones for the third and fourth lines. It was considered to route the additional pipelines to the United Kingdom but this plan was abandoned.

In January 2015, Gazprom announced that the expansion project had been put on hold since the existing lines were running at only half capacity due to EU sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea in 2014. In June 2015, an agreement to build Nord Stream 2 was signed between Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, and Engie. As the creation of a joint venture was blocked by Poland, in April 2017, Uniper, Wintershall, Engie, OMV and Royal Dutch Shell signed a financing agreement with Nord Stream2 AG, a subsidiary of Gazprom responsible for the development of the Nord Stream2 project.

On 31 January 2018, Germany granted Nord Stream2 a permit for construction and operation in German waters and for landfall areas near Lubmin. In May 2018 construction started at the Greifswald end point. In January 2019, the US ambassador in Germany, Richard Grenell, sent letters to companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream2 urging them to stop working on the project and threatening them with the possibility of sanctions. In December 2019, the Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson also urged Allseas owner Edward Heerema to suspend the works on the pipeline, warning him that the United States would otherwise impose sanctions. Cruz formally proposed such a bill to enable sanctions in November 2021.

In December 2019, Allseas announced that the company had suspended its Nord Stream2 pipelaying activities, anticipating enactment of the US National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, which contained sanctions. In May 2020, the German energy regulator refused an exception from competition rules that require Nord Stream2 to separate gas ownership from transmission. In August 2020, Poland fined Gazprom €50 million due to its lack of cooperation with an investigation launched by UOKiK, the Polish anti-monopoly watchdog. UOKiK cited competition rules against Gazprom and companies financing the project, suspecting that they had continued work on the pipeline without permission from the government of Poland.

In December 2020, the Russian pipelaying ship Akademik Cherskiy continued pipe-laying. In January, Fortuna, another pipe-layer, joined forces with the Akademik Cherskiy to complete the pipeline. On 4 June 2021, Vladimir Putin announced that the pipe-laying for first line of the Nord Stream 2 had been fully completed. On 10 June, the sections of the pipeline were connected. The laying of the second line was completed in September 2021.

In June 2021, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Nord Stream2 completion was inevitable. In July 2021, the US urged Ukraine not to criticise a forthcoming agreement with Germany over the pipeline. On 20 July, Joe Biden and Angela Merkel reached a conclusive deal that the US may trigger sanctions if Russia used Nord Stream as a "political weapon". The deal aims to prevent Poland and Ukraine from being cut off from Russian gas supplies. Ukraine will receive a $50 million loan for green technology until 2024 and Germany will set up a billion-dollar fund to promote Ukraine's transition to green energy to compensate for the loss of the gas transit fees. The contract for transiting Russian gas through Ukraine will be prolonged until 2034 if the Russian government agrees.

On 16 November 2021, European natural gas prices rose by 17% after Germany's energy regulator suspended approval of the Nord Stream 2.

On 9 December 2021, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called on Germany's newly appointed Chancellor Olaf Scholz to oppose the start-up of Nord Stream 2 and not to give in to pressure from Russia. On a visit to Rome, Morawiecki said: "I will call on Chancellor Scholz not to give in to pressure from Russia and not to allow Nord Stream 2 to be used as an instrument for blackmail against Ukraine, an instrument for blackmail against Poland, an instrument for blackmail against the European Union."

Scholz suspended certification of Nord Stream 2 on 22 February 2022 in consequence of Russia's recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics and the deployment of troops in territory held by the DPR and LPR.

Nord Stream 2 AG filed for bankruptcy on 1 March 2022 and laid off all 106 employees from its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland.

On 26 September 2022, a massive pressure loss and signs of large gas releases near the Danish island Bornholm were reported. Shortly after, gas leaks from the two pipelines were discovered within the Danish and Swedish economic zones. The day after the leaks occurred, Swedish police opened an investigation of the incident, calling it "major sabotage". The investigation is conducted in cooperation with other relevant authorities as well as the Swedish Security Service. A similar investigation was opened in Denmark. The two nations were in close contact, and had also been in contact with other countries in the Baltic region and NATO. These gas leaks were soon considered to be sabotage. On 29 September 2022, the Swedish Coast Guard confirmed a second leak from Nord Stream 2 very close to a larger leak found earlier on Nord Stream 1.

Development

Costs and financing
For Nord Stream 2, the loan from Uniper, Wintershall Dea, OMV, Engie, and Royal Dutch Shell covers 50 percent of the projected costs of €9.5 billion. The rest is being financed by Gazprom.

Project companies
Nord Stream 2 was developed and is operated by Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of the Russian state energy company Gazprom headquartered in Zug, Switzerland.

Contractors

Nord Stream 2 was laid by Allseas using pipe-laying vessels Pioneering Spirit and Solitaire, except the part of the German offshore section which was laid by Saipem's pipe-laying vessel C10. Pipes were manufactured by EUROPIPE, OMK and the Chelyabinsk Pipe-Rolling Plant (Chelpipe), and were coated by Wasco Coatings Europe. Blue Water Shipping handled the transportation and storage of pipeline segments in Germany, Finland and Sweden for Wasco. A joint venture of Boskalis and Van Oord did rock placement at the preparatory stage of construction. Kvaerner did the civil and mechanical engineering of the onshore facilities in Russia.

Technical features

Route

Except for the Russian and Danish section, the route of Nord Stream 2 follows mainly the route of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.

Russian onshore-pipeline
To feed Nord Stream 2,  of new pipeline and three compressor stations were built and five existing compressor stations were expanded. The feeding pipeline starts in Gryazovets and follows the existing route of the Northern Lights pipeline. In Volkhov, the pipeline turns south and continues to the Slavyanskaya compressor station near Ust-Luga.

Baltic Sea offshore pipeline
Nord Stream 2 starts at the Slavyanskaya compressor station near Ust-Luga port, located  south-east of the village of Bolshoye Kuzyomkino (Narvusi) in the Kingiseppsky District of the Leningrad Oblast, in the historical Ingria close to the Estonian border. A  onshore pipeline runs from the compressor station to the landfall at the Kurgalsky Peninsula on the shore of Narva Bay. The landfall point in Kolganpya (Kolkanpää) at the Soikinsky Peninsula was considered as an alternative.

Except for the Russian section, the route of Nord Stream 2 follows mainly the route of Nord Stream 1. From the Russian landfall, a  section runs through Russian territorial waters to the Finnish exclusive economic zone. The Finnish section is  and the following section in the Swedish exclusive economic zone is  long.

The  Danish sections runs on the Danish continental shelf southeast of Bornholm. The German part of the pipeline consists of  of offshore pipeline and  onshore pipeline connecting the landfall with the Nord Stream 2 receiving terminal. Nord Stream 2 has two parallel lines, each with a capacity of  of natural gas per year.

Middle and Western European pipelines
Nord Stream 2 is connected to the NEL pipeline and European Gas Pipeline Link (EUGAL), which runs largely parallel to the OPAL pipeline.

Legal aspects

EU gas directive
According to the amended EU gas directive, the EU extended its gas market rules to external pipelines entering the EU internal gas market. It applies to all pipelines which were completed after 23 May 2019 when amended directive entered into force. Additional legal concerns relate to international trade law and to the law of the sea in connection with Nord Stream 2's route through the Danish territorial waters around Bornholm.

Nord Stream 2 AG had started legal proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Union to annul the amended directive and also started arbitration against the EU under the Energy Charter Treaty. Although Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and has terminated its provisional application, both the EU and Switzerland — a domicile of Nord Stream 2 AG — are contracting parties of it.

US sanctions and subsequent waiver and negotiations 
In June 2017, new US sanctions against Russia targeting the pipeline were passed by a 98-2 majority in the United States Senate due to concerns that President Trump would ease existing sanctions on Russia. The sanctions were sharply criticized by Germany, France, Austria and the European Commission who stated that the United States was threatening Europe's energy supplies. In a joint statement, Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said, "Europe's energy supply is a matter for Europe, and not for the United States of America." They also said: "To threaten companies from Germany, Austria and other European states with penalties on the US market if they participate in natural gas projects such as Nord Stream 2 with Russia or finance them introduces a completely new and very negative quality into European-American relations."

Isabelle Kocher, chief executive officer of Engie, criticised American sanctions targeting the projects, and said they were an attempt to promote American gas in Europe. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz called the sanctions "a severe intervention in German and European internal affairs", while the EU spokesman criticized "the imposition of sanctions against EU companies conducting legitimate business." German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that "European energy policy is decided in Europe, not in the United States". Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also criticized sanctions, saying that United States Congress "is literally overwhelmed with the desire to do everything to destroy" Russia–United States relations.

The German Eastern Business Association said in a statement that "America wants to sell its liquefied gas in Europe, for which Germany is building terminals. Should we arrive at the conclusion that US sanctions are intended to push competitors out of the European market, our enthusiasm for bilateral projects with the US will significantly cool."

In January 2019, the US ambassador in Germany, Richard Grenell, sent letters to companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream 2 urging them to stop working on the project and threatening with the possibility of sanctions. In December 2019, the US Congress approved sanctions on companies and governments working on the pipeline, to which German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas responded, urging the US not to meddle in European energy policy. Following the US Senate's vote to override the Trump administration's veto of the defense bill containing punitive measures on the pipeline, the US State Department alerted companies of sanctions risk they face, urging them to pull out from the project. According to a PolitiFact "fact check", the sanctions did not impede construction of the pipeline.

In December 2019, with overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans, the US Congress imposed sanctions on any firm aiding in the building of the pipeline as part of the annual defense policy bill. The pipeline's construction was stalled for a year until Russia secured its own vessels to complete the job.

Following incoming President Joe Biden's inauguration in January 2021, the White House reaffirmed long standing US opposition to Nord Stream stating that Biden "continues to believe that Nord Stream 2 is a bad deal for Europe" and that his administration "will be reviewing" new sanctions. According to congressional aides cited in a February report by NBC News, the sanctions enjoyed "strong bipartisan support" on Capitol Hill.

On 19 May 2021, the United States President Joe Biden waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO Matthias Warnig, in a move that was opposed by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, with Republican senator Jim Risch saying it was "a gift to Putin and will only weaken the United States". Russian and German officials welcomed the sanctions waiver, but Yuriy Vitrenko of Naftogaz criticized the move and said Ukraine would press Washington to impose sanctions to stop the pipeline. On 25 May at the White House, President Biden told reporters that he waived the sanctions because the pipeline was nearly completed and because they would have hurt relations with Europe.

In protest against the Biden administration's policies, senator Ted Cruz held up dozens of diplomatic nominations, telling CNN "I look forward to lifting the holds just as soon as they impose the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 that are required by federal law." According to PolitiFact, this positive signal to Germany and Russia was accompanied by sanctions on other areas of Russian industry as part of a changing strategy to reopen negotiations over Ukraine.

On 19 May 2021, the US government waived sanctions against the main company involved in the project, Nord Stream 2 AG, while imposing sanctions on four Russian ships and five other Russian entities. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov welcomed the move as "a chance for a gradual transition toward the normalisation of our bilateral ties". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was "surprised" and "disappointed" by Biden's decision. Biden also waived sanctions on the Nordstream CEO, Matthias Warnig, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. On 22 November 2021, the US State Department announced that it had imposed further sanctions on a Russian vessel and a "Russian-linked entity".

Washington Post reports that Biden obtained a promise from Angela Merkel in summer 2021, that Nord Stream 2 would not be sanctioned, but that Germany would support other sanctions, and Germany would scrap Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine. By the time Russia invaded in 2022, Olaf Scholz had replaced Merkel, but Scholz kept the promise.

On 21 July 2021, the US and Germany proposed an agreement to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline while shielding Ukraine and other Central and Eastern European countries from any future Russian efforts to use the pipeline as a geopolitical weapon. The deal was immediately opposed by Ukraine and Poland and US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with Foreign Policy reporting that it had become a "lightning rod issue" and that "Biden's post-Trump-era honeymoon period with some Eastern European allies has come to a screeching halt." Deutsche Welle reported that the deal promoted "strong condemnation" from Poland, with government spokesman Piotr Müller saying "We have emphasized from the very beginning that Nord Stream 2 is a geopolitical project that destabilizes the political situation in central and eastern Europe." Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė called the project a "mistake" saying it was not just for its economic impact on Ukraine, but for the EU's increased dependence on a country where there is no rule of law.

In September 2021, a group of bipartisan lawmakers in the US House of Representatives attempting to undo Biden's decision to waiver sanctions, introduced an amendment to the defense bill. In November 2021, a group of Senate Republicans led by senator Risch renewed efforts to impose sanctions on the pipeline, also as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) defense bill. In response, the Biden administration reportedly lobbied Democratic allies to nix the sanctions amendments, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top aides reportedly made calls urging senators to kill the sanctions amendments that would remove leeway for a White House waiver. Republicans stalled the bill from passing on 29 November, but it passed the next week on 7 December, omitting the sanctions amendments despite strong support for them in Congress.

On 13 January 2022, US Senator Ted Cruz introduced a bill to reimpose the waived sanctions regardless whether Russia invaded Ukraine. Democrats favored a more extensive version which would impose a wider range of sanctions besides those on Nord Stream 2. The bill was voted on with 55 senators (49 Republicans, 6 Democrats) in favor, and 44 Democrats who opposed the bill with Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Menendez arguing that imposing immediate sanctions centered on Nord Stream 2 regardless if Russia invaded Ukraine would give Putin one less reason not to invade and that sanctions would have to go far beyond Nord Stream to be effective. The Cruz bill failed to secure 60 votes needed for passage but Senators continued work towards a bill expanding sanctions far beyond those on Nord Stream.

Following reports of Russian troops massing near the border with Ukraine and fears of an invasion, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced new sanctions on 23 November, targeting eight people and 17 vessels as "pursuant to PEESA in connection with Nord Stream 2".

In order to provide strong incentives for Russia not to invade Ukraine, bill sponsor Senator Bob Menendez argued that sanctions would have to be devastating to the entire Russian economy, and that every Russian would have to feel them. The wider set of sanctions in Senate bill 3488, "Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022" would impose significant compliance challenges for companies doing business in Russia, not just Nord Stream and its European and Russian backers. Although both parties had reached agreement on central parts of the plan, by mid February Biden and US intelligence agencies were briefing allies and Congressional leaders that Russia would likely invade.

The work on the sanctions bill was paused and replaced with a declaration critical of Russia's provocative and reckless military buildup along Ukraine's border and warning Putin to cease his threats to Ukraine and NATO. Earlier in the month, Menendez and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell had been personally assured during a visit by German Chancellor Scholz that if Russia invaded, Nord Stream 2 would be halted.

Regulatory clearance by Germany
In late October 2021, the approval of the pipeline was still in process as permits were expected from the German regulator (Bundesnetzagentur) and finally from the European Commission later that year. The German agency still awaited the processing of applications by the Ukrainian gas company Naftogaz and the Ukraine gas grid company GTSOU. Poland also voiced opposition to the approval of the pipeline as it feared a lack of Russian gas transits through its territory. However, spokesperson for the German Ministry of Economy Beate Baron said on 22 October 2021 "all the available capacities for natural gas supplies from Russia to Europe are used".

Earlier that week, the Swiss-based operator confirmed it had filled the first line of the pipeline with "technical" gas. On 21 October 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the pipeline would start gas delivery the day after Germany approved it. Regulatory clearance for Nord Stream 2 would double Russia's gas exports to the Baltic and Germany to 110 billion cubic meters per year. Economic pressures for its approval in Germany were mounting, as tight supplies and soaring prices increased costs in transportation and heating fuel markets.

Approvals for gas delivery through the fully constructed pipeline were further delayed in late November 2021, when Germany required that part of the assets of the Switzerland-registered Nord Stream AG including the pipeline itself to be transferred to a Germany-registered business entity. Concurrently, the US Department of State imposed more financial sanctions on Russian companies connected to Nord Stream 2. President Joe Biden earlier waived sanctions on German companies involved in the project. The US and the European Union had accused Russian-owned Gazprom of not having delivered sufficient gas through existing pipelines, while Russia claimed that those pipelines were already delivering natural gas at full capacities. According to energy analysts, the delay of gas deliveries through Nord Stream 2 had significantly exacerbated the 2021 energy crisis.

Suspension of certification by Germany 
In February 2022, Menendez and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell had been personally assured during a visit by German Chancellor Scholz that if Russia invaded, Nord Stream 2 would be halted.

On 2 March, it was reported that Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom, had ended business operations and laid off all 106 members of its staff as a result of sanctions imposed as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though earlier reports that it had filed for bankruptcy were denied.

Royal Dutch Shell, which financed 10% of the project, may have to write off $1 billion if it never opens. On 2 March, Wintershall Dea revealed that it had decided to write off its financing of Nord Stream 2, which it highlighted totals around €1 billion. On 7 March, Uniper announced that it had taken the decision to record a full impairment loss on its loan to Nord Stream 2. The company noted that it will recognize an impairment loss of its loans towards Nord Stream 2 AG in the amount of €987 million.

Nord Stream 2 AG could seek compensation from the German government and international arbitration under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT).

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia wrote in Twitter: "Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros per thousand cubic metres!" suggesting prices were set to double.

European Commission 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the future of the pipeline would depend on Russia's actions in Ukraine. On 19 February 2022 she told the Munich Security Conference that Europe could not be overly dependent on Russia for its energy needs.

Controversies

Political aspects
President Barack Obama opposed Nord Stream2, echoing the policy of his predecessor George W. Bush who opposed Nord Stream1. The US and European nations such as Ukraine, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania opposed Nord Stream 2 on the grounds that it increased dependence on Russian energy and posed a security threat to the EU. After 2014, these countries further argued that Europe should not be refilling Russia's coffers after it invaded and annexed Crimea. In January 2018, United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reaffirmed the policy, stating US and Poland opposed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, for the same reasons of European energy security and stability.

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been opposed by a wide range of US and European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Slovak President Zuzana Čaputová, US President Joe Biden, former US President Donald Trump, Estonian PM Kaja Kallas, the European Council President Donald Tusk and former British foreign minister Boris Johnson. Tusk has said that Nord Stream 2 is not in the EU's interests. Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have questioned the different treatment of Nord Stream 2 and South Stream projects.

Some claim that the project violates the long-term declared strategy of the EU to diversify its gas supplies. A letter, signed by the leaders of nine EU countries, was sent to the EC in March 2016, warning that the Nord Stream 2 project contradicts the European energy policy requirements that suppliers to the EU should not control the energy transmission assets, and that access to the energy infrastructure must be secured for non-consortium companies. A letter by American lawmakers John McCain and Marco Rubio to the EU criticized the project in July 2016.

An anti-trust investigation against Gazprom started in 2011 revealed a number of "abusive practices" the company applied against various recipients in the EU and Nord Stream 2 was criticized from this angle as strengthening Gazprom's position in the EU even more. European Commission officials expressed the view that "Nord Stream 2 does not enhance [EU] energy security".

Sberbank's investment research division in 2018 voiced concerns from Russian stakeholders' perspective, specifically that the project's goals are exclusively political:

Public opinion in Germany
A representative Forsa study conducted in May 2021 found that 75% of Germans were in favor of the construction of Nord Stream 2, while only 17% were against it. The survey found that broad support for the completion of the project could be found in all voter groups. This was after Germany's phase out from nuclear power plants.

Criticism of US sanctions and obstruction efforts
The Ost-Ausschuss der Deutschen Wirtschaft (Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations) criticised that US sanctions and obstruction efforts were thus threatening democratic processes in Germany and Europe, endangering Germany's interests, and causing damages estimated to be several billion euros at the expense of European taxpayers and businesses.

The Danish Dilemma 

While Denmark had all the natural gas it needed, it became the centre of the geopolitical conflict due to  Bornholm. Denmark has maritime territorial rights in the waters south of Bornholm, where the Nord Stream 2 consortium wanted to build, parallel to the already existing gas line, Nord Stream 1. While the US is Denmark’s most significant security ally, Germany is arguably the most important EU partner for Denmark, which meant that Denmark was in an undesirable position, where its closest allies had conflicting interests. An official application for the route was received in 2017. After the application, the Danish Parliament added an amendment to the Continental Shelf legislation, so that security and foreign policy considerations could be weighed together with environmental and economic considerations when assessed applications for submarine pipelines in the Danish territorial Sea. Thus the application for the initial route through Danish territorial sea ended on the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs' table, where it laid for so long that the consortium behind Nord Stream 2 ended up withdrawing its application in 2018. A permit was given in 2019 for an alternative southeastern route in the Danish exclusive economic zone.

Opposition 
Nord Stream 2 faced opposition from Western politicians outside Germany, who saw it as an instrument of Russian influence in German and European politics. Common reasons for the opposition to Nord Stream 2 are negative historical relations with Russia and strongly supporting common and shared EU positions towards Russia.

President of the European Council Donald Tusk said that Nord Stream 2 is not in the EU's interests. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have questioned the different treatment of Nord Stream 2 and South Stream projects. Some claim that the project violates the long-term declared strategy of the EU to diversify its gas supplies.

A letter, signed by the leaders of nine EU countries, was sent to the EC in March 2016, warning that the Nord Stream 2 project contradicts the European energy policy requirements that suppliers to the EU should not control the energy transmission assets, and that access to the energy infrastructure must be secured for non-consortium companies. A letter by American lawmakers John McCain and Marco Rubio to the EU also criticized the project in July 2016. Isabelle Kocher, chief executive officer of Engie, criticised American sanctions targeting the projects, and said they were an attempt to promote American gas in Europe.

In June 2017, Germany and Austria criticized the United States Senate over new sanctions against Russia that target the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, stating that the United States was threatening Europe's energy supplies. In a joint statement Austria's Chancellor Christian Kern and Germany's Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that "Europe's energy supply is a matter for Europe, and not for the United States of America." They also said: "To threaten companies from Germany, Austria and other European states with penalties on the U.S. market if they participate in natural gas projects such as Nord Stream 2 with Russia or finance them introduces a completely new and very negative quality into European-American relations."

In January 2018, United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the U.S. and Poland oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying they see it as undermining Europe's overall energy security and stability. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline was also opposed by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, U.S. President Donald Trump, the European Council President Donald Tusk and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

Stance of Germany and role of the SPD 
Questions have mounted about the links between the pipeline project, leaders of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), and Moscow. One of the last acts of former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in office was to sign the deal creating the Nord Stream 1 project in 2005. Schröder subsequently became chairman of the company behind it and took several directorial positions in Russian energy companies in the following years. In more recent years, opposition to his lobbying became more heated across Germany.

The project was supported by the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the landfall site for the line, and where former Chancellor Angela Merkel had her constituency. In 2019 the US sanctioned German companies and individuals helping to build the line. In January 2021, state premier Manuela Schwesig set up a Foundation called  to "acquire, manage, own, provide or let land, tools and machines to help the completion" of the pipeline. In 2022, questions mounted about the Foundation, its association with Gazprom and its activities that helped companies helping to build the project evade US sanctions. On 24 February 2022, the German Court of Auditors expressed concern about the Foundation, which said it would stop helping the pipeline project, declining to say what it had done so far. Public records showed it purchased a ship to complete the laying of pipeline in the Baltic.

In January 2022, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who long supported the project, came under pressure to block the project at the 2022 EU summit. Amid reported misgivings of many in the Biden administration about Berlin's stance on Russia, Chancellor Scholz visited the US for what Foreign Policy called a "salvage mission". After avoiding the pipeline issue at a press conference at the White House on 7 February, Scholz responded to repeated questions from reporters saying the US and Germany were "absolutely united", while Biden went further and said that the Nord Stream 2 project would end if Russia invaded Ukraine.

Following the meeting with Biden and ahead of a meeting scheduled with Russian President Vladimir Putin for 15 February, Scholz faced criticism in the media for refusing to say openly that Germany would cancel the pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, though others said it was due to diplomatic tactics or legal concern. Following the Scholz and Putin meeting in Moscow, Putin said the pipeline would cement European energy security, and that it is "purely commercial". Scholz then visited Kyiv to meet Ukrainian president Zelenskyy and was accused of using the "Merkel playbook" when avoiding questions about the pipeline at a joint press conference.

In February 2023 internal audit of tax authorities in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania revealed that tax declarations by a Gazprom-funded Climate Foundation were missing, initially declared as "lost", then ultimately found at home of one of the tax office employees, who subsequently burned it in her fireplace.

Alternative gas import mechanisms 
As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the global natural gas supply crises, on 27 February, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Germany would quickly build two LNG terminals for seaborne LNG imports, one at Brunsbüttel and another at Wilhelmshaven. The Wilhelmshaven LNG terminal is under construction and expected to be able to receive gas deliveries as early as January 2023.By August 2022, this had expanded to plans to open facilities at five floating LNG facilities in Germany as soon as practicable.

Unusually, environmental impact assessments are being explicitly skipped according to Robert Habeck, a Green party politician and the environmental affairs minister in the current German government, saying "ensuring Germany was no longer blackmailable by Putin had to take priority."

The Wilhemshaven terminal alone will be sized initially to receive approximately 80 LNG tankers each year, which could substitute for up to half of the gas imports that the German energy company Uniper formerly imported from Russia, and could supply approximately eight percent of German gas demand as it was in early 2022.

Others
The Economist warned that Europe is becoming more dependent on Russia while its own reserves decline. Vincent Roberti of Roberti Global and Walker Roberts of BGR Group have received more than $5 million and $1.3 million respectively to lobby the US Congress for the gas project.

2022 gas leaks

On 26 September 2022, Denmark and Sweden almost simultaneously reported four gas leaks from Nord Stream 1 and 2 in the Baltic Sea; two leaks in the economic zone of each country. Despite the fact that Nord Stream 1 was shut down and Nord Stream 2 had not commenced transporting gas, there was gas under pressure in each of the four pipes. Most of this gas is methane. More than half of the gas has already leaked out, and there are no containment mechanisms in the pipelines – the rest of the gas was expected to leak out before 1 October. By 10 October, some gas still seeped out of Nord Stream 2, with a surface plume 15 metres wide. The European Union released a statement accusing the Russian Federation of sabotaging the pipeline as retaliation for the EU's support of Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Andrew Baxter, director of energy strategy for the Environmental Defense Fund, said he estimated that about  of methane had been released into the environment. To date, this may be the largest gas leak in human history. According to German estimates, about  of methane, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases (more potent than CO2), was emitted into the atmosphere. This amount of gas is enough to affect the environment for another 20 years, with an annual gas emission capacity of 5.48 million cars.

On 29 September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the "unprecedented sabotage" against the Nord Stream gas pipelines was "an act of international terrorism" carried out by the West, US forces specifically, claiming the United States would have "much to gain from sabotaging the pipelines"  even offering to keep supplying the EU by the only Nord Stream 2 gas tap left functional. The charge was promptly vehemently denied by both US and its NATO allies. While not directly pointing fingers at Russia, European leaders have suggested a foreign attempt to "energy blackmail" NATO citizens into withdrawing their support in Ukraine while noting that it is Russia, not Europe, that benefits from chaos in the energy markets and the war.

Despite having three separate investigations by Norway, Sweden, and Germany, as of February 2023, there is no assignment of the blame of the sabotage yet. In February 2023, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article based on a single unnamed source alleging the attack was carried out utilizing American and Norwegian assets. Several factual inaccuracies in Hersh's post have been pointed about by the Norwegian media, including the claim that Alta-class mine sweepers had participated in BALTOPS 22, or the claim that Jens Stoltenberg had been cooperating with US intelligence services since the Vietnam War, despite him being a teenager at the time.  On 17 February 2023, Russia formally submitted a proposal to the Security Council of the United Nations calling for an investigation into the Nord Stream sabotage, and reiterated its request on 20 February 2023.

According to Politico and Dagbladet Information, on 22 September 2022, the Russian carrier ship SS-750 and Priz-class deep-submergence rescue vehicle AS-26 were detected by the Danish patrol boat P524 Nymfen above the route of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline at the site of the sabotage. 26 photos were taken of the Russian ship in this location.

On 6 June 2023, it was reported that a European ally had sent intelligence to the US, informing them that the Ukrainian military was plotting an attack on the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines, three months before the pipelines were attacked. According to the intelligence, the plan to attack the pipeline was “put on hold" and that Ukraine’s commander in chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi "was put in charge" of the operation so that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, could not be aware of it.

The bilateral relations between Italy and the Republic of China (Taiwan) are a subject of China–Italy relations. Since Italy recognized the People's Republic of China on 6 November 1970, Italy under the One China principle maintains relations with Taiwan on an unofficial basis. Both Italy and Taiwan as part of the Japanese Empire were members of the Axis Powers in World War II.

Trade links
Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, trade links between Italy and Taiwan accounted for US$4.13 billion in 2014, with Italy being Taiwan's fifth largest trading partner in Europe. Approximately 40 Taiwanese companies had  investments in Italy worth US$322 million in 2011. In 2015, the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Italian Parliament, passed a bill on avoiding double taxation with Taiwan. An agreement to that effect was completed in 2016.

Representative offices

Taiwan is represented by the "Taipei Representative Office in Italy" in Rome. This also has responsibility for San Marino, Malta, Albania and  Macedonia. This was established in 1990 as the Associazione Economica e Culturale di Taipei, before adopting its present name in 1996.

Another body, based in Milan,  known as Centro Commerciale Per L'Estremo Oriente, had previously been established as a trade office in the early 1970s. This is now known as the "Taiwan Trade Center", operated by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council.

Similarly, Italy is represented by the Italian Economic, Trade and Cultural Promotion Office. It was established in its present form in 1995. It was originally established in 1989 as the "Italian Trade and Economic Center". Arrangements for the opening of the office were made through San Shin Trading Ltd., the local agent for Fiat cars in Taiwan.

In 1992, the Office was renamed the "Italian Trade Promotion Office". In that year, it also began issuing visas. Previously, visa applications were forwarded to the Italian Consulate General in Hong Kong. In contrast to other countries, during the SARS crisis in 2003, Italy did not impose travel restrictions or quarantines on Taiwan tourists, with the Italian Economic, Trade and Cultural Promotion Office continuing to issue visas as normal.

History
During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, Japan and Italy had diplomatic relations.

Until 1970, Taiwan, as the Republic of China, was represented by an embassy in Rome and a consulate-general in Milan. This was separate from the Embassy of the Republic of China to the Holy See, which, while located in Italian territory, remains accredited to the Vatican City. This led to confusion in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing, when Italians protested outside the embassy, believing it to be that of the People's Republic of China.

In 2005, the then President, Chen Shui-bian, was allowed to enter Italy to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II, travelling on a China Airlines charter flight.

China Airlines began flights between Taipei and Rome in 1995, which became a codeshare service with Alitalia in 2003.

In 2014, Taiwan  decided not to participate in Expo 2015 in Milan after the Italian government proposed that it be represented as a corporate entity rather than as a country.

In 2020 Taiwan donated equipment and supplies to Italy as part of its medical diplomacy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Equipment donated included 15 respirators donated to who hospitals in the hard hit Lombardy region in April 2020.

Kushiroite is a rare mineral of the pyroxene group, with formula CaAlAlSiO6. It is the fully aluminian member. The formula of kushiroite corresponds to the molecule (or component) known as Calcium-Tschermak (Ca-Tschermak), which dominates in the composition of kushiroite. Kushiroite is an aluminium-analogue of other pyroxene-group members, davisite, esseneite, and grossmanite. It was found in a chondrite meteorite within refractory inclusions.

The mineral crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system (space group C2/c).

Music in Tunisian Arabic has appeared in the 17th century. It has developed a lot since the 19th century and has spread all over Tunisia mainly after the creation of Radio Tunis and Établissement de la radiodiffusion-télévision tunisienne. Nowadays, Tunisian Arabic has become the main language of songs in Tunisia including Tunisian music, Underground music and Opera.

The beginnings
The oldest lyrics found written in Tunisian Arabic date back to the 17th century. Their author was Sheykh Abu el-Hassan el-Karray, who died in 1693 in the medina quarter of Sfax, and wrote a poem in Tunisian Arabic during his youth:

Moreover, another Tunisian Arabic poem was written later in the 17th century to cite the qualities of Karray:

The effective beginning of songs written in Tunisian Arabic was in the early 19th century, when Tunisian Jews in the Beylik of Tunis began writing songs in Tunisian Arabic about love, betrayal and other libertine subjects. The current strengthened at the beginning of the 20th century and affected the Tunisian ma'luf and folklore. Judeo-Tunisian song flowered in the 1930s, with such Jewish artists as Cheikh El Afrit and Habiba Msika.

This tendency was promoted by the creation of Radio Tunis in 1938, which allowed many musicians to better disseminate their works and helped spread the use of Tunisian Arabic in songs. The pioneers of Tunisian Arabic song between 1930 and 1950 drew most of their inspiration from traditional Tunisian music, oriental or to occidental colors were Kaddour Srarfi, Hedi Jouini, Saliha, Salah El Mahdi, Hassiba Rochdi, Fethia Khaïri, Hassiba Rochdi, Mohamed Triki, Mohamed Jamoussi, Sadok Thraya and Ali Riahi.

The rise of Tunisian formal songs
Following the creation of the ERTT broadcasting organization in 1966, a generation of composers and interpreters, mostly working in the ERTT orchestra, emerged. In this wave, the range occupies a prominent place. Kalaï Ridha, Salah El Mahdi (regarded as a disciple of Tarnane), Kaddour Srarfi, Ali Shalgham, Chedly Anwar, Abdelhamid Sassi and others helped to train several singers, including Naâma, Oulaya, Zouheïra Salem, Soulef, Safia Chamia, Youssef Temimi, Mustapha Charfi, Hana Rached, Choubeila Rached, Ezzeddine Idir and many others.

Tahar Gharsa (another disciple of Tarnane) worked to promote the characteristically modal and rhythmic traditional music written with Tunisian Arabic lyrics. The director Raoul Journo, in the same line, is a judeo-Tunisian singer, distinguished by his interpretation of taâlila (traditional songs associated with birth, circumcision, marriage and other rites). This kind of music developed under the National Troupe of Music, created in the early 1980s.

The rise of Tunisian popular songs
At the same time, popular music developed in the early 19th century, using Tunisian Arabic poems accompanied by Tunisian musical instruments. Popular music includes Rboukh that is accompanied by a Mezoued, Salhi that is accompanied by a Ney and Sufi music that are religious songs mainly accompanied by Tambourins. This kind of music was promoted by the National Troupe of the Popular Arts, created in 1962. Later adaptation and promotion of popular songs, especially by Ahmed Hamza and later Kacem Kefi, further developed Tunisian music. Natives of Sfax, they were both influenced by Mohamed Ennouri and Mohamed Boudaya, leading masters of popular music in that city. Nowadays, this kind of music is very popular.

Tunisian Arabic became the main variety used in writing lyrics of songs in Tunisia and even the main technical words in music have their synonyms in Tunisian Arabic.

Underground and alternative music
In the early 1990s, underground music in Tunisian Arabic appeared. This mainly consisted of rap and was not successful in the beginning because of the lack of media coverage. Tunisian Underground music became successful in the 2000s, thanks to its spread over the Internet, and came to involve other alternative genres like reggae and rock. Underground music reached a height of popularity during and just after the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, as it spoke to the dire social matters faced by people in Tunisia.

In 2014, the first opera songs in Tunisian Arabic had appeared. They were the ones of Yosra Zekri that were written by Emna Rmilli and composed by Jalloul Ayed.

Ignasius Jonan (born 21 June 1963) is an Indonesian professional who was the Indonesian Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources serving under President Joko Widodo's administration. He is a former Indonesian Minister of Transportation and a former CEO of the Indonesian government-owned railway company, PT Kereta Api Indonesia (PT. KAI) which he headed from 2009 to 2014.

Born in Singapore, Jonan received his Bachelor's degree in Accounting from Airlangga University, Surabaya in 1986, and M.A. in International Relations and Affairs from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and Tufts University in 2005. He started his professional career in the banking sector, holding a managing director role and investment banking head in Citigroup Indonesia, before entering the public transportation sector in 2009. He was named by Sofyan Djalil, the then-Minister of State-owned Enterprises, to lead P.T. Kereta Api Indonesia.

Early life and education 
Jonan was born on 21 June 1963 in Singapore. He grew up in Surabaya, graduating from St. Louis 1 Catholic High School in the city. He later graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting from Airlangga University's School of Business and Economics in 1985. He took executive and management programs between 1999 and 2000 from Columbia Business School and John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Jonan received his Master's degree in International Relations in 2005 from the Global Master of Arts Program (GMAP) at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.

Career 
Jonan started his career as an accountant and investment manager. In 1999, he became Director for Private Equity at Citigroup branch in Indonesia. Two years later, he was appointed CEO of the government-owned investment firm, PT. Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia, assuming the role until 2006. From 2006 to 2009, he was promoted by Citi as Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking for Indonesia.

PT KAI
Jonan was appointed head of P.T. Kereta Api Indonesia in 2009, in the midst of the railway company's output and financial troubles, He was faced with PT. KAI's 27,000 employees with low expectations in terms of work quality, a financial deficit (in 2008, it lost Rp 82.6 billion), and a high percentage of substandard or broken locomotives, diesel trains, freight cars and crumbling stations. In an speech for the Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club, Jonan blamed the low train fares as a cause for the railway system's poor service and crowdedness.

Within 5 years, he overturned public perception of the failing Indonesian rail transportation system. The company was able to increase passenger ridership by 50% in 2014 compared to when Jonan took up the role in 2009. Freight loads have also doubled to nearly 30 million tons per year.

Transport minister 
On 26 October 2014, the newly-elected Indonesian President Joko Widodo named him as the 37th Minister of Transportation. Within this capacity, Jonan had wanted to ban ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Grab in 2015 citing existing regulations, but he was overridden by Widodo. In 2016, he again threatened a ban for the apps as they had not formally registered as taxi operators with the government. 

Following the crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 in 2014, Jonan alleged that budget airlines in Indonesia had been endangering passenger safety due to cost-cutting measures.

Energy and Mineral Resources minister
On 27 July 2016, President Joko Widodo removed Jonan from his post in a cabinet reshuffle. In response to the reshuffle, Ignasius Jonan, with a flat face, said, "I will come back". On 14 October 2016 the president appointed Ignasius Jonan again, but as Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources with Arcandra Tahar as his deputy.

The district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 and combined with the Municipal Borough of Ilkeston and part of the South East Derbyshire Rural District to form the new Erewash district.
The Church of St Michael and All Angels, is a parish church in the village of Mitchel Troy, Monmouthshire, Wales. The Grade II* listed building stands in the centre of the village, on the north side of the old road from Monmouth to Raglan,  south-west of Monmouth.

History 
The village of Mitchel Troy derives its name from the Welsh "Llanfihangel Troddi" which means "Church of St Michael by the Trothy". The River Trothy passes north of the church on its route towards Monmouth.

Very little remains of the original 13th-century church. At one time there was a spire on the church tower but in the 18th century it collapsed, demolishing the north aisle.

The present building is largely the result of rebuilding works undertaken between 1873 and 1876 by diocesan architect John Prichard for the 8th Duke of Beaufort. Members of the Beaufort family were officers of the church throughout the 19th century.

Architecture

Exterior
The church has an unusual narrow west tower with a castellated ashlar belfry. In the south-west corner of the tower is a large quoin stone, inscribed Orate Peo Godfride et Johanne. Little is known of its origin but it is said to be a foundation stone. Central to the south side of the nave is a large medieval gabled porch, above it the roof has steeply-gabled dormers with trefoil-headed lights.

At the entrance to the churchyard is a lych gate roofed in graded stone. The 15th century churchyard cross is missing the cross and top, but it is decorated with ball flowers which are echoed in the pulpit and reredos inside the church.

Interior
The church has a richly-detailed Victorian interior resulting from the patronage of the Beaufort estate. The nave roof is supported by pitch pine, arch-braced collar trusses.

In the south aisle, on one side of the doorway is a Norman tub font which was recovered from the Rectory garden. On the other side is an elaborate marble font, designed by Prichard, decorated with water lilies, passion flowers and netted fish. To the west of the doorway, a large inscription on the wall reads "To the Glory of God this church of St Michael and All Angels, built AD1208, was reconstructed Aug 4th AD 1876."

During the 19th century reconstruction, an ancient stone altar was unearthed at the end of the South aisle, with five consecration crosses representing the five wounds of Christ. The slab was remounted under the East window of the south aisle, serving as an altar for the Lady chapel. Also uncovered during the reconstruction was a stone which had been used as a piscina, but was discovered to be the lid of a child's coffin of early date. The stone is now set in the wall of the south aisle. At the end of the north aisle is a black marble reproduction of The Last Supper.

Some notable stone corbels can be found on the walls of the church. Above the nave the corbels bear a portcullis (the Beaufort heraldic badge) and St. George's cross (at the time of reconstruction the church belonged to the Church of England). On the outside of the organ chamber are five decorative corbels depicting an owl, a daffodil, a hawk, a flower and a nest of small birds being fed by their mother. On the south wall is an otter with a fish.

The choir stalls originally had carved figures of angels with musical instruments, but these were stolen in 1995. They have since been replaced by finials showing oak, ash, holly, ivy, hawthorn and bramble.

Opposite the entrance is a stained glass window dedicated to the Reverend Everett who supervised the reconstruction of the church. In the south wall is a window dedicated to the wife of the Reverend Sneyd who gave the Lady Chapel in memory of his son. In the north and south aisles are windows dedicated to two soldiers who died in the South African wars. In the west end of the chancel are windows dedicated to the wife and daughter of the Reverend Talbot and the east window represents the Ascension. At the west end is a window dedicated to General E. H. Somerset of the Beaufort family who died in 1886.

Inside the tower, there are three historic bells which are inscribed:
 G Tyler: H Williams: C Warden EE 1710
 CACHMAI: Tyler: William: Tucker: Churchwarden 1656 (dating from the time of the English Commonwealth)
 Wm Robinson Rector: Phil Stead: Ch Warden EE WE 1723.
Gonçalo Rosa Gonçalves Pereira Rodrigues (born 18 July 1997), known as Guga, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Rio Ave F.C. as a midfielder.

Club career

Benfica
Born in Faro, Algarve, Guga started his career at local club Lusitano FC in 2005, before joining S.L. Benfica's youth system at the age of 11. He made his professional debut with the latter's reserves on 13 August 2016, as a late substitute in a 2–0 away loss against Varzim S.C. in the LigaPro.

On 9 January 2019, Guga joined Panetolikos F.C. of the Super League Greece on a six-month loan deal with the option for an additional year.

Famalicão
On 26 June 2019, Guga signed a five-year contract with F.C. Famalicão. His Primeira Liga bow took place on 10 August, when he started and finished the 2–0 away win over C.D. Santa Clara. He scored his first goal on 14 September, the second of a 4–2 home victory against F.C. Paços de Ferreira.

Rio Ave
Guga joined Rio Ave F.C. on 14 January 2021, on a deal until June 2024. He played 20 matches until the end of the season, in an eventual relegation from the top division.

In the 2021–22 season, Guga made 40 appearances and scored 3 goals in all competitions for Rio Ave, helping the Vila do Conde club win the Liga Portugal 2 and achieve promotion back to the Primeira Liga. At the end of the season, Costinha was voted Rio Ave's Player of the Season by the club's fans. In addition, his goal on 22 August 2021 in a 3–0 win over local rivals Varzim was chosen as the club's Goal of the Season. On 5 July 2023, Guga was named the Liga Portugal 2's Player of the Season for 2021–22.

During the 2022–23 season back in the first division, Guga displayed a series of impressive performances, helping Rio Ave finish comfortably in 12th place. At the end of the season, with just 1 year left on his contract, Guga was linked to Portuguese giants FC Porto.

There are two different types of haze that can occur in materials:
Reflection haze occurs when light is reflected from a material.
Transmission haze occurs when light passes through a material.

The measurement and control of both types during manufacture is essential to ensure optimum quality, acceptability and suitability for  purpose of the product.
For instance, in automotive manufacturing, a high quality reflective appearance is desirable with low reflection haze and high contrast whilst in packaging clear, low haze, highly transmissive films are required so that the contents, foods etc., can be clearly observed.

Reflection Haze 

Reflection Haze is an optical phenomenon usually associated with high gloss surfaces, it is a common surface problem that can affect appearance quality.  The reflection from an ideal high gloss surface should be clear and radiant, however, due to scattering at imperfections in the surface caused by microscopic structures or textures (≈ 0.01 mm wavelength) the reflection can appear milky or hazy reducing the quality of its overall visual appearance.
            
Causes of this could be due to a number of factors –
                                                               
 Poor dispersion
 Method of applying the coating
 Variations in drying, curing or baking
 Types of materials used in the formulation
 Polishing or abrasion

A high gloss surface with haze exhibits a milky finish with low reflective contrast- reflected highlights and lowlights are less pronounced.
On surfaces with haze, halos are visible around the reflections of strong light sources.

Measurement

Measurement of reflection haze is primarily defined under three International test standards:

ASTM E430  
ASTM E430 comprises three test methods:

Test method A specifies a 30° angle for specular gloss measurement, 28° or 32° for narrow-angle reflection haze measurement and 25° or 35° for wide-angle reflection haze measurement.

Test method B specifies a 20° angle for specular gloss measurement and 18.1° and 21.9° for narrow-angle reflection haze measurement.

Test method C specifies a 30° angle for specular gloss measurement, 28° or 32° for narrow-angle reflection haze measurement and 15° wide-angle reflection haze measurement.

ASTM D4039  
Test method specifies gloss measurements to be made at 20° and 60°, the haze index is then calculated as the difference between the 60° and 20° measurements.

ISO 13803  
Test method specifies a 20° angle for specular gloss measurement and 18.1° and 21.9° for narrow-angle reflection haze measurement.

All test methods specify that measurements should be made with visible light according to CIE spectral luminous efficiency function V(λ) in the CIE 1931 standard observer and CIE standard illuminant C.

As most commercially available glossmeters have gloss measurement angles of 20°, 60° and 85° haze measurement is incorporated at either 20° (ISO 13803 / ASTM E430 method B) or at 20° and 60° (ASTM D4039). There are however some manufacturers that offer glossmeters with measurement angles of 30° and haze measurement in accordance with ASTM E430 Method A and C but are fewer in number, therefore for the purposes of detailing haze measurement theory only the first three methods will be included.

ISO 13803 / ASTM E430 method B 
Both test methods measure specular gloss and haze together at 20° that means light is transmitted and received at an equal but opposite angle of 20°.

Specular gloss is measured over an angular range that is limited by aperture dimensions as defined in ASTM Test Method D523. The angular measurement range for this at 20° is ±0.9° (19.1° - 20.9°). For haze measurement additional sensors are used either side of this range at 18.1° and 21.9° to measure the intensity of the scattered light. Both solid colours and those containing metallics can be measured using this method provided haze compensation is used (as detailed later).

ASTM D4039 
This method can only be used on nonmetallic materials having a 60° specular gloss value greater than 70 in accordance with ASTM Test Method D523 / ISO 2813. Haze Index is calculated from gloss measurements made at 20 and 60 degrees as the difference between the two measurements (HI = G60-G20).

As measurements of specular gloss depend largely on the refractive index of the material being measured 20° gloss will change more noticeably than 60° gloss, therefore as haze index is calculated using these two measurements it too will be affected by the refractive index of the material. Evaluations of reflection haze using this test method are therefore confined to samples of roughly the same refractive index.

Haze compensation 
It is important to note that the colour (luminous reflectance) of a material can greatly influence the measurement of reflection haze. As colour and haze are both components of scattered light (diffuse reflectance) they must be separated so that only the haze value is quantified; this is also true for metallics or coatings containing metallic pigments where a higher scattering exists.

As test method ASTM D4039 is only suitable for nonmetallic materials of more or less the same refractive index separation of the colour and haze components is not detailed. Haze index calculations and measurements using this test method will therefore produce higher haze results on brighter coloured materials than darker with the same level of haze present. The chart below shows these differences for various colours:-

Both ISO 13803 and ASTM E430 method B require a separate measurement of luminous reflectance, Y, to calculate compensated haze. The tri-stimulus value Y gives a measure of the lightness of the material as defined in ISO 7724-2 requiring a 45°/0° geometry to be used with standard illuminant C and 2° observer (although it is mentioned that slightly different conditions will not result in significant errors). Luminous reflectance measurements, Y, are required on both the sample material and a reference white; ISO 13803 details the use of a BaSO4 standard - barium sulphate, a white crystalline solid having a white opaque appearance and high density as this material is a good substitute for a perfectly reflecting diffusor as defined under ISO 7724-2.

Compensated haze can then be calculated as -

H Comp = H Linear – Y Sample / Y BaSO4

Using the ISO / ASTM method therefore to measure luminous reflectance produces a reliable measurement of Y for non-metallic surfaces as the diffuse component is lambertian, i.e. it is equal in amplitude at all angles in relation to the sample surface.

However, for metallic coatings and those containing speciality pigments, as the particles within the coating reflect the light directionally around the specular angle, little or no metallic reflection is present at the angle at which the luminosity is measured, therefore these types of coatings have an unexpectedly high haze reading.  Using a measurement angle which is closer to the region adjacent to the haze angle has proven successful in providing compatible readings on solid colours and also compensating for directional reflection from metallic coatings and speciality pigments

Applications 

Generally measurement of reflection haze is confined to high gloss paints and coatings and highly polished metals. Although there has been some degree of success using this measurement method for films it has proven unreliable due to variability caused by changes in the film thickness (internal refraction variations) and the background colour on which the film sample is placed. Generally haze measurement of films is performed using a transmission type hazemeter as described hereafter.

Transmission Haze

Light and transparent materials 

When light strikes the surface of a transparent material the following interactions occur –

•	Light is reflected from the front surface of the material

•	Some light is refracted within the material (depending on thickness) and reflected from the second surface

•	Light passes through the material at an angle which is determined by the refractive index of the material and the angle of illumination.

The light that passes through the transparent material can be affected by irregularities within it; these can include poorly dispersed particles, contaminants (i.e. dust particles) and/or air spaces. This causes the light to scatter in different directions from the normal the degree of which being related to the size and number of irregularities present. Small irregularities cause the light to scatter, or diffuse, in all directions whilst large ones cause the light to be scattered forward in a narrow cone shape. These two types of scattering behaviour are known as Wide Angle Scattering, which causes haze due to the loss of transmissive contrast, and Narrow Angle Scattering a measure of clarity or the "see through quality" of the material based on a reduction of sharpness.

These factors are therefore important for defining the transmitting properties of a transparent material-

Transmission – The amount of light that passes through the material without being scattered

Haze –  The amount of light that is subject to Wide Angle Scattering (At an angle greater than 2.5° from normal (ASTM D1003))

Clarity – The amount of light that is subject to Narrow Area Scattering (At an angle less than 2.5° from normal)

Measurement 

Measurement of these factors is defined in two International test standards-

ASTM D1003  
ASTM D1003 comprises two test methods:

Procedure A – using a Hazemeter

Procedure B – using a Spectrophotometer

BS EN ISO 13468 Parts 1 and 2  
Part 1 – Using a single beam Hazemeter

Part 2 – Using a dual beam Hazemeter

The test methods specify the use of a Hazemeter as shown below -

A collimated beam of light from a light source (ASTM D1003 - Illuminant C, BS EN ISO 13468 Parts 1 and 2 - Illuminant D65) passes through a sample mounted on the entrance port of an integrating sphere.

The light, which is uniformly distributed by a matte white highly reflective coating on the sphere walls, is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90° from the entrance port. A baffle mounted between the photodetector and the entrance port prevents direct exposure from the port.

The exit port immediately opposite the entrance port contains a light trap to absorb all light from the light source when no sample is present. A shutter in this exit port coated with the same coating as the sphere walls allows the port to be opened and closed as required.

Total transmittance is measured with the exit port closed.

Transmittance haze is measured with the exit port open.

Commercially available Hazemeters of this type perform both measurements automatically, the only operator interaction being the placement of the sample material on the measurement (entrance) port of the device.
Mystic Timbers is a wooden roller coaster located at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. Constructed by Great Coasters International and designed by Skyline Design, the roller coaster opened in the Rivertown section of the park on April 15, 2017. The ride's fictional theme is set to the site of an abandoned logging company where unexplained events are taking place. During its marketing campaign, the finale element in an enclosed shed was not revealed to the public until opening day.

Mystic Timbers was voted "Best New Ride" of 2017 in the annual Golden Ticket Awards publication by Amusement Today. Its opening also allowed Kings Island to reclaim the title of having the most wooden roller coaster track of any amusement park in the world with .

History

Kings Island officials began dropping hints during the 2016 operating season, which teased the possibility of a new, future attraction. In the park's Rivertown section, a construction wall was built displaying signs that stated, "Caution - Watch For Falling Trees". In June 2016, a set of plans labeled "Kings Island Project 2017" was submitted to the Mason planning board with designs for a new roller coaster. Until then, early speculation from enthusiasts believed that another possibility was a larger log flume to complement the nearby Race For Your Life Charlie Brown attraction. Later that month, media outlets in the area received a toy axe with an attached note hinting about activity in Rivertown. The following month, another clue surfaced, consisting of a blue toy pickup truck with a bundle of logs in the back. It contained a note stating that an official announcement would occur in the park on the evening of July 28, 2016.

On the night of the announcement, more than 1,000 park guests lined up two hours in advance to attend the evening event inside the park. It was revealed that the new attraction would be a roller coaster named Mystic Timbers. The new ride would mark the park's sixteenth roller coaster and fourth wooden roller coaster overall. Upon completion, Kings Island would reclaim the title of having the longest collection of wooden roller coaster track in the world at , when combined with the other three wooden coasters in the park – The Beast, both tracks on The Racer, and Woodstock Express. This surpassed the current record, Six Flags Great America, which measured the length of Goliath, Viper, American Eagle and Little Dipper at .

The ride's logo was unveiled as well, along with a simulated POV video of the ride. However, the simulation stopped short of revealing what happens when the train enters an enclosed shed near the end of the ride. Park officials indicated that the finale's details would not be revealed until opening day. The level of anticipation surrounding its debut put Mystic Timbers on USA Today'''s top nine list for most anticipated roller coasters of 2017.

Vertical construction of Mystic Timbers began in August 2016. On March 20, 2017, the ride performed its first test runs. The attraction opened for the press on April 13, 2017, allowing roller coaster enthusiasts and members of the media to ride early.

Characteristics
Mystic Timbers is themed around a fictional logging company, Miami River Lumber, that purchased the surrounding land for its timber. The company planned to use the adjacent Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad – the park's steam locomotive attraction – for shipping the timber out. However, an unexplained series of events led to the shutdown of the company, as the land was taken over by rampant natural growth.

The attraction was designed and built by Great Coasters International, a Pennsylvania-based company that specializes in the construction and restoration of wooden roller coasters. The  Mystic Timbers is  in length and reaches a maximum speed of . It features a  drop and sixteen airtime hills. Its three trains each carry 24 passengers, resulting in a total capacity of approximately 1200 riders per hour. The roller coaster's track layout utilizes the terrain and interacts with both the Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad and White Water Canyon attractions during its roughly two-minute ride cycle.

Ride experience

 Queue 
The queue begins with a sign at the main entrance displaying "Miami River Lumber Co." along with a checkpoint themed for shipping/receiving lumber. It features a vintage GMC Truck that appears to have crashed into one of the sign's pillars. Music from the truck and a man speaking about the backstory of the ride is played. A message also plays occasionally "Do not enter. Mandatory and ongoing lockdown is in effect for the Miami River Lumber Company. Repeat, do not enter." Throughout the entire queue, most of the rails are made of wood, adding to the theme. At the beginning of the queue, the path is very windy and features television screens showing security cameras of the woods. One clip shows two people exploring. Another clip shows a security guard running off screen from being frightened by something in the woods. Otherwise, the screens display the woods as if security is searching for something. The queue leads toward the back of the station and then returns to the front depending on the number of guests waiting to ride. It eventually leads to a staircase that takes riders up to the station. Riders will take a left into the station, which contains many props that resemble a lumber workspace. Throughout the queue and in the station, riders will hear spooky instrumental music.

 Layout 
The ride begins with the train leaving the station, upon which it makes an S-turn to the right, crossing over the railroad, then to the left, before climbing the lift hill. Upon latching on to the lift hill chain, a pre-recorded voice chastises the riders saying, "Hey! Hey! I see you up there! What on Earth do you think you're doing? This is security. Seriously, guys, you need to take that truck, go home to your video games. This place is not safe." Cresting the 109 foot lift hill, the chain slows again so that another pre-recorded voice can tell the riders over loudspeakers, "Whatever you do, don't go in the shed!" At the top, the train makes a swooping 98 foot drop to the left, before rising over another hill. At the crest of this second hill, the train makes another left turn and crosses over the lift hill, before diving close to the ground and traveling over a series of airtime hills. The track briefly enters a covered tunnel as it makes a left-hand turn to change directions and return towards the station. The return track runs mostly parallel to the outbound track until near the second drop, where it veers away to hit a brake run, coming to a stop outside the entrance to the shed.

The Shed
Upon stopping on the brake run, a pre-recorded audio segment is heard. A security guard is heard saying, "Don't go in the shed. This is a restricted area." The audio loops several times and begins to glitch and skip, eventually changing to, "Go in the shed." The train proceeds slowly into the shed, which is only dimly-illuminated by flickering overhead lamps and fluorescent lights. After passing through the storage tracks, the train comes to a stop approximately where the shed crosses over the railroad once again. In this room, an assortment of saws, vines, leaves, a Coca-Cola vending machine, and other items left behind by workers are visible. A cassette player starts playing music from the 1980s until a loud screeching sound is heard. Projection screens show one of three random creatures, followed by a 90° turn to the right as the train re-enters the station.

 Bats: A large group of bats swoop at the train followed by a giant one that swarms the middle of the screen. 
 Snake: A huge snake appears on the screen and appears to take a biting lunge at riders.
 Tree: First, a swarm of insects can be seen crawling on some tree branches. Next, a giant tree comes alive giving the illusion of grabbing the train as it passes by.

Awards
In 2017, Mystic Timbers was awarded "Best New Ride" by Amusement Today'' in their annual Golden Ticket Awards publication. Overall, it was ranked eleventh among all wooden roller coasters.

The Beretta APX is a family of polymer-framed, modular, striker-fired semi-automatic pistols designed and produced by Beretta. The series began in 2016, starting with the full-size standard model. The size of the line has grown, with the design branching off into law enforcement, concealed carry and competition-targeted models.

History
Designed largely for the U.S. Armed Forces' XM17 Modular Handgun System competition. Beretta had offered to provide their M9A3 model at a reduced price as a continuance of M9 procurement program, but were informed that the changes to the M9A3 were so significant that it fell outside the scope of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), and that the United States Department of Defense preferred to go through a new procurement instead.
Should the Beretta APX have won the MHS competition it would have been manufactured in the Beretta factory in Gallatin, Tennessee. Beretta maintains administrative offices at the location of the first factory in Accokeek, Maryland, but moved the factory due to the Maryland Legislation posture of unfriendliness to firearms makers, dealers, and owners.

On February 28, 2017, Beretta USA announced the APX availability for the US civilian market starting on April 15, 2017.

In 2018, three variants of the APX were announced: the APX Centurion, with a slightly smaller frame, slide and barrel, and the APX Compact, with a subcompact-sized frame, slide and barrel, and the APX Combat, with a threaded barrel and a mounting plate for optics on the slide.

In April 2019, Beretta introduced the APX Carry, a single stack magazine variant intended for the concealed carry market. The APX Carry is based on the Beretta Nano design with some features incorporated from the full sized APX. In July of that year, Beretta introduced three more designs, starting with flat dark earth variants of the Centurion and Compact models. The Centurion Combat was also introduced, which features a threaded barrel and mounting plate, just like the full sized APX Combat. Finally, the APX Target was introduced, which is a competition variant of the APX with a longer slide and barrel; these are fitted to each other at the factory to ensure greater accuracy. The slide also has a mounting plate for optics and the sights have been changed to a fiber-optic front sight and a blacked out rear sight. In addition to the changes to the slide and barrel, the frame also has no finger grooves to better suit the needs of competition shooters. The frame also features an extended magazine release and slide stop, as well as a green striker guide for a competition trigger. The APX Target trigger is half a pound (~2.2 N) lighter than a standard model and a shorter reset.

In May 2022, Beretta announced the APX A1, an ergonomically improved standard APX designed by Giovanni Prandini. The slide is red dot optic ready and features more aggressive slide serrations and Beretta's "Aqua Tech Shield" finish, alongside a newly designed frame with more aggressive stippling, a higher, undercut trigger guard, an enhanced beavertail and no finger grooves.

Design
The Beretta APX represents Beretta's first striker-fired duty-sized handgun. The name APX refers to "Advanced Pistol X" (the "X" referring to a caliber of choice), as the firearm is fully modular and can change calibers and frame sizes somewhat easily. In order to comply with the MHS specification, the firearms must support different grip sizes to fit shooters of different stature. The APX supports this with replaceable grip straps. The distance from the axis of the barrel to the top of the handgrip has been kept to a minimum of  in order to reduce muzzle rise, which increases the ability to accurately fire quick follow-up shots. As specified in the MHS specification, the APX also features a MIL-STD-1913 rail under the front of the frame.

Unlike other Beretta pistols, the APX uses the traditional Browning tilting-barrel short recoil design. The serialized part of the gun is a stainless steel chassis which allows true modular reconfiguration.  by allowing the factory black frame to be changed with a number of different options, including flat dark earth (FDE), tan, wolf grey and olive drab. Replacement frames are also available without finger grooves. The slide and barrel are coated in a black nitride finish, except for a newer FDE model that has a cerakote FDE slide and black nitride barrel.

Similar to Beretta's 92 and PX-series pistols, when the APX's trigger is pulled, the top of the striker block safety extends from the top of the pistol. This serves as a visual indicator to the user that this safety is working properly and has been disengaged. Unlike a number of striker-fired pistols, such as the Glock, which have to have the trigger pulled during take down, the APX has a striker deactivation button that can be pushed to deactivate the striker, thus preventing accidental discharge, which other striker-fired pistols can suffer due to user negligence during disassembly. There is also an automatic striker block safety.

The trigger mechanism features a drop safety. If the pistol is dropped, this prevents inertia from causing the trigger to fire the weapon, thus preventing accidental discharge.

Sol Collective is an organization based in Sacramento, California.  It is community center that is reportedly dedicated to healthy lifestyles the arts, and culture. It also has a background in activism. It operates in a similar format to the La Peña Cultural Center in Berkeley. It has worked in partnership over the years with organizations such as Verge, the Crocker and the Sacramento History Museum. It serves as a platform for performing and visual arts.

Overview
Sol Collective was founded in 2005 by Estella Sanchez, a daughter of Mexican immigrants. In 2003, while working as a teacher, she founded the group. While taking her lunch break one day, she saw an empty building with a "for rent" sign. At the time she was staying with her father so she had a bit of disposable income. She then rented the building and that was the start of the collective. The organization was first located at Del Paso Boulevard. In 2008 a fire destroyed their premises and around 2009, they ended up on 21st Street. Sanchez is a former adviser at the Sacramento Met School, and drug-prevention counselor.

According to an article in the November 15, 2015 edition of The Sacramento Bee, they were looking for new premises. In October 2016, director Sanchez was attempting to raise $35,000 which was required to complete the $100,000 down payment on the premises of the organization. The landlord was selling and $406,000 was the purchase price. At the time of an article appearing in The Sacramento Bee on October 11, at least $4,156 had been raised by their online crowdsourcing campaign.

Events
Annually the organization hosts the "Honoring Our Past" event in collaboration with the Sacramento History Museum. On the 29th of October they held the “Skulls and Skeletons: Day of the Dead Printmaking Workshop” at the museum.

In 2015, along with other organizations they worked in collaboration with The Ethnic Studies Program and The Center for Families, on the “Semillas y Culturas~Seeds and Cultures” Conference which was held at the Woodland Community College.

During the 20th century, specifically in the Interwar period, athletics became a point of social integration in Jewish communities throughout Europe. Specifically within German society, playing sports provided a chance for Jews to gain social standing and even notoriety for their accomplishments. Additionally, cheering for local area sports teams and clubs provided a common (secular) point of interest between Jews and non-Jews. While there are many instances of social integration and acceptance as a result of sports, antisemitism was common at sporting events in central Europe as well. Discrimination, provocation, and riots occurred at sporting events and in response to Jewish athletes, coaches, and managers. As such, the public perception of Jewish athletics was mixed, with notable examples of fame and antisemitism throughout the 20th century.

Jews and sports in Germany

An example of the success that some Jewish athletes achieved in Germany can be seen through Daniel Prenn, a Russian-born tennis player who competed for the German national tennis team in the 1920s and 1930s. Through Prenn was a Russian citizen, his notable wins for Germany in the Davis Cup helped to bring him the acclaim and recognition that was primarily reserved for non-Jewish athletes in Germany. As a result of his numerous victories, Prenn was featured in an article in the Israelitisches Familienblatt (IF), a German newspaper. While the IF normally relegated articles on sporting events to the secondary sections of the publication, by 1932, sporting articles were often featured with large headlines—and even photographs of Jewish athletes—in primary sections of the newspaper. These changes were unprecedented in the IF, and provided hope that sports could become a path for Jews in Germany to reach social integration and equality.

Additionally, as Jewish athletes such as Daniel Prenn began gaining notoriety for their accomplishments, German publications and spectators became more favorable toward them. In another German publication, Vossische Zeitung, Prenn's success was well documented, with references to German spectators who began to accept Prenn as "Our Prenn" -- "Unser Prenn" in German. This acceptance of Prenn, a Jewish athlete, into German society was a large step forward for the Jewish hope to become equal and contributing members of German society.

Antisemitism in sports

While Daniel Prenn had experienced the acclaim and recognition of success for the German national tennis team in multiple Davis Cup victories, he was not immune to the hate and discrimination that plagued Jews in Germany. After negotiations with a local tennis racquet supplier fell through, Prenn was accused of breaking the laws of amateurism, and was eventually taken to court over the matter. While Prenn was found innocent of these charges, the German Tennis Association still decided to suspend Prenn for a six-month period to resolve the baseless claims. This discrimination against the Jewish Prenn came as a large blow to a younger generation of Jewish athletes in Germany who admired Prenn and his accomplishments. As a result of these allegations and the unnecessary and unwarranted suspension by the German Tennis Association, Prenn ended up leaving the German association in favor of the Jewish sports club, Berlin Bar Kochba.

Public perception of Jewish athletes

Despite the success seen by many Jewish athletes in German sports competitions, hateful and derogatory comments were still common among German spectators. An example of this rabid anti-semitism occurred during a sporting competition in Rostock, Germany which featured many sports clubs, including Berlin Bar Kochba, which was a primarily Jewish club. After Bar Kochba's athletes began winning many of the events at the competition, chants of "Hep Hep" were made throughout the crowd of spectators. These anti-Jewish chants (in reference to the Hep-Hep Riots of 1819) nearly pushed Bar Kochba to withdraw and leave the competition entirely.

Another example of the rampant antisemitism that plagued Jewish athletes across Europe came from the soccer matches played by Hakoah Vienna, a Jewish sports club in Austria. While derogatory comments were present in any soccer match, these same comments turned into antisemitic comments when Hakoah took the pitch. Comments of "Jew pig" or "dirty Jew"—translated from the German "Judensau" and "Drecksjude"—were common for Hakoah players and supporters. These actions against Hakoah Vienna were not limited to hateful comments, but extended into rioting as well. In August 1923, at a match between Hakoah Vienna and Ostmark, the Austrian news publication Wiener Morgenzeitung reported that these riots featured verbal abuse and constant antisemitic threats levied against the "Jewish pigs" of Hakoah. While this publication focused on the riots occurring at that particular match, it made mention of the constant barrage of threats and insults thrown toward Hakoah players and supporters at every match, even at their home field in Krieau.

The 2016 Niger Delta conflict is an ongoing conflict around the Niger Delta region of Nigeria in a bid for the secession of the region, which was a part of the breakaway state of Biafra. It follows on-and-off conflict in the Christian-dominated southern Niger Delta in the preceding years, as well as an insurgency in the Muslim-dominated northeast.

Background 
Like most other African countries, British Nigeria grouped people together for governance without respect for their religious, linguistic, and ethnic differences. The region became part of a Niger Coast Protectorate in the 1890s when communities of Niger Delta signed an agreement with the British colonial agents. It was subsumed into the Southern Nigeria Protectorate in 1900 without consultations with the people of the region. Southern Nigeria was then merged with the Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 despite the political and cultural differences between the various ethnicities. Nigeria, which gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, had at that time a population of 60 million people consisting of nearly 300 differing ethnic and cultural groups.

Nigeria's oil, which became its primary source of income after independence from the British Empire, was located in the south of the country. The Igbo-dominated secessionist state of Biafra that came into existence in 1967 acquired the oil-rich region which played a key role in the Nigerian civil war. Despite this, the region's development was ignored by successive governments. As a result, the region remains the poorest and most backward region of the country. The region's waters have also become highly polluted due to millions of tons of oil being spilled. Due to these reasons, the region has become afflicted with militancy.

People of the region have protested against the negative impact of the oil industry, corruption and lack of development. In recent years, militant groups seeking to control the resources have indulged in oil theft and violence which sometimes has been claimed as retribution for mistreatment of the locals by the oil industry. A violent insurgency was carried out under the banner Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) until an amnesty agreement in 2009 by Late President Umaru Musa Yar'adua. The election of Goodluck Jonathan (a Christian) as President of Nigeria was a significant factor in the ceasefire as he hailed from the region and was considered to be sympathetic to it. The conflict reignited after the election of Muhammadu Buhari (a Muslim) as president in 2015. This was due, in part, to rumours that Buhari was considering scrapping the amnesty agreement and, more generally, the traditional northern–southern and Muslim–Christian divide.

Conflict

February–August 2016
A spate of bombings on oil installations started in February 2016. The Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) then publicly announced its existence in March 2016. The NDA's declared aims are to create a sovereign state and they have threatened to disrupt Nigeria's economy to achieve their goals. The group has also criticised President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari for never visiting the region as well as for his detention of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader Nnamdi Kanu, who said he was not affiliated with either MEND or the NDA. A militant group calling itself Red Egbesu Water Lions later emerged in May 2016 and demanded his release, as well as that of former National Security Advisor Sambo Dasuki. It also demanded that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission de-freeze the bank accounts of Government Ekpemupolo, as well as unconditional compensation to the victims of the Bonga oil spill and Chevron gas explosion. It further threatened to shut down all oil exploration activities in the region of its demands were not met. Another group calling itself Egbesu Mightier Fraternity emerged in the same month, demanding the release of Kanu and Dasuki in 14 days and that the Nigerian military leave the Gbaramatu Kingdom and stop harassing Ekpemupolo. It also threatened to blow up all offshore facilities in the region if the government did not meet its demands.

A group calling itself Joint Niger Delta Liberation Force emerged in early June 2016 and vowed to launch six missiles in the Niger Delta on 7 June. It further warned that it will bring down any helicopter deployed in the area and that it might shut down the Nigerian satellite orbit within a week so that telecommunications within the country would be cut off. It also demanded that the Nigerian military leave the Ijaw communities. On 7 June, it renewed its threat claiming that it was going to target national buildings and infrastructure of oil companies in Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna, as well as all military formations in Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna and Benue.

A dispute then developed between the militant factions as one of the groups calling itself Reformed Egbesu Boys of the Niger Delta unilaterally announced a ceasefire on 13 June. Although the group agreed with other groups over cessation of hostilities, it was opposed to demands regarding Kanu and Dasuki.

A group calling itself the Niger Delta Red Squad declared its existence in late June 2016. The group claimed that it had blown up two pipelines belonging to Shell in the Asa/Awarra axis and also threatened to attack major oil pipelines in Oguta Council area, as well as shutdown all oil wells in Imo State. A few days later, another group calling itself Adaka Boro Avengers emerged, threatening to destroy oil producing facilities and warned all oil companies to leave the Niger Delta within a week In July, the group announced that it would declare an independent state on 1 August and warned all northern Nigerians to leave the region. It however abandoned its bid on the same day it was supposed to declare an independent state.

A group calling itself Asawana Deadly Force of Niger Delta also emerged in late June 2016 and demanded independence for the region within a few days while threatening to shut down oil production in the region if it failed to achieve its goal.

On 8 July, a new group called Niger Delta Revolutionary Crusaders (NDRC) bombed the Brass Creek Manifold in Bayelsa State. On 13 July, the group then declared a two-week ceasefire. On 1 August, the group released a statement in which it accused northern Nigerians of plotting to Islamisise the region in order to take control of its oil. After the new Boko Haram leader Abu Musab al-Barnawi threatened to increase attacks on Christians and destroy churches, the NDRC, on 6 August, threatened to kill Muslims and destroy mosques if Boko Haram carried out its threats.

On 9 August, Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate declared its existence and threatened to destroy refineries in Port Harcourt and Warri within 48 hours, as well as a gas plant in Otu Jeremi within a few days. The next day, the group reportedly blew up a major oil pipeline operated by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) in Isoko On 12 August, the group warned that it would blow up more oil installations in the future. On 19 August, the group was reported to have blown up two pipelines belonging to NPDC in Delta State.

Ceasefire
In late August 2016, the NDA declared a unilateral ceasefire and agreed to negotiations with the Nigerian government. After the declaration of a ceasefire by the Niger Delta Avengers, the Reformed Egbesu Fraternities comprising the three militants groups Egbesu Boys of the Niger Delta, Egbesu Red Water Lions and Egbesu Mightier Fraternity also announced a 60-day ceasefire.

Operation Crocodile Smile (August 2016–September 2016)

Nigeria's Army launched "Operation Crocodile Smile" in late August to get rid of all criminal activities in Niger Delta. On 26 September, five militants were killed in clashes while 23 were arrested. On 30 August, NDGJM blew up the Ogor-Oteri oil pipeline in the Delta state and declared the launch of "Operation Crocodile Tears" in response to the military's operation. On 1 September, the Nigerian Army captured Gabriel Ogbudje, a supposed ex-militant who they claimed had now become leader of a new militant group Otugas Fire Force. 14 oil workers and their driver on their way to Port Harcourt were kidnapped by unknown gunmen on 2 September after the vehicle transporting them was hijacked on Omoku-Elele road.

On 4 September, NDGJM claimed it had rigged all the marked oil and gas facilities with explosives and warned residents living nearby to evacuate. Chief of Army Staff Tukur Yusuf Buratai officially launched the operation on 5 September. Niger Delta Avengers mocked the operation on 8 September claiming 20 soldiers were killed in it and also claimed that the Nigerian military was harassing citizens of Niger Delta. The operation concluded on 11 September. During the operation, 23 militants were killed while 38 militant camps, 91 illegal refineries and bunkering sites were destroyed during the operation.

Continued insurgency (September 2016–present)

The oil workers kidnapped in early September were released by 18 September after the police engaged in a shootout with the kidnappers. On 13 September, NDGJM stated they had blown up the Afiesere-Iwhrenene pipeline belonging to NPDC in Ughelli North. On 19 September, the group stated they had blown up a crude oil pipeline belonging to NPDC near Ekuigbo in Ughelli North. On 20 September, Abraham Suru, one of the suspected leaders of NDA was arrested.

On 24 September, Niger Delta Avengers claimed they had blown up the Bonny pipeline. On 27 September, a militant group calling itself Niger Delta Volunteers (NDV) warned the government that it will cripple all its infrastructure that generated income, describing the bombing by Avengers on Bonny pipeline as a "child's play". It also warned oil companies to evacuate their staff and suspend their operations, adding that their next strike will be deadly. Meanwhile, Niger Delta Justice Defence Group (NDJDG) blew up an oil pipeline in Gokana. On 28 September, NDJDG warned Buhari that they will destroy any national asset he tries to sell. Meanwhile, a militant was killed in clashes between NDA and Imo Security Network in Owerri. On 29 September, NDGJM claimed it had blown up the Unenurhie-Evwreni pipeline belonging to the NPDC.

On 9 November, Niger Delta Avengers said  it was behind an attack on Shell's Forçados crude pipeline a day earlier.

Reactions
MEND had condemned the ensuing militancy in its early days. However, by September it abandoned the negotiating position with the government and sought a unified voice for the Niger Delta, even proposing to work with the NDA.

The NDA announced its intention for a declaration of independence on 1 October, which gained the support of IPOB despite the group saying it was unaffiliated with the former as Powerful said: "We have nothing to do with MEND, but our philosophy aligns with that of Niger Delta Avengers who bravely called for the release of our leader and had maintained it till date. Avengers and IPOB are one in pursuit of freedom for all the peoples of Biafra. IPOB is in total support of the proposed independence declaration proposed by Avengers on the 1st of October." However, later IPOB and the Renegade Indigenous People of Biafra (RENIPOB), a faction from the Kanu-led IPOB, decided to re-unite and would surrender to the Nigerian government on 15 January 2017. As a consequence its intention for the burning of the flag of Biafra on 1 October was then replaced by an intention of surrender to the government.

Following Kanu's arrest, IPOB spokesman, Comrade Emma Powerful said of Nigeria that it was a "contraption done by the former British colonialists which is no longer working, hence the quest of the Biafrans to opt out of the incompatible marriage – the 1914 Amalgamation."

A green bank (sometimes referred to as green investment bank, clean energy finance authority, or clean energy finance corporation) is a financial institution, typically public or quasi-public, that uses innovative financing techniques and market development tools in partnership with the private sector to accelerate deployment of clean energy technologies. Green banks use public funds to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies that, despite being commercially viable, have struggled to establish a widespread presence in consumer markets. Green banks seek to reduce energy costs for ratepayers, stimulate private sector investment and economic activity, and expedite the transition to a low-carbon economy.

In the United States, green banks have been created at the federal, state and local levels. The United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Malaysia have all created national banks dedicated to leveraging private investment in clean energy technologies. Together, green banks around the world have driven approximately $30 billion of clean energy investment.

History
In the US, the green bank concept was originally developed by Reed Hundt and Ken Berlin, as a part of the 2008 Obama-Biden Transition Team’s efforts to facilitate clean energy development. A similar concept was adopted as an amendment to the federal cap and trade bill, called the American Clean Energy and Security Act, introduced in May 2009. A companion piece of federal green financing legislation was simultaneously introduced in the Senate, where it received broad bipartisan support.

When the 2009 cap and trade legislation ultimately failed to pass the Senate, green bank advocates in the US focused on the state level. The nonprofit Solar and Energy Loan Fund of St. Lucie County, Inc (SELF) was the first local government green bank created in America (2010). Connecticut established the first state green bank in 2011, followed by New York in 2013. By the end of fiscal year 2015, the Connecticut Green Bank had supported $663 million in project investments.

In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which established a national green bank intended to fund the existing and future network of green banks in the United States. 

In the UK in 2009, two reports were published advocating the creation of a state-backed infrastructure bank to provide financing to green projects. The first, entitled "Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank" was published in March 2009 by Climate Change Capital and E3G. The second, entitled "Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain" was published by Policy Exchange in September 2009 and was written by Dieter Helm, James Wardlaw and Ben Caldecott.

Essential elements
There are many types and styles of institutions that finance clean energy and green infrastructure projects. There are several key elements that distinguish green banks from other financing institutions: a focus on commercially viable technologies, a dedicated source of capital, a focus on leveraging private investment, and a relationship with government.

Green banks focus on commercially viable technologies, as opposed to early-stage innovative technologies, because they have been tested, have less associated “technology risk” and can reliably produce revenue for project owners. Green banks are public-purpose entities with some manner of a relationship with government, and are usually capitalized by public dollars.  Just like a commercial bank, green banks lend capital and own debt, so it is important they have their own balance sheet. Green banks also focus on using their capital to facilitate private entry into the clean energy market—specifically by using limited public dollars to leverage private investment in clean energy.

Market barriers 
For consumers, high upfront costs often make clean energy technology unattractive to adopt despite declines in clean energy technology costs.  Historically, the clean energy sector has depended on taxpayer-funded grants, rebates, tax credits, and other subsidies to drive market development.

Ideally, private lenders would provide financing to building-owners to cover upfront cost of clean energy adoption (beyond what is covered by rebates). However, there are capital market inefficiencies and inherent challenges to financing clean energy that have resulted in inadequate investment by private lenders. Some private lenders do offer financing for clean energy projects, but typically charge interest rates that are relatively high and loan tenors that are short.  Such terms make financing a clean energy project unattractive from the end-user's perspective. To be attractive from the end-user's perspective, financing terms would be such that the monthly cash flow from clean energy projects would be greater than the monthly payments for the cost of financing. This kind of cash flow structure is only possible with loan terms that match the expected lifetime of the projects savings, and with rates that are commensurate with the risk. Therefore, private capital offered at unfavorable terms (if it is available at all) undercuts the economic attractiveness of the project potential customers or project developers.

A shortfall of private financing exists for several reasons. One reason is that there is a relatively short track record for clean energy financing, and therefore there is little data for lenders to rely on.  Without data, and observable pipeline of similar projects, banks are left with high levels of uncertainty over how well different types of projects perform and how often borrowers repay their loans. This uncertainty leads to either hesitation to enter the market, high due diligence costs and/or unfavorable lending terms.

Another reason for the financing gap is that many clean energy projects are small and distributed. Building efficiency upgrades and rooftop solar projects are inherently small investments that are geographically dispersed, with varying credit among counter parties. Heterogeneity in clean energy projects is more expensive for a private lender to underwrite at scale, making loans for clean energy projects potentially uneconomical from the perspective of the lender.

A third reason for the financing gap is the lack of capital market liquidity and maturity. If a commercial bank provides an energy efficiency loan, it is unknown to the bank if it will be able to sell that loan to another lender or if it will have to hold that loan on its balance sheet.  Mortgage and auto lenders don't have this difficulty, because there are highly liquid secondary markets for home and car loans, which helps keeps rates low. These kinds of secondary markets are just now forming for clean energy technologies.

The final cause of private underinvestment relates to human and organizational behavior. To begin lending into a new market, a bank must hire new staff, learn about the risks and processes of a new market, and determine precise criteria for what kind of projects and credit ratings they are willing to lend to. This process may be time-consuming.

Financing activities
To combat these barriers to clean energy market development, green banks help consumers secure long-term, low-interest loans. Green banks harness a diverse set of financing techniques, including credit enhancements, co-investment, and securitization.

Credit enhancement 
Green banks frequently utilize credit enhancements to leverage private investment. Loan loss reserves, overcollateralization and subordinated debt can help assuage concern among private lenders who are interested in entering the market, but concerned about the risks associated with developers, counter parties or technologies with less established history in their given jurisdiction. Credit enhancements also help lower the cost of capital for borrowers and improve debt ratings from credit agencies.

Co-investment
Sometimes green banks invest directly in clean energy projects to facilitate additional private investment or improve the financial terms set by private lenders.

Securitization
Securitizing clean energy loans makes lending far more attractive for private investors. Individual clean energy projects, which vary in credit, location, and technology, can be expensive for a bank to underwrite, and may not achieve the desired scale of investment. Bundling these loans into portfolios and selling them (or shares of them) diffuses risk and creates scale, attracting a broader group of private investors.  A green bank can create and securitize portfolios of loans, allowing investors to purchase some portion of the green bank's debt on the secondary market. Green banks can also add credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization or loan loss reserves, to lower the creditors exposure to default risk and secure better ratings from credit rating agencies. Securitization provides greater liquidity in the market for clean energy project financing, which helps lower the cost of capital for borrowers.  The Connecticut Green Bank executed one of the first such securitization deals, selling 75% of its $40 million PACE portfolio to Clean Fund, a specialty finance company.

Financing structures
Green banks’ innovative financing techniques are more effective if they can operate through robust delivery mechanisms. Green banks can use these structures to increase the security of debt service payments and allow lenders to offer lower interest rates for clean energy financing.

Property assessed clean energy 
Property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing allows consumers to pay energy upgrade loans through property taxes. The process places a lien on the property, and the property owner then repays the financing through PACE assessments on the property tax bill.  This reduces the default risk associated with a loan and incentivizes private investment. Because the PACE structure reduces risk, it allows consumers to obtain lower interest rates on their loans.  Because the loans are attached to the property, when property is sold, the new owners take over loan repayment.

On-bill financing
On-bill financing permits consumers to repay energy upgrade loans through utility bills. Similar to PACE financing, on-bill repayment affords lenders security in a developing market. Because electricity is a necessity, utility bills have a very high rate of repayment nationwide. Placing loan payments on a utility bill increases their chances of being repaid, appealing to private investors and facilitating affordable loans for consumers.  Also, the on-bill structure enables renters to reap the benefits of added energy efficiency.  Furthermore, the simplicity of on-bill financing is attractive—it is logical that tenants pay for the good they consume.

GREEN Communitiy Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)

Prime example: The non-profit Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) is one of the first GREEN CDFIs in America and the first to focus exclusively on green financing for low- and moderate-income (LMI) homeowners. SELF is certified as a CDFI - Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) by the U.S. CDFI Fund (U.S. Treasury Department) and the organization was seeded by a DOE EECBG grant approved in 2009. SELF was the first local government green bank created in America in St. Lucie County, FL in 2010, by SELF's founder and executive director, Doug Coward. SELF was co-created and is co-lead by Coward and CFO/CSO Duanne Andrade. The organization currently operates in FL, GA, AL, and SC. As a CDFI, SELF focuses on financial inclusion, climate equity, and serving underbanked and unbanked communities. Unlike most CDFIs, SELF provides unsecured personal loans directly to homeowners to achieve energy efficiency, resilience, and  renewable energy (i.e., solar).  SELF has now developed a new plug and play FinTech model that will enable the organization to scale the program nationally through strategic partnerships, with an initial focus on the southeastern United States. SELF recommends the development of many more GREEN CDFIs across the nation, and is currently assisting with the development of new green banks and GREEN CDFIs in other states.

Market development activities 
Sometimes the availability of clean energy financing products is not enough to stimulate the desired level of clean energy finance activity, and various non-finance market development activities are necessary as well. A green bank may design and execute various market development activities to build the market for clean energy. Market development activities may not directly involve lending, and a green bank may hire an outside organization to design and perform these activities.

Demand aggregation 
Green banks or their partners can aggregate consumer demand for clean energy projects and financing to reduce customer acquisition costs for contractors and provide scale for investors.  One means by which a green bank might aggregate demand is a neighborhood-wide group-buying deal. The Connecticut Green Bank and SolarizeCT have used this technique throughout Connecticut.

Contractor training 
A green bank can organize contractor trainings, in which local clean energy technology installers, contractors, and developers learn about various green bank financing options. Contractor trainings allow contractors to use their knowledge of green bank financing products as a sales tool, increasing the size and volume of the projects they do. Ensuring that contractors fully understand green bank financing is a crucial means of getting that information to the end-users of the financing—building owners.

REC financing 
Innovative renewable energy credit (REC) financing plans have also helped green banks lower energy costs for consumers.  Green banks can agree to acquire and monetize the RECs that will be produced by a given clean energy project. After gaining possession of the RECs through the financing agreement, a green bank can then sell them to utilities. As a result of this activity, green banks can offer more favorable financing terms and utilities can obtain RECs in large volumes potentially at below market prices, reducing their cost of compliance and allowing them to pass savings on to their ratepayers.

Central clearinghouse  
Green banks also operate as an interface between lenders and borrowers. Green banks can offer a central clearinghouse for all online data on energy resources (including rebates and financing), technical assistance for investors, and project coordination services for contractors. By facilitating transparency and accessibility of resources, green banks bridge the gap between supply of and demand for capital for clean energy projects.

Organizational structure and placement
A green bank can take many forms. Green banks can be newly created entities, or it can be created by repurposing an existing entity. A green bank can be a direct part of government, such as a subdivision of an existing agency. The New York Green Bank, for example, is a division of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).  A green bank can also be a quasi-public instrumentality, such as a wholly owned non-profit public corporation. The Connecticut Green Bank, for example, is a quasi-public entity with both government officials and independent directors serving on its board. A green bank can also an independent non-profit entity administered by the government, either through a contract, or by purpose-building an entity to serve as green bank. The Montgomery County Green Bank, for example, is a non-profit organization that was purpose-built in accordance with legislation and serves as Montgomery County's green bank as a result of a resolution of the County Council.

Sources of capital
Green banks are usually seeded with public capital, and that capital can come from a wide variety of channels. The green bank finance model preserves limited supplies of public capital, allowing each dollar to be recycled continuously and utilized for multiple clean energy projects.

Ratepayer surcharge
A state or local government may place a small surcharge on energy bills within its jurisdiction, and may require that the funds raised by this charge be disbursed to a green bank. Or the government may repurpose an existing surcharge and direct the revenue to a green bank. The surcharge can provide green banks with a yearly influx of capital.  The Connecticut Green Bank and New York Green Bank are capitalized in part by a systems benefit charge.

Bond issuance
Green banks can also issue bonds to obtain capital. Public sector bonds have the benefit of being tax exempt, allowing governments and other public authorities to pay relatively low interest rates to bond owners.  A green bank's bonding authority allows debt investors to secure a steady stream of payments from an institution with a low risk of default. In exchange, the green bank receives capital that it can immediately invest in clean energy deployment.

Types of bonds
Green banks can be capitalized by bond issuances that are backed by state in which the green bank exists. 
Green banks can also be capitalized by issuing bonds that are backed by the green bank itself.  
Green banks can raise capital by issuing project bonds that are backed by the revenue-generating potential of the projects they will fund. Revenue Bonds from a Dedicated Cash Stream
Other bonds backed by a dedicated cash stream (such as ratepayer fees, or by auctions of emissions allowances) can be issued to generate capital for a green bank. 
If a green bank is short on capital, it can securitize loans it has issued (assets) and, through a secondary market, sell them to another investor as a bond. For example, the Connecticut Green Bank sold $30 million in bonds backed by commercial efficiency loans to Clean Fund. 
Industrial revenue bonds and private activity bonds can be issued for certain green bank activities.

Revenue from carbon pricing 
Green banks can also be partially capitalized by the revenue raised from various carbon pricing policies such as carbon taxes, fees, and cap-and-trade systems. For example, both the NYGB and the CGB are capitalized in part by the revenue each state raises through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).

Direct budget appropriation
A government can allocate dollars to a green bank as a part of its regular budget and appropriations process.

Re-allocation of existing funds
Sometimes an existing investment fund will be underused or completely unused. It may be possible to re-allocate some such funds and put the dollars to work in a green bank.

Pension funds
Pension funds can invest in deals or portfolios of deals generated by green banks.

Foundations
Foundations can make grants to green banks to fund startup costs, or they can make program-related investments in green banks and earn a return on their money in a way that is aligned with their mission.

Community development financial institutions
Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) can co-invest or provide startup capital for green banks. CDFIs can also provide important technical expertise in certain areas of green bank activity.

Federal sources in the US
The USDA and its Rural Utilities Service (RUS) program provide funding for infrastructure projects, including energy-related infrastructure, to rural communities.  The RUS has funding available that could be used by green banks to finance projects in rural areas.
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has programs, notably the Loan Program Office (LPO), which provides federal dollars for innovative clean energy companies and project portfolios.  A green bank could take advantage of DOE money by building portfolios of projects designed to meet the standard set out by the LPO.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), a lending program which makes low-cost financing available for various water and energy infrastructure projects. The EPA also has a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a competitive grant program for smaller green banks, which makes available $14 billion to a select few green banks nationwide for a broad variety of decarbonization investments, $6 billion to green banks in low-income and historically disadvantaged communities for similar investments, and $7 billion to state and local energy funds for decentralized solar power in communities with no financing alternatives.

Solar and Energy Loan Fund of St. Lucie County, FL Inc. (SELF) - 2010

SELF was the first local green bank created in America and it is the only non-profit green bank in Florida. St. Lucie County, FL, created SELF in 2010, with seed funding (EECGB) from the U.S. Department of Energy. SELF is a founding member of the American Green Bank Consortium and the only member certified as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) by the U.S. Treasury Department. SELF is also a member of the Opportunity Finance Network (OFN) and one of the first GREEN CDFIs in America. SELF raises low-cost loan capital from bank CRA investors, faith-based organizations, crowdfunding via KIVA.org and CNote, health organizations, Program-Related Investments (PRIs), impact investors, and the U.S. CDFI Fund. As a CDFI, SELF is focused on helping low- and moderate-income (LMI) and underbanked communities with accessible and low-cost capital for energy efficiency, resilience, and solar technologies. With an LMI penetration rate consistently above 70%, SELF has become a national leader on climate equity. SELF was also showcased in Congress as part of the proposed National Climate Bank debate in 2021, and SELF's CFO/CSO, Duanne Andrade, testified as an expert witness before the U.S. Senate and House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Through July 2022, SELF had expanded from one county in Florida to 4 states (FL, GA, AL, and SC) and opened up new satellite programs in St. Petersburg, Tampa, Orlando, Miami and Atlanta. SELF's EZ loans for green homes are unsecured personal loans and their inclusive underwriting policies focus on the applicant's ABILITY TO PAY, not credit scores. SELF has also created new lending programs for Landlords, Land Trusts, and affordable housing developers, and they have now become a one-stop shop for green bank financing.

Connecticut Green Bank
The Connecticut Green Bank (CGB) was established in 2011 and was the first green bank in the United States. It is the most advanced green bank in the nation in terms of deal volume. Connecticut's legislature converted the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, a grant-focused promoter of clean energy investment, into a deployment financing entity. The CGB is quasi-public and its board of directors is composed of both government officials and independent directors.  The CGB is continually capitalized by a systems benefit charge and revenue generated by Connecticut's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) trading program.  The bank also possesses the ability to issue its own bonds based on its balance sheet.

In its first four years of existence, the CGB has stimulated $663.2 million of investment in clean energy projects, three-fourths of which came from the private sector.  The increase in clean energy investment coincided with a huge decline in the number of taxpayer-funded clean energy grants. In effect, the CGB increased clean energy investment while reducing taxpayers’ financial burden.

New York Green Bank
Governor Andrew Cuomo created the largest Green Bank in the nation, NY Green Bank (NYGB), and capitalized it through re-purposed ratepayer surcharges and revenues generated by the issuance of emissions permits.  The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) designed a 5-year capitalization structure with multiple infusions of capital summing to $1 billion. The NYGB is now a fully staffed entity and operates as a wholesale clean energy finance lender (as opposed to Connecticut, which operates more as a retail lender).  Rather than design specific financing products and programs, the NYGB relies on the market to learn what financing is needed.

To date, the NYGB has received over $1 billion in proposals and has an active project pipeline of ~$500 million.  The first set of NYGB investments were announced in the fall of 2015.  The NYGB used $49 million of public capital to leverage $178 million in private capital, achieving a leverage ratio greater that 3:1.

New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC)
NYCEEC was established in 2010 as one of the first green banks in the United States. NYCEEC was initially formed by New York City government with funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In May 2011, NYCEEC began operations as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit. NYCEEC’s mission is to deliver financing solutions and advance markets for energy efficiency and clean energy in buildings, and its vision is energy efficiency and clean energy financing for buildings to achieve scale and be accessible to all.1 

NYCEEC provides loans for energy efficiency, renewable energy, storage, and high performance buildings in NYC and throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. NYCEEC serves multiple real estate sectors: affordable & market rate multifamily, commercial, industrial, and institutional. Most loans made by NYCEEC are located in—or support—low-and-moderate (LMI) income communities.  NYCEEC is also administrator of the NYC Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (NYC C-PACE) Program which launched in 2021.2 As of June 2023, NYCEEC has mobilized over $430 million of capital for energy efficiency and clean energy projects, upgraded over 430 buildings, and greened over 15,000 affordable housing units.3

California CLEEN Center
The California Lending for Energy and Environmental Needs Center operates as the state's green bank. The CLEEN center exists within the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. One of the center's major initiatives—the Statewide Energy Efficiency Program (SWEEP)—finances energy efficiency projects and upgrades for municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals.  Unlike the Connecticut and New York Green Banks, the CLEEN Center exclusively facilitates commercial projects and upgrades. Interested parties propose a project and apply for financial assistance with the CLEEN Center. CLEEN projects receive funding ranging from $500,000 to $30 million.

Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority
The Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority was created in 2014 to finance clean energy development in Hawaii. The first program to be adopted was the Green Energy Market Securitization (GEMS) program—an effort to provide the low-to-moderate income market with solar lease financing.  For geographical reasons, electricity is more expensive in Hawaii than anywhere else in the United States. The advent of solar leasing has allowed many Hawaiian homeowners to install solar panels, but solar market penetration has hardly reached low-credit households.  The cash flow positive financing generated by GEMS is designed to help low-to-moderate income Hawaiians enter a market from which they have historically been excluded.

Rhode Island
In 2015, state legislators converted the Rhode Island Clean Water Finance Agency (RICWFA) into the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank (RIIB).  The RIIB offers both residential and commercial PACE programs designed to reduce energy costs for consumers. The RIIB also created the Efficient Buildings Fund, a program used to provide low-cost financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in public buildings.

Montgomery County, MD
Montgomery County, Maryland is the only county in the U.S. that has created a local green bank.  The Montgomery County Green Bank (MCGB) was capitalized with $20 million from the settlement that accompanied the merger of utilities Pepco and Exelon.

Malaysia
Malaysia's Green Technology Financing Corporation was launched in 2010 as a component of the government's National Green Technology Policy.  Through the Green Technology Financing Scheme, the corporation offers companies a 2% interest rate buy down and 60% guaranteed financing for green technology projects.

United Kingdom
In 2012, the UK government created the UK Green Investment Bank (GIB) to attract private funds for the financing of the private sector's investments related to environmental preservation and improvement. It is structured as a public limited company and is owned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).  Its headquarters are in Edinburgh, where it is also registered, and it has a secondary office in London. The GIB works with a variety of technologies including energy efficiency, waste and bioenergy, offshore wind, and onshore renewables.  UK's GIB has committed £2.6 billion to 76 domestic infrastructure projects, mobilizing over £10 billion of private investment.

In March 2016, the UK government announced that it planned to move the GIB to the private sector. The government plans to sell its shares in the GIB, but will seek to retain a ‘special share’ to ensure the continued protection of GIB's green purposes.

Australia
Australia's Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) was founded in 2012 with the purpose of mobilizing investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low emissions technologies.  At the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the CEFC had invested $1.4 billion of its own capital and attracted $2.2 billion in private sector investment.

Awards and recognition
Isabella Marianne Peggy Wranå (born 22 June 1997) is a Swedish curler. She is a former skip of the Swedish junior women's team, with whom she won a World Junior championship in 2017. In 2018, she was inducted into the Swedish Curling Hall of Fame.

Career

Juniors
Wranå has skipped the Swedish team in four World Junior Curling Championships, in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018. In 2014, she led her team of Jennie Wåhlin, Elin Lövstrand, Fanny Sjöberg and Almida de Val to a fourth-place finish, after they lost in the bronze medal game to Russia. In 2015, she and teammates Wåhlin, Johanna Heldin, Sjöberg and Johanna Höglund again finished fourth after this time losing to Switzerland in the bronze medal game. She was back at it in 2017 when her and teammates Wåhlin, de Val and Sjöberg won the gold medal, defeating Scotland's Sophie Jackson in the final, and lost just two round robin games in the process. The next year the same team went undefeated in the round robin, but ended up losing to Canada's Kaitlyn Jones in the final. This team also represented Sweden at the 2017 Winter Universiade, where they took home the bronze medal.

Women's
As World Junior champions, Wranå qualified for the 2017 Humpty's Champions Cup, her first Grand Slam event. The team did not qualify for the playoffs but did win one game. The team won their first World Curling Tour event at the 2018 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic. A month later, they won the Paf Masters Tour. Over the course of the 2018–19 season, Wranå's team played in four slams, failing to qualify in any of the four. They won one game at the 2018 Tour Challenge, one game at the 2018 National, no games at the 2019 Canadian Open and one game at the 2019 Champions Cup. Also during this season, Wranå skipped her team to a gold medal at the 2019 Winter Universiade.

Team Wranå had a successful 2019–20 season, winning two tour events (the Royal LePage Women's Fall Classic and the Paf Masters Tour once again) and finishing second at the Women's Masters Basel and the Glynhill Ladies International. They played in two slam events, winning one game at both the 2019 Tour Challenge and the 2019 National.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Team Wranå only played in one tour event during the abbreviated 2020–21 season. The team competed at the 2020 Women's Masters Basel, where they missed the playoffs with a 1–2 record. In December, they played Team Hasselborg in the Sweden National Challenge, where they won by a score of 17–12. The Swedish Women's Curling Championship was cancelled due to the pandemic, so Team Hasselborg was named as the Swedish Team for the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship. After the season, longtime lead Fanny Sjöberg stepped back from competitive curling and Maria Larsson joined the team as their new lead.

In their first event of the 2021–22 season, Team Wranå reached the final of the 2021 Euro Super Series where they lost to Rebecca Morrison.

Team Wranå began the 2022–23 Grand Slam season at the 2022 National, where they finished with a 2–2 record in pool play. This put them in a tie-breaker against the newly formed Kaitlyn Lawes, which they lost 7–2. Next up was the 2022 Tour Challenge, where they again went 2–2, putting themselves in another tiebreaker, this time against Hollie Duncan. This time, Team Wranå won, putting them in the playoffs. They then beat the World Champion Silvana Tirinzoni rink in the quarters before losing to Team Rachel Homan in the semifinal. The next Slam was the 2022 Masters, where Wranå led her rink to a 1–3 record, missing the playoffs. The team began the New Year at the 2023 Canadian Open, where they won the A1 event, defeating their clubmates in Team Anna Hasselborg.

Pink Hill is an unincorporated community in Jackson County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. It is located on Pink Hill Road roughly between South Howell Road and South Fields Road.

History
Pink Hill was once a small thriving rural community. The town consisted of 10 acres purchased from R.G. Pinkard, and was recorded with Jackson County, Missouri on November 21, 1854, and recorded as Pink Hill, Missouri.  The town was platted with 40 lots, with two 30 ft wide streets, Main Street and Locust Street, and two alleys 16.5 ft wide.  Pink Hill, Missouri set on the southeast corner of Pink Hill Road and Howell Road.  A post office called Pink Hill was established in 1854, and remained in operation until 1902. There are two conclusions as to how the community received its name.  The first was it was named for a hill near the town site where pink flowers grew. 
The second was the town site was purchased from R. G. Pinkard and may have derived from the Pinkard's name.

The town was established as a rural community, hopeful of sustained development when Chicago and Alton Railroad surveyed this area of Sni-A-Bar township in the 1850s to build a rail line. They were hopeful that the rail line would pass through the community and establish a railroad depot.  Instead of this occurring the Chicago and Alton Railroad laid the rail line 3 miles south, through the communities of Oak Grove and Blue Springs in 1878.  The town was forced to be abandoned during the civil war by the Union army. Most of the homes and businesses were burned after the towns people were forced to leave. After the civil war the town was rebuilt but only small residences were built in place of what used to be grand larger homes.

To take advantage of the commerce that the railroad would bring, the majority of the towns businesses and residents quickly moved to the area known today as Grain Valley, Missouri in 1878.  The residents from Pink Hill, Missouri was instrumental in starting the community of Grain Valley, Missouri.

With the decline of businesses the small town eventually all but disappeared. All that is left today of the community, is in old church, located at 35305 East Pink Hill Road, and of course Pink Hill Road.  The old Pink Hill Church today, is a private residence.

The Adams County Courthouse is a government building in central Quincy, the county seat of Adams County, Illinois, United States. Built in 1950 after a tornado destroyed its predecessor, it is the fourth building to serve as a courthouse for Adams County.

Previous courthouses
Adams County was created by the Legislature in early 1825,and by year's end, the county commissioners had produced specifications for the first courthouse; this structure was a square log building completed in early 1826. Few public buildings being available in Quincy at the time, it was also employed as a school, a church building, and a general meeting space. After ten years of use, it was destroyed by a fire in 1836, and a new brick courthouse was begun, but it too fell prey to fire in 1875. A peaceful county seat war ensued, but Quincy defeated the challenge from Coatsburg by a wide margin, and the county's third courthouse was completed and occupied in 1877.

Current courthouse
Downtown Quincy was severely damaged by an April 1945 tornado, and the 1877 courthouse was one of many buildings destroyed in the storm. A five-year construction process culminated with the dedication of a fourth courthouse in 1950. Two separate architectural firms were involved: Hafner and Hafner oversaw the construction of a design produced by Holabird, Root, and Burgee. Like the second and third courthouses, the fourth is a brick building, although neither the Greek Revival second building similar to the Putnam County Courthouse, nor the Neoclassical third building, at all resembles the modernist fourth building. Three stories tall, the courthouse possesses an unadorned facade that faces a parking area.

Sebipora is a fungal genus in the family Gelatoporiaceae. It was circumscribed in 2012 by mycologist Otto Miettinen to contain the crust fungus Sebipora aquosa, its single species. This fungus is found in low altitudes in Sumatra and New Guinea, where it causes a white rot on dead angiosperm wood, particularly fallen tree trunks, and frequently on burned wood.

Sebipora aquosa has a monomitic hyphal system (containing only generative hyphae), and thin-walled, cylindrical spores measuring 5.7–7.6 by 2.1–2.7 μm and containing one or two oil drops. Cystidia and cystidioles are absent from the hymenium.

The binomial name, which combines the Latin words sebum ("tallow") and aquosus ("watery"), refers to the appearance of fresh fruit bodies. Sebiporia is grouped in the Cinereomyces clade. This clade, which groups phylogenetically outside of the "core polyporoid clade", contains the related genera Gelatoporia, Obba, and Cinereomyces. The genus was formally transferred to the new family Gelatoporiaceae in 2017.

Ella Mai Howell (born 3 November 1994) is an English singer and songwriter. Her musical career began at London's British and Irish Modern Music Institute in 2014, during which time she auditioned as part of a trio on the 11th season of The X Factor. In 2015, she uploaded a four-track solo EP of originals to SoundCloud titled Troubled, and was discovered on social media by American record producer Mustard and signed with his record label, 10 Summers Records.

From 2016 to 2018, she released three EPs on the label, including Time, Change, and Ready. Her self-titled debut studio album was released in October 2018 and featured the singles "Boo'd Up" and "Trip", which charted in the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 5 and 11, respectively. In 2019, "Boo'd Up" was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Song of the Year and Best R&B Song, winning for the latter, as well as Mai herself being nominated for British Breakthrough Act at the 2019 Brit Awards. At the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, she won three awards, including the award for Top R&B Artist.

Early life and education
Ella Mai was born on 3 November 1994 to a Jamaican mother and an English-Irish father in London. Her mother, a lover of American jazz music, named her after Ella Fitzgerald. Mai moved from London to New York City at the age of 12 when her mother took on a teaching job there. Mai's transition to life in New York City was difficult because she was often bullied for her accent. Mai graduated from Queens High School of Teaching in Glen Oaks, Queens, before returning to England aged 17. She is a fan of Arsenal F.C. and club's legend Thierry Henry.

Career
Ella Mai's singing career began studying at the British and Irish Modern Music Institute London (BIMM London) in 2014. During that time she competed on series 11 of The X Factor as part of a trio, 'Arize', but didn't advance beyond the initial audition for the judges. The group broke up shortly thereafter.

2015–2019: Self-titled debut album
In 2015, Mai uploaded a four-track solo EP of original recorded songs to SoundCloud titled Troubled which was produced by Ella’s high school friend Kyle Dj Kam1 McCullough.. Shortly after the release of Troubled, Mai was discovered on Instagram and signed to DJ Mustard's label, 10 Summers Records and Interscope Records. In February 2016, she released Time, the first in her EP trilogy. The six-track EP included the single "She Don't", which featured Ty Dolla Sign. She released her second EP, Change, in November 2016 and third, Ready, in February 2017. "Boo'd Up", which was featured on the EP, rose in popularity on social media as well as in nightclubs over the next few months. Ella Mai toured with Kehlani on her SweetSexySavage World Tour. After Mai served as the opening act on Kehlani's tour, her music reached a bigger audience and the song grew on radio airplay in the spring of 2018.

On 26 April 2018, she released a music video for "Boo'd Up" after it started to gain popularity. The song became her first top ten song in the US in the following month, deeming it her "breakthrough hit." Rolling Stone wrote that the single is "one of the biggest singles by a breakout female R&B singer in the past 10 years." The single peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, and broke the record for the most weeks at number one of any song by a woman on the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. On 14 August, she joined Bruno Mars on the 24K Magic World Tour after Cardi B dropped out.

On 3 August, she released the single "Trip", with an accompanied music video releasing on 18 September. The song peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. Ella Mai released her self-titled debut album, a 16-track set featuring "Boo'd Up", on 12 October 2018, with guest appearances from Chris Brown, John Legend, and H.E.R. The album sold 69,000 album-equivalent units with 17,000 coming from pure sales. On 22 October 2018, Mai announced her debut tour set to begin in January 2019.
In November, she made two guest appearances on JID's song "Tiiied", along with 6lack and on Meek Mill's song "24/7", on the albums Dicapiro 2 and Championships respectively. On 18 November, she performed on Saturday Night Live with Jezebel describing Mai as "Pure '90s R&B Heartthrob".

Mai was also nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best R&B Song and Song of the Year with "Boo'd Up", winning for the former. "Boo'd Up" would go onto to win the 2019 Billboard Music Award for Top R&B Song. In 2019, Mai won the Billboard Music Awards for Top R&B Artist and Top Female R&B Artist.
Apart from her music, Mai also performed a sketch on Nickelodeon's All That (which aired on 27 July 2019) called "Boo'd Up", a paranormal parody of The Dating Game, in which she played herself as a contestant looking for a ghost to haunt her family home, but instead of choosing the three suitors offered, she chose her former ghost who came back and she forgave him.

2020–present: Heart on My Sleeve
In 2020, Mai received her third nomination for the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album for her self-titled debut at the 62nd Grammy Awards.

On 2 October 2020, Mai released the single, "Not Another Love Song". On Friday, 28 January 2022, she released "DFMU". On 28 March 2022 Mai announced the title of her second studio album Heart on My Sleeve which was released on 6 May 2022. the album debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200 making it her second top 20 on the chart.

Artistry
In multiple interviews, Ella Mai names Lauryn Hill, Chris Brown, Brandy, Destiny's Child, Alicia Keys, and Mariah Carey as her biggest influences. Vibe said her "perception of the powerful emotion is kindred to R&B heartthrobs of the '90s, who flooded the radio airwaves with soulful ballads, baby-making tunes, and heart-wrenching break-up anthems." Rolling Stone described her sound as "a British émigré full of self-confidence and an affinity for classic Nineties R&B."

Peter Ulric Tse (born Oct. 28, 1962) is an American cognitive neuroscientist in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College. He directs the NSF EPSCoR Attention Consortium. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014.

Early life and education 

Tse, who has German and Chinese heritage, grew up in New York City. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1984, studying physics and mathematics. After graduating from Dartmouth, he worked for the Peace Corps as a schoolteacher in Nepal but E.T.’d (left before his service was through), then studied philosophy of mind at the University of Konstanz, Germany, and worked for Kobe Steel Corporation in Japan. He began his studies at Harvard University in 1992, receiving his PhD in cognitive psychology under Patrick Cavanagh and Ken Nakayama in 1998. Tse served as a postdoctoral researcher with Nikos Logothetis at the Max Plank Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Germany. He joined Dartmouth's faculty in 2001.

Cognitive neuroscience 

The focus of Tse's work in cognitive neuroscience is mid- and high-level human vision. In the domain of mid-level vision his group has worked on deciphering the rapid form-motion computations that go into the construction of subsequent conscious visual experience. His group focuses on visual illusions because they are mistakes made by the visual system that can inform us about the nature of processing that goes into the construction of conscious experience.

In the field of high-level vision and attention, Tse's group has focused on two main directions: the influence of top-down volitional operations on visual experience, and the nature of volitional mental operations that go into the construction of internal virtual experience or imagination.

In his work on the neural basis of the human imagination, he has emphasized the importance of volitional and non-volitional verb-like mental operations over noun-like representations, such as imagined visual objects. Using fMRI, his group has argued that representations and operations can be decoded by creating classifiers in one part of the brain, and applying them to different parts of the brain. This supports the idea that the brain might not be as modular as previously thought, and that certain types of brain processing may happen in a fundamentally distributed manner. In particular, the model of working memory operations that emerges suggests that traditional models of working memory, such as Baddeley's, are too modular and hierarchical.

Philosophy of neuroscience 
In his 2013 book The Neural Basis of Free Will, Tse focused on the question of mental causation, in particular the proposition that mental events (and information in general, as in genetics) can be downwardly causal even though realized in, or supervenient upon, physical events.

Exclusion argument: He challenged the Exclusion Argument (EA) of Jaegwon Kim, according to which causal efficacy resides solely in the physical domain of the rootmost level of energy, by arguing that the EA does not hold if indeterminism is the case. This, he argues, provides an opening for information to be downwardly causal in the universe, whether high-level supervenient events such as conscious percepts or a concept, such as that of a 'home-run' in a baseball game, or 'voting' in a democracy. Information is downwardly causal, not as a force, he argues, but by filtering out possible paths that are open at the particle level which are not consistent with informational criteria. Under 'criterial causation' (see below) only physically causal paths which are also informational causal paths are permitted to occur in the nervous system and other information processing systems, such as underlie genetic inheritance, protein formation, membrane channel formation, or social interactions such as speaking or institutional interactions. Possible physical particle-level paths which do not meet high-level informational criteria are effectively filtered out by a criterial assessment. Thus information is causal, not as a force, or via attributes such as impact or force, but is causal as a filter on what possibilities can become real.

Criterial causation: Tse gets around the impossibility of self-causation (i.e. of informational events altering their own physical basis) by positing what he has variously called 'parameter-,' 'pattern-,' 'phase-' or 'criterial causation'. According to Tse, Science and Philosophy have overly focused on 'active' modes of causation, such as Newtonian energy transfer among billiard balls. He points out that manipulationist and interventionist conceptions of causation, such as those of Woodward, have largely neglected the 'passive' causal efficacy of manipulations of parameters for responses to subsequent inputs. For example, a neuron tuned to 'dog' at one moment can be reparameterized to respond optimally to 'cat' in subsequent input by altering the chains of synaptic weights that feed driving input into that neuron.

The neural code: Tse argues that thinking of the neural code as one where neural spikes trigger neural spikes, much like billiard balls triggering motion in other billiard balls, is misleading and incomplete. He argues that the neural code is in fact as much a synaptic reweighting (i.e. informational reparameterization) code as it is a code based on neural spikes or action potentials.

Tse argues that criterial causation offers a middle path between the extremes of determinism, where one's decisions and their consequences were 'set in stone' ages before one was even born, and informationally unconstrained indeterminism, where decisions happen randomly, for no reason at all. He argues that David Hume was wrong when he wrote "tis impossible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an absolute necessity." The middle path between the two is afforded by criterial causation. For example, if commanded to think of a woman politician, people will name whichever one comes to mind first. But if the universe could be rewound to the moment of the command, they might have generated a different name, say 'Margaret Thatcher' this time instead of 'Angela Merkel'. This was not utterly random, since it had to meet the criteria of being a woman and a politician, but it was also not determined, and might have turned out otherwise.

Free will: Tse argues that discussants often argue past each other because they have different underlying definitions of the term 'free will'. If one has (1) a 'low-octane' definition according to which one's decisions and intentions can influence one's subsequent actions uncoerced by external forces or intentions, one can believe that free will is compatible with determinism, because nowhere in this definition is it required that events have the possibility of turning out otherwise. However, if one has a (2) 'mid-octane' definition, where this requirement must be met, then, by definition, one must hold that free will is incompatible with determinism, where there is only one possible unfolding of events. One must also be an incompatibilist under (3) a 'high-octane' definition of free will, which Tse also terms 'metafree will', according to which one must have the capacity not only to choose among possible courses of action as in (2), but to choose among possibilities that entail becoming a different kind of chooser in the future. Tse argues that the human brain realizes both types (3) and (2) free will, whereas other animals, such as a tiger, realize type (2) only. As such, Tse is an incompatibilist regarding definitions (2) and (3), and a compatibilist regarding definition (1). He believes indeterminism is the case, so falls in the camp of Free Will Libertarianism along with philosophers such as Robert Kane. For example, a tiger seeing a tapir in the Sumatran jungle can internally weigh various possible paths toward capturing the tapir given criteria such as path and effort minimization and stealth maximization. But no tiger thinks to itself, "next year I want to become a different kind of tiger, one that eats fewer tapirs and more pangolins." A human, in contrast, can envision future possible selves, weigh their merits, and then choose to become a desired self, and with effort realize such a self. For example, a person may desire to learn a foreign language, envision learning numerous possible foreign languages, deliberate among them, weighing various pros and cons, and then select, say, 'Swahili'. After a year of hard work, a person can have transformed their nervous system into a new type of nervous system and mind, namely, one that can now process Swahili inputs and produce Swahili outputs. As such, Tse views the human imagination to be the central engine of free will, when combined with the physical and motivational wherewithal to realize imagined futures.

In contrast, he has argued that the Libet experiments (where preceding brain activity can be used to decode picking this versus that option, such as turning left versus right, or the timing of an event, such as a finger motion, before a person becomes conscious of willing) are largely irrelevant to free will, because free will is rooted in imaginative deliberation and choosing, not picking among arbitrary and meaningless alternatives. Libet's picking paradigm also misses the fundamental importance of willpower in realizing envisioned future paths or future selves, where, for example, a person can envision numerous possible flying machines, but then must also have the determination and perseverance to build that machine, and thereby transform the world, as the Wright brothers did. Similarly, he has dismissed Wegner's claims that there is no free will with the statement, "Just as the existence of visual illusions does not prove that all vision is illusory, the existence of illusions of conscious agency does not prove that conscious operations cannot be causal of action in certain cases."

The Rapson Creek Formation is a geologic formation in Michigan. It preserves fossils dating back to the Silurian period.
Fragiliporia is the sole genus in the fungus family Fragiliporiaceae. It contains the poroid crust fungus Fragiliporia fragilis, described as new to science by Chinese mycologists in 2014. The type specimen of this fungus was discovered growing on a rotting stump of alder in the Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve in Yunnan. The specific epithet fragilis refers to the brittle fruit bodies of the fungus. Molecular phylogenetics shows that the fungus is in an isolated position in the Polyporales, distinct from the six previously identified clades in this order. In a later study (2017), Fragiliporia was recovered in a phylogenetically isolated position as sister to Candelabrochaete africana.

Description
Fragiliporia fragilis is a white rot fungus with soft fruit bodies that become powdery and brittle when bruised. It measures up to  long by  wide by  thick at its centre. It has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae that have clamp connections. Its spores are sausage-shaped (allantoid), thin-walled, and hyaline, typically measuring 4.8–5.4 by 1.7–2 μm.
Fibroporia albicans is a species of poroid crust fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae. It causes a brown rot. The fungus was described in 2015 as a species new to science, based on collections made in Jiangxi and Xizang Provinces, China. It is one of five Fibroporia species recorded in China.

Description
Fibroporia albicans is characterized by crust-like, annual fruit bodies with a white to cream-colored fresh pore surface that darkens to cream or cream-buff after drying. The pores are small, measuring 6–8 per millimeter, and there are white to cream rhizomorphs.

Gaius Calpurnius Flaccus was a Roman senator of the second century. He was attested suffect consul with Lucius Trebius Germanus as his colleague on 15 December of an undetermined year between 122 and 127. Both Flaccus and Germanus are primarily known from inscriptions.

Géza Alföldy has suggested that Flaccus might be the son of a Calpurnius Flaccus, to whom Pliny the Younger wrote a short and chatty letter. Alföldy identified the son with another Gaius Calpurnius Flaccus, known from an inscription, who was flamen provinciae Hispaniae about the time of Hadrian's visit to Tarraco.

The cursus honorum of Flaccus is imperfectly known from an inscription from Salamis. His first known office was as legatus legionis or commander of a Roman legion in the Rhine provinces with "Augustus" in its name; Alföldy argues that Flaccus was legatus more likely of Legio II Augusta than Legio VIII Augusta, since no legates of the second unit are known to have gone on to govern provinces after the Flavian dynasty. Next Flaccus was governor of a province whose name begins with the letters "Lu" -- either Lusitania or Gallia Lugdunensis -- from the year 119 to 121. This was followed a few years later as governor of Cyprus in 122/123, after which he acceded to the consulate.

Flaccus' life is unrecorded after his consulate.

Appearances
Scutiger wuguanfui is a species of toad in the family Megophryidae. It is endemic to Tibet and only known from its type locality in the Medog County. The specific name wuguanfui honours Wu Guanfu, a Chinese herpetologist. Common names Wu's lazy toad, Medog lazy toad and Medog cat-eyed toad have been coined for it.

Description
Adult males measure  and adult females, based on a single specimen only,  in snout–vent length. The body is stout and the head is large. There is no tympanum, but the supratympanic fold is distinct. The forelimbs are comparatively long. The fingers have rounded tips and are free of webbing. The hind limbs are comparatively short. The toes have rounded tips and weakly developed dermal fringes and webbing. Skin is rough. The dorsum is dark brown, becoming lighter on the flanks. The loreal real region as well as the supratympanic fold are brownish-black. The lips are light brown. The belly is grayish-brown. Males have a single internal subgular vocal sac.

The male advertisement call is a loud, toneless croaking like "ong...ong...ong...".

Habitat and conservation
The type series was collected in a sluggish stream in mixed broadleaf–conifer forest at an elevation of  above sea level. Individuals were hiding under the logs in daytime but became active after sundown, squatting on leaf litter or peering from under the fallen trees. Males call throughout the night, sometimes even in the afternoon.

As of late 2018, this species had not been included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

It closed with the closure of the Colac to Beech Forest section of the line in 1962.

Today all that remains is the original water tank. A portion of the railway reservation is now part of the Old Beechy Rail Trail.

Danish-language surnamesThe 2017 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 34th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2017 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on November 4, 2017, at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California with a purse of $6,000,000. It was expected to be a showdown between the top two horses in North America, Gun Runner and Arrogate, with several other Grade/Group 1 winners providing additional depth in an 11 horse field. However, Arrogate broke poorly and was never a factor in the race. Gun Runner led for most of the race and scored a comfortable victory, likely wrapping up Horse of the Year honors.

The Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:
Northern Hemisphere three-year-olds: 122 lb
Southern Hemisphere three-year-olds: 117 lb
Four-year-olds and up: 126 lb
Any fillies or mares receive a 3 lb allowance

Contenders
The 2017 Classic was the final encounter between Arrogate, who won the 2016 Classic, and Gun Runner. Arrogate beat Gun Runner in the 2017 Dubai World Cup in an outstanding performance that made him the world's top ranked racehorse. After returning to North America, Arrogate finished a distant fourth in the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack, leaving questions about whether he liked the surface or if he was no longer at peak ability. He then finished second in the Pacific Classic and trainer Bob Baffert decided to train the colt up to the Classic – a layoff of over two months.

By contrast, Gun Runner had steadily improved in the summer of 2017, easily winning both the Stephen Foster Handicap and Whitney Stakes. In his final prep for the Classic, he won the Woodward Stakes by  lengths. Based on these strong performances, Gun Runner was made the slight morning-line favorite for the Classic at 9–5, with Arrogate at 2–1. One question mark was that Gun Runner had never won at the distance of 10 furlongs.

Other leading contenders included:
 Collected, who defeated Arrogate in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar while leading wire-to-wire
 West Coast, winner of the Travers Stakes
 Mubtaahij, winner of the Jockey Club Gold Cup

In the post position draw held on October 30, Arrogate drew post 1 on the rail. To avoid getting trapped in traffic, jockey Mike Smith announced that he would ride the colt aggressively from the starting gate. Gun Runner drew the more favorable post position 5.

Trainer Bob Baffert had a record four horses in the field – Arrogate, Collected, West Coast and Mubtaahij – all of whom were given strong chances to win. Baffert said of Gun Runner, "He's the only thing between me and a big, fat check." Baffert had won the Classic three years in a row with Bayern, American Pharoah and Arrogate.

Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien had two entries, Churchill and War Decree, neither of which has previously raced on the dirt. Churchill, a dual classic winner at a mile, was given the best chance of the two. "He is very like Giant's Causeway", said O'Brien. "He is miler that you would like to think will get a mile and a quarter."

Race Description
Gun Runner broke well and quickly moved up to the lead with Collected pressing him on the outside. Gun Runner ran a fast opening quarter, then moved easily around the first turn and down the backstretch as jockey Florent Geroux kept him on a loose rein. Rounding the final turn, Collected closed ground and the two were head-and-head with a quarter of a mile remaining. Entering the stretch, Gun Runner responded to the challenge and pulled away, winning by  lengths. Collected held on for second while West Coast was third.

Gun Runner's win came against an apparent track bias: in most other races that week at Del Mar, races had been won by horses that raced off the rail and came from behind. "My horse was very comfortable right there, and flopping his ear back and forth", said Geroux. "I just tried to keep him as happy as I could."

By contrast, Arrogate ducked in at the start and lost over 11 lengths to Gun Runner during the first quarter mile. Never a factor in the race, he made a mild rally in the stretch to finish in a dead heat for fifth place with Gunnevera. "He just can't find the plate", said Baffert. "I hate to make excuses for the big horse, but he's just not the horse he was."

The performance solidified Gun Runner's bid for American Horse of the Year honors, based on his record of five wins and a second from six starts during 2017.

Gilbert-Amable Faure-Conac, (5 April 1755 – 14 February 1819), was an officer of the French Navy and politician for the department of Creuse in the late eighteenth century.

Life 
Born the son of Jean-Baptiste Faure, of Fournoux, and Marguerite Rochon, Faure-Conac volunteered for naval service in 1778, serving for three campaigns on Argus, the corvette Sylphide and the frigate Pourvoyeuse, and became sub-lieutenant under Admiral Suffren in the squadron sent to operate against British India during the American Revolutionary War.

He later became naval commander at Pontarion, and after the French Revolution the administrator for Creuse. On 7 September 1792 he was elected by plurality as the alternate deputy to represent Creuse at the National Convention. After the death of Jean-François Guyès, he took his seat on 25 frimaire an II (15 December 1793), where he was occupied exclusively with naval issues, voting to postpone the indictment against Minister of the Navy Jean de Lacoste. By the decree of 30 thermidor an II (17 August 1794), Faure-Conac was sent on a mission with Bernard Thomas Tréhouart to the ports of Brest and Lorient, for which the committee of inspectors allocated 6000 livres on (18 August 1794).

During this mission, they learned from the authorities of Bergen in Norway that French sailors had helped to extinguish a major fire in the city. On 20 frimaire an III (10 December 1794), with his colleague, Faure-Conac sent to the Committee of Public Safety, the 171 decrees made during their trip, which were then redistributed to other committees. Recalled by the degree of 2 ventôse an III (20 February 1795), he was replaced by Julien-François Palasne de Champeaux and Jean-Nicolas Topsent. At the convention, he opposed the plan by Marie-Benoît-Louis Gouly regarding the reorganisation of naval artillery.

Elected by the same department for the Conseil des Cinq-Cents on 21 vendémiaire an IV (13 October 1795) by 151 votes from 218 voters, Faure-Conac was promoted to captain on 22 September 1796, as commander of the frigate Bravoure. On 8 ventôse an V (26 February 1797) he resigned his political position to serve in the Navy. Between 1799 and 1809, he commanded Indivisible, Bravoure, Constitution, and Cassard. On 4 January 1811, he was named commandant of the École de marine de Brest, on board the school-ship Tourville until 1814.

He was made an honorary contre-amiral on 1 January 1816 and retired to Chénérailles.

Maopūtasi County is located in the Eastern District of Tutuila Island in American Samoa. Maʻopūtasi County comprises the capital of Pago Pago and its harbor, as well as surrounding villages. It was home to 11,695 residents as of 2000. Maʻopūtasi County is  The county has a  shoreline which includes Pago Pago Bay.

Maopūtasi County makes up all villages in the Pago Pago Bay Area from Aua to Fatumafuti. Besides Pago Pago, it is home to the following villages: Anua (2010 pop. 18), Atu’u (pop. 359), Aua (pop. 2,077), Faga'alu (pop. 910), Fagatogo (pop. 1,737), Fatumafuti (pop. 113), Leloaloa (pop. 448), Satala (pop. 297), and Utulei (pop. 684).

Maopūtasi translates to “the only house of chiefs”. Pago Pago has been called O le Maputasi ("The Single Chief’s House") in compliment to the Mauga, who lived at Gagamoe and was the senior to all the other chiefs in the area.

The county is represented by three senators in the American Samoa Senate, and five representatives in the House of Representatives, more than any other county. Following the 2018 midterm elections, the county is currently represented by the following five members in the House of Representatives: Vailoata Eteuati Amituana’i, Vailiuama Steve Leasiolagi, Vesiai Poyer Samuelu, Vaetasi Tuumolimoli Moliga, and Faimealelei Anthony Allen.

History

In the summer of 1892, a disturbance broke out around Pago Pago Bay due to local rivalries. Mauga Lei chose to spend most of his time in Upolu Island, leaving the Pago Pago area without its natural leadership. The village of Pago Pago remained loyal, but neighboring Fagatogo joined with Aua village in an attempt to oust Mauga Lei in favor of a new titleholder. Pago Pago and the transmontane village of Fagasa demanded and received the surrender of the pretender. Fagatogans and Auans embarked in their boats and set out for Pago Pago, and when they were closing in on the village, they were met by bullets and forced to retreat. Houses were burned in Aua and Fagatogo, and women and children from Aua took refuge at the Roman Catholic Mission at Lepua.

Following the death of elder statesman Mauga Moi Moi in 1935, the high chiefly title became vacant along with the county's chieftainship and the district's governorship. When the Mauga aiga could not agree upon a successor, the Governor had to fill administrative posts and named High Chief Lei’ato to be the district's governor. He decided to try free, “American-style” elections for the post of county chief, however, Aua village declined to take any part in such proceedings. In the fa'aSāmoa, Utulei and Fagatogo villages voted for the Mailo, but each of the other county villages voted for its own village chiefs. Five years later, when the Mauga aiga chose Sialega Palepoi to be their matai, and hence High Chief of Maputasi County, the county chieftainship passed naturally into his hands.

The 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami did major structural damage to the port facility in Fagatogo and elsewhere in the county.

Demographics

Ma'oputasi County was first recorded beginning with the 1912 special census. Regular decennial censuses were taken beginning in 1920. From 1912–1970, it was reported as "Mauputasi County."

With the exception of Fatumafuti village, Maʻopūtasi County as a whole and all its villages experienced a population decline from 2000–2010. In 2010, the county was home to 10,299 residents, down from 11,695 recorded at the 2000 U.S. Census. Pago Pago’s population decreased 14.5 percent, Fagatogo’s population by 17.1 percent, and Utulei’s population by 15.2 percent. The population of the Eastern District decreased from 23,441 residents recorded at the 2000 U.S. Census, down to 23,030 residents as of the 2010 U.S. Census.

Maʻopūtasi County had a 2015 population of 11,052 residents, according to the 2015 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) by the Commerce Department. It is the second-most populated county (after Tualauta County) and was home to 1,999 housing units as of the 2010 U.S. Census, down from 2,031 recorded at the 2000 U.S. Census. It had the second-highest number of registered voters in 2016, only surpassed by Tualauta County. However, during the 2016 elections, more votes were cast in Maʻopūtasi County than any other county. There were 3,507 registered voters in Maʻopūtasi County as of 2016: 1,911 females and 1,596 males.

Tehipite Valley, a glacial valley of the Middle Fork Kings River, is located in Kings Canyon National Park in the Sierra Nevada of California. The valley is in Fresno County about  southwest of Bishop and  east of Fresno and is known for its Yosemite-like scenery and its extreme isolation.

Geography
The valley, about  long and up to three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) wide, is characterized by high, extremely steep granite walls, side canyons and waterfalls. The valley's scenery has been frequently compared to that of Yosemite Valley, starting with John Muir who first visited the area in the 1870s. It is situated just inside the western boundary of Kings Canyon National Park and on the northern edge of the Monarch Wilderness. The Middle Fork flows swiftly from northeast to southwest through the valley. The valley floor is at an elevation of  while the surrounding peaks rise to heights of  or more.

On a 1917 National Park Service expedition to Tehipite Valley, Robert Sterling Yard described the place as thus:

The north side of Tehipite Valley is dominated by Tehipite Dome, the largest granite dome in the Sierra Nevada, rising  above the valley floor. Notable features of the valley include Silver Spray and Blue Canyon Falls, both cascades hundreds of feet high and the rugged, nearly inaccessible Gorge of Despair formed by Crystal Creek which provides "some of the finest technical rock climbing in the Sierra".

History
The valley was named in 1869 by Frank Dusy, taking the Native American name for Tehipite Dome meaning "high rock". Dusy's expeditions were also the first to photograph the valley, doing so in 1879. Although Dusy is credited with being the first non-native person to visit the valley, he recorded in his journal that he followed a trail possibly used by prospectors in search of gold, several years earlier. Lilbourne A. Winchell, a member of the 1879 Dusy expedition, wrote of his initial impression of the valley:

In 1897 Theodore S. Solomon made one of the first maps of the valley, on which was also the first recorded mention of "Gorge of Despair".

In the 1920s the City of Los Angeles proposed the Tehipite Valley as the site of a hydroelectric dam. This was one of the key controversies before, and for many years after the establishment of Kings Canyon National Park. The initial dedication of the park on March 4, 1940 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not include Tehipite Valley; it was not until 1965 when Tehipite Valley and Cedar Grove were finally added to the park, making them forever off-limits to industrial development.

Access
The valley is known for its extreme remoteness, and is many miles from the nearest paved road (Highway 180). On some days, it receives no visitors at all. One of the major trails to the valley is the Tehipite Valley Trail, which begins at the access road for Wishon Dam. The National Park Service describes the hike to the valley rim as "moderate" and the descent into the valley as "very strenuous". Due to the high elevation of the incoming trails and heavy snows in winter, Tehipite Valley is inaccessible for up to eight months of the year. The difficulty of access is compounded by the fact that many trails have deteriorated. In addition the area is known for rattlesnakes.

There are primitive campsites in the valley, along the Middle Fork.
Fall Spectacular was the name of a major professional wrestling event produced by Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) usually held in the month of September. It was considered to be one of the four major shows of FMW, alongside FMW Anniversary Show, Summer Spectacular and Year End Spectacular. The event was first used as a subtitle for the FMW 2nd Anniversary Show in 1991 and the FMW 3rd Anniversary Show in 1992 as both events took place in the month of September. This title would be re-used with the subtitle "Kawasaki Legend" in 1997 before FMW discontinued the use of these events as it began producing pay-per-view events in 1998.

Jessie was a town in the Australian state of South Australia whose site is located about  south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about  east of the former municipal seat of Naracoorte at the border with the state of Victoria.

It was in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Jessie on land with an estimated area of .  Upon the proclamation of the District Councils Act 1887 on 9 December 1887, it was located within the jurisdiction of the District Council of Narracoorte.

The source of the town’s name is not reported in official sources.  An article in The Narracoorte Herald of 22 February 1929 does offer two possible opinions to the sources of the town’s name.  The first was that "many South-Eastern people thought it was named after a sister of the late Mr. J. P. D. Laurie" who may have had "some influence with the Crown Lands Department" in respect to its name.  The second was that it was named after "some other lady" on the basis of the views of "some other historians of nomenclature."  This lady could be Lady Jessie Blyth for whom the Hundred of Jessie was named.  Lady Blyth was the wife of Sir Arthur Blyth, Commissioner of Crown Land and a former Premier of South Australia when the Hundred was proclaimed on 24 October 1867.

Jessie is reported as being proclaimed on 28 April 1876 by one source while official sources such as the South Australian Government Gazette contain no mention of any proclamation.  However, the government gazette does show that land within the town was available for purchase by November 1870 at the latest.  A drawing of the Hundred of Jessie prepared in November 1872 by the surveyor-general’s office shows that the town had been located and that a layout of its allotments and streets had been prepared.  The town is reported as being surveyed during May 1890.  In September 1891, during the second reading of The Park Lands Resumption Bill in the South Australian House of Assembly, it was stated that the town allotments in the Town of Jessie all remained unsold and that there were "no occupants on town lots" while the "suburban lands" had been "nearly all sold."

On 24 January 1929, the town was declared by a proclamation under the Crown Lands Act 1915 to "ceased to exist" along with the closure of all roads within its boundaries.

On 12 April 2001, the site of the ceased town was divided along the alignment of the Wimmera Highway with its north and south sides being allocated respectively to the newly created localities of Hynam and Laurie Park.

Ines G. Županov (born 1955) is a Croatian historian and Indologist. She is a director of the Centre d’études de l’Inde et de l’Asie du Sud and senior research fellow at the CNRS, Paris.

She is known for her investigation of Christian and Hindu religious interactions in South Asia. In particular, she has researched the Jesuit missions in Portuguese India, their efforts to translate religious texts into local languages and the resultant linguistic and social transformations of the Indians.

Life
Ines G. Županov was born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, in 1955. She graduated from the University of Zagreb with a degree in comparative literature and Indology in 1979. Her master's (1986) and doctoral degrees (1991) were from the University of California, Berkeley. She is based in Paris, but she has lived successively in Zagreb, Mumbai, Berkeley, Dakar, London, Pondicherry, Berlin, Bochum and currently resides in New Delhi.

Research

Evangelism in India
Županov has suggested that Portuguese missionaries felt that there was an intrinsic geographical character to India that resisted evangelism and led to paganism. This resistance also contaminated European Christians and caused the meanings of the gospels to be inverted.

She showed that 16th century Jesuit missions in India adopted a calibrated approach to the conversion of Indians to Christianity. Instead of a complete conversion to "European" Christianity, they first translated, with Indian interpreters, key texts into local languages. They abandoned an insistence on proselytising and sermonising in Portuguese, instead encouraging the administration of sacraments in Tamil. This established a society of Indian believers who were then able to organise and fund religious charities and practices, thereby indigenising the faith. Ironically, the translation of Christian works into Tamil by the Jesuits and their interpreters included the rejection of colonial policies. The Jesuits' efforts caused a gradual revolt against the Portuguese language and, eventually, against Portuguese Christian domination.

One of the "accommodative" Jesuit missions was that of Roberto de Nobili, whose evangelism extended deep into the Tamil country. Among his efforts was the attempt to remove the stigmatic name Parangi given by the Tamilians to the Europeans and their converts, a word that originated from farangi (meaning "foreign") but also given to low-caste people for their habit of drinking alcohol. While the Jesuits strove to evangelise on the basis of "kinship, friendship, and locality", they did so by hiding Hindu signs within Christian ones; Nobili went further by pretending that Hindu rites were secular and thus not a religious threat to a converted Christian. However, this caused consternation in the Catholic church's hierarchy in Europe, which feared that the Indian Catholicism was becoming contaminated. Initially, such accommodative practices were approved by the Church, but were outlawed on the basis of sacrilege in 1703.

Tamil linguistics
Jesuit missionaries began to make close investigations of south Indian languages in the sixteenth century. They determined that Tamil fitted sufficiently into the Latin and Greek linguistic model such that they were able to analyse and teach it using their standard methodology. The Cartilha, published in 1554, compared the syntactic structures of Portuguese and Tamil. The authors found that Tamil was distant enough from the Classical languages that, according to Županov, the Portuguese consigned it and Tamil culture to a "barbarian" (or uncivilised) state, with an impoverished vocabulary. This view has been countered by others, suggesting that "outlandish" or "exotic" might be a better interpretation, as even dialectical differences from the standard were often called "barbarous".

By 1717, however, the Protestant evangelist and linguist Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg was to claim Tamil was peculiar, in the sense of distinctive, because its grammatical conjugation and declension was regular, and in terms of vocabulary, on par with Latin. This corresponds to Županov's assessment of another Jesuit, Henrique Henriques, who had compiled a Tamil grammar Arte da Lingua Malabar in 1549.

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is a free trade area encompassing most of Africa. It was established in 2018 by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, which has 43 parties and another 11 signatories, making it the largest free-trade area by number of member states, after the World Trade Organization, and the largest in population and geographic size, spanning 1.3 billion people across the world's second largest continent.

The agreement founding AfCFTA was brokered by the African Union (AU) and signed by 44 of its 55 member states in Kigali, Rwanda on 21 March 2018.  The proposal was set to come into force 30 days after ratification by 22 of the signatory states. On 29 April 2019, the Saharawi Republic made the 22nd deposit of instruments of ratification, bringing the agreement into force on May 30; it entered its operational phase following a summit on 7 July 2019, and officially commenced 1 January 2021. AfCFTA's negotiations and implementation are overseen by a permanent secretariat based in Accra, Ghana.

Under the agreement, AfCFTA members are committed to eliminating tariffs on most goods and services over a period of 5, 10, or 13 years, depending on the country's level of development or the nature of the products. General long-term objectives include creating a single, liberalised market; reducing barriers to capital and labor to facilitate investment; developing regional infrastructure; and establishing a continental customs union. The overall aims of AfCFTA are to increase socioeconomic development, reduce poverty, and make Africa more competitive in the global economy.

The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa estimates that AfCFTA will boost intra-African trade by 52 percent by 2022. A report by the World Bank anticipates that AfCFTA could lift 30 million Africans out of extreme poverty, boost the incomes of nearly 70 million people, and generate $450 billion in income by 2035. On January 13, 2022, the AfCFTA took a major step towards its objective with the establishment of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which allows payments among companies operating in Africa to be done in any local currency.

History

Background
In 1963, the Organization of African Unity was founded by the independent states of Africa. The OAU aimed to promote cooperation between African states. The 1980 Lagos Plan of Action was adopted by the organization. The plan suggested Africa should minimize their reliance upon the West by promoting intra-African trade. This began as the creation of a number of regional cooperation organizations in the different regions of Africa, such as the Southern African Development Coordination Conference. Eventually this led to the Abuja Treaty in 1991, which created the African Economic Community, an organization that promoted the development of free trade areas, customs unions, an African Central Bank, and an African common currency union.

In 2002, the OAU was succeeded by the African Union (AU), which had as one of its goals to accelerate the "economic integration of the continent".  A second goal was to "coordinate and harmonize the policies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union."

Negotiations

At the 2012 African Union summit in Addis Ababa, leaders agreed to create a new Continental Free Trade Area by 2017. At the 2015 AU summit in Johannesburg, the summit agreed to commence negotiations. This began a series of ten negotiating sessions which took place over the next three years.

The first negotiation forum was held in February 2016 and held eight meetings until the Summit in March 2018 in Kigali. From February 2017 on the technical working groups held four meetings, where technical issues were discussed and implemented in the draft. On March 8–9, 2018 the African Union Ministers of Trade approved the draft.

2018 Kigali Summit

In March 2018, at the 10th Extraordinary Session of the African Union on AfCFTA, three separate agreements were signed: the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the Kigali Declaration; and the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons. The Protocol on Free Movement of Persons seeks to establish a visa-free zone within the AfCFTA countries, and support the creation of the African Union Passport.  At the summit in Kigali on 21 March 2018, 44 countries signed the AfCFTA, 47 signed the Kigali Declaration, and 30 signed the Protocol on Free Movement of People.  While a success, there were two notable holdouts: Nigeria and South Africa, the two largest economies in Africa.

One complicating factor in the negotiations was that Africa had already been divided into eight separate free trade areas and/or customs unions, each with different regulations. These regional bodies will continue to exist; the African Continental Free Trade Agreement initially seeks to reduce trade barriers between the different pillars of the African Economic Community, and eventually use these regional organizations as building blocks for the ultimate goal of an Africa-wide customs union.

Drafting of further protocols
Negotiations continued in 2018 with Phase II, including policies of investment, competition and intellectual property rights. In January 2020, AU Assembly negotiations are envisaged to be concluded. A draft is expected for the January 2020 AU Assembly.

Institutions
The following institutions were established to facilitate the implementation of the free trade area. As a result of Phase II negotiations more committees may be established via protocols.

The AfCFTA Secretariat will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the agreement and shall be an autonomous body within the AU system. Though it will have independent legal personality, it shall work closely with the AU Commission and receive its budget from the AU. The Council of Ministers responsible for trade will decide on the location of the headquarter, structure, role and responsibilities.
The Assembly of the African Union Heads of State and Government is the highest decision-making body. It is likely to meet during the AU Summits. The Council of Ministers Responsible for Trade provides strategic trade policy oversight and ensures effective implementation and enforcement of the AfCFTA Agreement.

Several committees have been established, for trade in goods, trade in services, on rules of origin, trade remedies, non-tariff barriers, technical barriers to trade and on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Dispute resolution mechanisms nd procedures are still being negotiated, but will presumably include designation of a dispute resolution body. The Committee of Senior Trade Officials implements the Council's decisions. The Committee is responsible for the development of programs and action plans for the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement.

Implementation 

The AfCFTA is set to be implemented in phases, and some of the future phases still under negotiation. Phase I covers trade in goods and trade in services. Phase II covers intellectual property rights, investment and competition policy. Phase III covers E-Commerce.

At the 2018 Kigali summit, areas of agreement were found on trade protocols, dispute settlement procedures, customs cooperation, trade facilitation, and rules of origin. There was also agreement to reduce tariffs on 90% of all goods.  Each nation is permitted to exclude 3% of goods from this agreement. This was part of Phase I of the agreement, which covers goods and services liberalization. Some Phase I issues that remain to be negotiated include the schedule of tariff concessions and other specific commitments.

The 12th Extraordinary Session of the African Union on AfCFTA was called to launch the new agreement into its operational phase, which was hosted in Niamey on 7 July 2019. At its launch, five operational instruments that will govern the AfCFTA were activated: "the rules of origin; the online negotiating forum; the monitoring and elimination of non-tariff barriers; a digital payment system; and the African Trade Observatory."

Phase II and III negotiations are expected to be initiated by all AU member countries and held in successive rounds. In February 2020, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government decided that Phase III would begin immediately following the conclusion of Phase II negotiations, which were initially scheduled to conclude in December 2020. However, this deadline was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, and a new date (December 31, 2021) was set as the deadline for the conclusion of Phase II and III negotiations. The AfCFTA officially but largely symbolically launched on January 1, 2021.

Membership

Among the 55 AU member states, 44 signed the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (consolidated text), 47 signed the Kigali Declaration and 30 signed the Protocol on Free Movement of People at the end of the 2018 Kigali Summit.  Benin, Botswana, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, and Zambia were among the 11 countries that did not initially sign the agreement.  After the 2018 Kigali summit, more signatures were added to the AfCFTA. At the 31st African Union Summit in Nouakchott on 1 July 2018, South Africa (the second largest economy of Africa), Sierra Leone, Namibia, Lesotho and Burundi joined the agreement.  In February 2019, Guinea-Bissau, Zambia and Botswana also joined. Kenya and Ghana were the first nations to ratify the agreement, depositing their ratification on 10 May 2018. 

Of the signatories, 22 needed to deposit the instrument of ratification of the agreement for it to come into effect, and this occurred on 29 April 2019 when both Sierra Leone and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic deposited the agreement. As a result, the agreement came into force 30 days later on 30 May 2019. At this point, only Nigeria (the continent's largest economy), Eritrea and Benin had not signed. 

President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari was particularly reluctant to join the AfCFTA, fearing it would hurt Nigerian entrepreneurship and local industries, and his decision not to was praised by some local groups including the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria and the Nigeria Labour Congress. The Nigerian government intended to consult further with local businesses in order to ensure private sector buy-in to the agreement, because a key concern was whether the agreement adequately prevented anti-competitive practices such as dumping. In July 2019, just months after being re-elected to a new term, Buhari agreed to adhere the Africa free trade at the 12th extraordinary session of the assembly of the union on AfCFTA.

At the same meeting, Benin also committed to signing the agreement, leaving Eritrea as the only of the 55 African Union Member States not to sign up to the deal. Formally, Eritrea was not part of the initial agreement due to an ongoing state of war, but the 2018 peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea ended the conflict and ended the barrier to Eritrean participation in the free trade agreement.

As of May 2022, there are 54 signatories, of which 43 (80%) have deposited their instruments of ratification.   Additionally, one country (Somalia) completed its domestic ratification, but had not yet deposited their ratification with the depository by May 2020.  Eritrea is the only AU member state which had not signed the agreement by 2019.

List of signatories and parties to the agreement

Other AU member states

Eritrea has not signed due to tensions with Ethiopia, but as of 2019, following the 2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit, the AU Commissioner for Trade and Industry expected that Eritrea would eventually sign the agreement.

Human rights assessment
A July 2017 United Nations Economic Commission for Africa report argues that the CFTA may contribute to tackling poverty and inequality as its wide scope will facilitate structural changes in African economies. It is seen as a step towards meeting the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The document was targeted to ensuring human rights were considered within the negotiations.

According to Food and Agriculture Organization, recognizing the intersections of gender, agriculture, and trade, it is critical to ensure that the implementation of the AfCFTA addresses the nuanced and varied challenges that women face. It is vital that the operationalization of the AfCFTA agreement ensures that future trade policies, practices, and regulations promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls on the African continent, especially in supporting women to seize the new opportunities created ‘in agriculture’ by the AfCFTA. Implementation of the agreement that is not inclusive of women could result in a widening gender gap by negatively affecting women-led micro, small, or medium-sized enterprises and those who rely on informal trade (including cross border) for their livelihoods.
Social Call is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2003 and released on the HighNote label.

Reception

On All About Jazz, Jeff Stockton noted "Social Call is the mellow sound of the music as it used to be done. Even those who are indifferent to jazz, or even dislike jazz, can't help but enjoy this". In JazzTimes, David Franklin wrote: "Houston Person’s Social Call showcases breathy, subtone tenor. Indeed, beautiful melodies, lovingly caressed by Person’s sultry horn, constitute a generous portion of this recording. Slow tunes ... make up more than half the 11 tracks. Person treats them all with a lyrical sensitivity that allows the venerable melodies to speak for themselves". The Guardian selected it as their Jazz CD of the Week with Dave Gelly commenting "The whole thing is so agreeable that it's hard to pick bits out, but Person's firm, warm, unflappable ballad playing is a particular delight"

The Butler Madonna or Madonna and Child with Cherubim and Seraphim is a tempera on panel painting measuring 44.1 by 28.6 cm. It is attributed to Andrea Mantegna, dated to around 1460. Its poor conservation, including over-harsh restoration to Mary's face, means that some art historians cannot accept it as an autograph work and theorise that it was produced by a follower of Mantegna after an autograph original. Its provenance is unknown before 1891, when it appeared for sale at a London art dealer. It was purchased by Charles Butler, from whom it passed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1926, where it still hangs.

If it is an autograph work, it dates from after Mantegna's trip to Rome and some attribute it to the end of his Paduan period (c.1460), suggested by comparison with the Presentation at the Temple, which has similar fictive marble frame in the foreground. It belongs to a group of small-format Madonnas produced by Mantegna for private devotion - others include Madonna with Sleeping Child (Berlin), the Poldi Pezzoli Madonna and the Bergamo Madonna. The cherubim are in blue and the seraphim in red, whilst the painter has drawn on Donatello's example in showing Mary incline her face towards her son.

The Kakospictikweak River is a tributary of the North Shore of Gouin Reservoir, sinking in Quebec, Canada in the
administrative region of Mauricie of:
Nord-du-Québec: Eeyou Istchee Baie-James (municipality), townships of Pfister;
Mauricie: territory of the town of La Tuque: townships of Balete and Mathieu.

The forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second. A forest road branch serves the valley of the Kakospictikweak River and the peninsula which stretches north on . This road branch connects to route 400 which bypasses the north-eastern
part of the Gouin Reservoir; it connects the village of Parent, Quebec (via the Bazin River) and the village Wemotaci, Quebec which is located west of La Tuque. Some forest roads serve the upper part of this valley.

The surface of the Kakospictikweak River is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to
the end of March.

Geography 
The surrounding hydrographic slopes of the Kakospictikweak River are:
north side: Compton Lake, Nemegousse Lake, Cawcot River, Caopatina Lake;
east side: Dubois Lake, Normandin Lake (Normandin River), Normandin River, Buade Lake (Normandin River);
south side: Gouin reservoir;
west side: Mathieu River, Toussaint River, Baptiste Lake, Larouche Lake, De La Rencontre Creek, Pascagama River.

The Kakospictikweak River originates at the mouth of an unidentified lake (length: , altitude:) located in the township of Pfister, in Eeyou Istchee James Bay (municipality). The mouth of this head lake is located at:
 west of a mountain peak (altitude:);
 north of the mouth of the Kakospictikweak River (confluence with Omina Lake which is connecter to  Gouin Reservoir);
 north of the village center of Obedjiwan, Quebec (located on a peninsula on the north shore of Gouin Reservoir);
 northwest of the dam at the mouth of the Gouin Reservoir (confluence with the Saint-Maurice River);
 north-east of the village center of Wemotaci, Quebec;
 north-west of downtown La Tuque.

From the mouth of the head lake, the course of the Kakospictikweak River flows over  according to the following segments:

Upper course of the Kakospictikweak River (segment of)

 north-east, crossing a small unidentified lake (altitude:) on , up to its mouth;
 northeasterly, then southwesterly, skirting a mountain whose summit reaches  and crossing a full length unidentified lake (length: ; altitude:), to its mouth;
 to the South-West including crossing a full length unidentified lake (length: ; altitude:), to its mouth;
 to the southwest, to the eastern limit of Balete. Note: This limit also corresponds to the boundary between the town of La Tuque and Eeyou Istchee Baie-James (municipality);
 southwesterly in Balete Township, including crossing Wawackeciw Lake (length: ; altitude:) on , to its mouth;
 southerly passing on the east side of Baptiste Lake and crossing Piresiw Lake (length: ; altitude:), until its confluence which corresponds to the limit of the cantons of Balete and Mathieu. Note: Piresiw Lake receives the Kanimepiriskak Lake outlet on the west side;

Lower course of the Kakospictikweak River (segment of)

 southeasterly by cutting a forest road to the confluence (from the north) of the Pokotciminikew River which drains five mountain lakes upstream;
 southerly collecting the outlet of Kikikwapiskok Lake to the north shore of Kaatcipekinikatek Lake;
 southerly across Kaatcipekinikatek Lake (elevation:) along its entire length to the northern boundary of Mathieu Township. Note: this lake receives on the east side the discharge of the "Froid lake";
 southwesterly, crossing over the  Natowew Lake (length: ; altitude:) to the road bridge of route 212 in the Seskatciwan Zone;
 south forming a hook to the east, to the confluence of the Kakospictikweak River with the Gouin Reservoir.

The confluence of the Kakospictikweak River with the Gouin Reservoir is located at:
 northwest of Gouin Dam;
 north-east of the village center of Obedjiwan, Quebec;
 northwest of the village center of Wemotaci, Quebec;
 north-west of downtown La Tuque;
 northwest of the mouth of the Saint-Maurice River (confluence with the St. Lawrence River at Trois-Rivières).

The Kakospictikweak River flows into the Township of Mathieu at the bottom of a bay stretching over , e.g. the Northern part of Omina Lake on the north shore of the [[Gouin
Reservoir]]; this bay is barred on the east side by a peninsula stretching southward on  and on the west side by an advanced land to a strait separating it from a large deformed island with a length of . From the mouth of this bay, the current flows south-easterly across the Gouin
reservoir to the southeast, skirting several islands and passing through the Kikendatch Bay, up to the Gouin dam. From there, the current flows along the Saint-Maurice River to Trois-Rivières, where it flows into the St. Lawrence River.

Toponymy 
The toponym "Rivière Kakospictikweak" was formalized on September 6, 1984 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Notes and references
Caroline Quarlls (1826–1892) was the first enslaved person to travel through Wisconsin using the Underground Railroad. She reached Canada and freedom in 1842. Multiple abolitionists helped Caroline on her journey to Canada even as pursuers followed continuously. She married a freedman in Canada, becoming Caroline Quarlls Watkins.

Early life
Caroline Quarlls was born in St. Louis in 1826, enslaved by her paternal grandfather. Robert Pryor Quarlls (also Quarles), was her father and owner. Her mother had married a successful blacksmith who was born free. Quarll's mother and her sister were dead by the time she was sixteen, but Quarlls had been in contact with her stepfather who was very kind to her and talked with her about her plans to escape slavery.

A housemaid in St. Louis, Quarlls looked like her half-siblings, but was not granted the same freedom as they were. Upon her father's passing, she was acquired by her new mistress, Robert's sister and her aunt, Mrs. Charles R. Hall. Quarlls was occasionally whipped and punished. Noted as being quite intelligent, she was able to read but had never learned to write. She was brought up doing fine sewing, embroidery, and waiting upon her mistress.

Flight
When Quarlls was a teenager, her mistress became angry with her for looking at her reflection in a mirror and cut her hair off. Determined to escape such assaults, she managed to gain permission from her mistress to see a sick girl. On July 4, 1842, the 16-year-old threw a bundle of clothes out a window, retrieved them, and walked down to the ferry to begin her journey along the Underground Railroad. She had taken $100 from her former master, and purchased a ticket for a steamboat to Alton, Illinois. Of mixed race, she was able to pass as a white girl. She traveled by stagecoach through Illinois to Milwaukee. She was pursued by slave catchers for the $300 bounty placed on her. 

After staying around a week at the home of Robert Titball, a formerly enslaved barber, Titball told slavecatching-lawyers that Quarlls had been staying at her home. A Black boy who worked for him alerted Quarlls at Titball's bidding but did not take her to the place the barber suggested. Quarlls hid in a container in a boat as she was brought across the Milwaukee River by prominent attorney Asahel Finch. From Milwaukee, Quarlls was brought to Pewaukee, Wisconsin by Samuel Brown; the two traveled via an old rickety wagon. Brown transported Quarlls to the home of Lucinda and Samuel Daugherty in Lisbon, Waukesha County.  She met up with Lyman Goodnow, a conductor on the Underground Railroad.  At times she walked, and other times she hid under hay in a horse-drawn wagon. There were days of dusty trails and other times heavy rain. They traveled through stations on Wisconsin's Underground Railroad, including Prairieville (now Waukesha), Spring Prairie and Gardner's Prairie near Burlington and on to Illinois. The clerk of the steamboat that Quarlls took to Alton was liable to pay her master $800 if Quarlls was not found. Goodnow and Quarlls learned that the clerk was traveling through Illinois looking for her, too. At a schoolhouse at Beebe's Grove, Quarlls asked about the "liberty pole" near where she was standing. She learned that it was common in villages in the North as a commemoration of the birth of liberty in the United States. Quarlls asked, "How can it commemorate liberty in a country where there is no liberty; where more than one-fifth of the inhabitants are in bondage?"

They traveled through Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan, while continuing to be pursued by slave hunters and lawyers. Quarlls and Goodnow stopped at the house of Guy Beckley in Ann Arbor, the last stop before Detroit where they crossed the Detroit River for Canada. Goodnow guided her  into Canada. Abolitionists have given the two a purse of travel necessities to help the two cross the border. 
Her journey lasted five weeks throughout multiple states into Canada.

Life in Canada
After arriving in Canada, Caroline attended school during her first year in Canada. After three years, she married an older widower, Allen Watkins, himself a freed slave. From Virginia and Kentucky, he had children with his first wife. He was a cook and Quarlls and her husband made a good living for their family through hard work. She had learned that she had been left property, which she would have received if she had remained in St. Louis until she became of age. The Watkins raised three boys and three girls, who all had good educations.

She corresponded with Goodnow, stating,

Caroline Quarlls Watkins died in Sandwich in March 1888 or 1892.

Berry graduated from New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico in 1956. In 1960, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where in 1958 he won the Academy of American Poets Prize. He went on to earn his Juris Doctor degree from Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois in 1965 and was admitted to the Nebraska State Bar in 1965. Berry graduated from the Infantry Officer School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School in Charlottesville, Virginia.

As a Captain in Vietnam, Berry was awarded the Bronze Star and the Vietnamese Medal of Honor First Class (Gold). He served as defense counsel with the 1st Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, the 199th Light Infantry Brigade, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 101st Airborne, the 82nd Airborne, and the 5th Special Forces on a temporary basis.

Berry is recognized in the New Mexico Military Institute Hall of Fame. He is also the recipient of the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry (with Palm) and the recipient for the FBI Award for Service in the Public Interest.

Green Beret Affair and Those Gallant Men: On Trial in Vietnam 

In Vietnam from 1968 to 1969, Berry was the chief defense counsel for the largest general court martial jurisdiction in Vietnam, II Field Force Vietnam, numbering more than 80,000 soldiers. His work on the defense counsel includes the "Green Beret Affair", where in 1969 members of the Green Berets were charged with the murder of a double agent.

Berry wrote on his first-hand experiences as a lawyer fighting in a combat zone in Those Gallant Men: On Trial in Vietnam, published May 1, 1984. The book examines the charges filed against the Green Berets and maneuvers through the legal proceedings of the trial, offering an insider's view through stories and explanations of the dynamics and strategy of litigation between the CIA, the US Army, and the Green Berets during the Vietnam War.  His work in the field was also featured in the book Judge Advocates in Combat: Army Lawyers in Military Operations from Vietnam to Haiti by Fred Borch.

Law career 
Following his military service, Berry was briefly associated with Henry B. Rothblatt Offices in New York from 1970 through 1971. There, he tried a number of high-profile cases before returning to Lincoln, Nebraska to continue regional practice primarily in the areas of criminal defense, drug crimes, driving while intoxicated, white collar crime, state and federal felony practice, veterans appeals and murder.

In 2000, Berry's son, John Berry Jr., left the army for law school and join Berry Law Firm. His son Rory Berry also works at the law firm.

In 1986, Berry was the Civilian Defense Counsel for one of the biggest drug busts in Japanese history.

Berry has appeared in court in 24 states and two foreign countries.

Berry Law Firm is listed in the Martindale-Hubbell Bar Register of Preeminent Attorneys.

In 2014, Berry co-authored the book The Twelfth Victim: The Innocence of Caril Fugate in the Starkweather Murder Rampage with Ohio lawyer Linda Battisti on Caril Ann Fugate, the teen girlfriend who accompanied spree killer Charles Starkweather during the murders of 1958. The book was recommended by Steven Drizin, attorney for Brendan Dassey, whose case gained international attention due to the Netflix series Making a Murderer, which exposed the prosecution's coercion of Dassey resulting in a false confession.

Berry is a member of the Melvin Belli Society, and a fellow on the American Board of Criminal Defense Lawyers  and of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

Personal life 
While practicing law, Berry hosted The John Stevens Berry Show for more than a decade, first airing on KLIN and later on KZUM. The last day of the show, August 1, 1997, was declared John Stevens Berry Day by the former governor of Nebraska, Ben Nelson.

A data protection officer (DPO) ensures, in an independent manner, that an organization applies the laws protecting individuals' personal data. The designation, position and tasks of a DPO within an organization are described in Articles 37, 38 and 39 of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Many other countries require the appointment of a DPO, and it is becoming more prevalent in privacy legislation.  

According to the GDPR, the DPO shall directly report to the highest management level. This doesn't mean the DPO has to be directly managed at this level but they must have direct access to give advice to senior managers who are making decisions about personal data processing.

The core responsibilities of the DPO include ensuring his/her organization is aware of, and trained on, all relevant GDPR obligations. Common tasks of a DPO include ensuring proper processes are in place for subject access requests, data mapping, privacy impact assessments, as well as raising data privacy awareness with employees. Additionally, they must conduct audits to ensure compliance, address potential issues proactively, and act as a liaison between his/her organization and the public regarding all data privacy matters.

In Germany, a 2001 law established a requirement for a DPO in certain organizations and included various protections around the scope and tenure for the role, including protections against dismissal for bringing problems to the attention of management. Many of these concepts were incorporated into the drafting of Article 38 of the GDPR and have continued to be incorporated in other privacy standards.

The Otú Norte or Otú-Pericos Fault is an inactive sinistral oblique strike-slip fault in the department of Antioquia in northern Colombia. The fault has a total length of  and runs along an average north-northwest to south-southeast strike of 346.4 ± 8, cross-cutting the northern part of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. Together with the parallel Bagre Norte Fault the fault separates the Central Ranges from its northeasternmost continuation, the Serranía de San Lucas.

Etymology 
The fault was by Feininger et al. in 1972 named after Otú Airport in vereda Otú in Remedios, Antioquia.

Description 
The Otú Norte Fault crosses the northern part of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The fault strikes north-northwest to south-southeast and appears to branch off the Palestina Fault. The Otú Fault extends in a northwest direction to near Nechí, where it is covered by young Quaternary deposits. The sinistral oblique reverse fault separates blocks of totally dissimilar geology and lithology; the metamorphic Precambrian San Lucas Complex and Jurassic igneous rocks (diorites) of the Segovia Batholith on the east are juxtaposed against the Cretaceous Santa Isabel Stock and Paleozoic quartz-feldspar gneisses and quartzitic arc rocks of the Cajamarca Complex on the west. Just west of Remedios, the fault forms the contact between the Cretaceous Antioquia and Jurassic Segovia Batholiths. The northern end apparently splays into several faults that cross the Nechí River.

Activity 
A rate of less than  per year is estimated for the fault, considered inactive. Displaced Quaternary terraces as high as  are reported and the fault offsets the Tertiary erosion surface of the Central Ranges. A total displacement of the fault has been estimated at .

Economic importance 

The fault separates two major gold mining areas in Antioquia; the Segovia-Remedios mining district and La Ye mine in the east, and the placer deposits of Gramalote and Cisneros in the west. North of Zaragoza, the fault underlies the El Limón mine. Antioquia produces 50% of all gold in Colombia.

The ductile zone of the fault produced mylonites in mainly the amphibolite facies of the Segovia Batholith. This ductile behavior was later overprinted by fragile tectonics, leaving cataclasis and fault breccias in the fault zone as well as striations in the quartz of the batholith. These deformations are interpreted as second grade Riedel shears.
Aspergillus duricaulis is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It is from the Fumigati section. The species was first described in 1965. It has been reported to produce pseurotin A, fumagillin, asperpentyn, duricaulic acid, asperdurin, phthalides, chromanols, cyclopaldic acid, and 3-O-methylcyclopolic acid.

Growth and morphology

A. duricaulis has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid® (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below.

The 2018–19 South West Peninsula League season was the twelfth in the history of the South West Peninsula League, a football competition in England, that feeds the Premier Division of the Western Football League. The league had been formed in 2007 from the merger of the Devon County League and the South Western League, and is restricted to clubs based in Cornwall and Devon. The Premier Division of the South West Peninsula League is on the same level of the National League System as the Western League Division One (Step 6).

The constitution was announced on 25 May 2018. At the end of this season, significant restructuring of the league was to take place. With this in mind, it was decided not to transfer clubs between Division One East and Division One West just for one season, solely in order to balance the numbers in each division for this season.

For 2019–20, the league will consist of two Step 6 divisions of twenty clubs each. These two divisions will be made up of the 2018–19 Step 6 (Premier Division) clubs, plus others promoted from Step 7 and below. There will be two new Step 7 leagues below the South West Peninsula League in 2019–20, the Devon League and the St Piran League.

Premier Division

The Premier Division featured 20 teams, the same as the previous season, after Plymouth Parkway were promoted to the Western League Premier Division, and Stoke Gabriel were demoted to Division One East. 

Two new clubs joined the league:
Elburton Villa, promoted from Division One West.
Millbrook, promoted from Division One West.
Reserve sides are not eligible for promotion to Step 5.

Witheridge withdrew from the league on 7 August, before any matches had been played. They joined the Devon League at the start of the 2019–20 season.

At the end of the season, any clubs not promoted to Step 5 or taking voluntary relegation to Step 7 were placed in one of the two Step 6 divisions for 2019–20, except Plymouth Argyle Reserves, who did not apply to stay at Step 6. A Plymouth Argyle Development side joined the Devon League at the start of the 2019–20 season.

League table

Division One East
Division One East featured 19 clubs, increased from 18 the previous season, after Totnes & Dartington and Galmpton & Roselands resigned from the league, and three new clubs joined:

Elmore, promoted from the Devon and Exeter League.
Stoke Gabriel, demoted from the Premier Division due to ground grading failure.
Waldon Athletic, promoted from the South Devon League.

All clubs applied for promotion to Step 6 next season except: Alphington, Budleigh Salterton, Liverton United, St Martins, Teignmouth, University of Exeter and Waldon Athletic. The remainder were promoted to Step 6.

Torridgeside must secure full planning for ground grading G by 31 March 2020, or face demotion at the end of 2019–20.

Brixham, Honiton, Stoke Gabriel and Torridgeside must install floodlights by 31 March 2021, or face demotion at the end of 2020–21.

League table

Division One West
Division One West featured 15 clubs, reduced from 18 the previous season, after Millbrook and Elburton Villa were promoted to the Premier Division, Illogan RBL were relegated, and Penryn Athletic left the league. One new club joined:

Bere Alston United, promoted from the East Cornwall League.

All clubs applied for promotion to Step 6 next season except: Bere Alston United, Bude Town, Ludgvan and Plymstock United. The remainder were promoted to Step 6.

Dobwalls, Mousehole, St Dennis and Wendron United must install floodlights by 31 March 2021, or face demotion at the end of 2020–21.

Avian foraging refers to the range of activities and behaviours exhibited by birds in their quest for food. In addition to their unique body adaptations, birds have a range of described behaviours that differ from the foraging behaviours of other animal groups. According to the foraging habitat, birds may be grouped into foraging guilds. Foraging includes a range of activities, starting with the search for food, making use of sensory abilities, and which may involve one or more birds either of a single or even of multiple species. This is followed by locomotion and movements to obtain or capture the food, followed by the processing or handling of the foods prior to ingestion. Like all organisms foraging entails balancing the energy spent (in search, locomotion, avoiding predators, handling food) and energy gained. The high metabolic rate of birds, among the highest in the homoeotherm groups, constrains them to ensure a net positive gain in energy and have led evolutionary ethologists to develop the idea of optimal foraging.

Energetics 

Foraging involves expending energy and seeking food can be both time and energy consuming. Birds make use of a variety of approaches to improve the efficiency of their foraging. These include foraging in flocks which provides many eyes to seek patches rich in food while also reducing the risk of predation by increasing the efficiency of detecting predators, increasing time spent on handling food, and by reducing individual risk. It has been suggested that individuals may exchange information for instance at communal roosts.

Foraging guilds 
Assemblages of bird species that share common habitats or substrate from which food is gathered, and to some extent foraging technique are conceptual grouped within in foraging or trophic guilds. Various attempts have been made to classify foraging guilds for ecological studies and universal and undisputed classifications do not exist. It must also be noted that species may belong to multiple foraging guilds depending on situation (for example, while breeding, in migration, or in disturbed habitats). Specific classifications are used in ecological and behavioural studies. The classifications are often made according to multiple hierarchical criteria and a full classification may include multiple terms. To take an example a bird may be described as  "nocturnal gleaning insectivore" with parts of the classification dealing with the time of day, the diet and the technique used to obtain food.

Guild classification on food type based mainly on terms used by North American ornithologists includes:

 Carnivore - (feeding on) vertebrates
 Crustaceovore- crustacea
Insectivore - insects
Molluscivore - molluscs
Piscivore - fish
 Vermivore - various elongated invertebrates especially annelids
 Sanguinivore - blood feeding (e.g. oxpeckers, vampire ground finch)
 Frugivore - fruits
 Granivore - seeds
 Nectarivore - nectar (e.g. sunbirds, hummingbirds)
 Herbivore - plants (vegetative parts)
 Omnivore - a variety of foods

Guild classification based on habitat or substrate from which food is gathered (from generic to specific) includes:

 aerial
 subcanopy
 ground
 meadow
 arboreal
 bark
 floral 
 upper canopy
 lower canopy
 undergrowth
 foliage
 water
 coastal
 coastal beach
 coast bottom
 coastal rock
 coastal water surface
 freshwater
 freshwater marshes
 freshwater bottom
 freshwater shoreline
 freshwater surface
 mud
 pelagic
 pelagic surface
 riparian 
 bottom
 shoreline

Guild classifications based on foraging technique include the following. These may also involve other associated behaviours.

 Ambushing / stalking - waiting for prey to come within reach, may involve slow walking
 Baiting is a technique known in about 12 species of herons. Here the herons drop feathers or small objects on the water surface to attract fishes to investigate the disturbance and come within striking range of the bird. Burrowing owls use dung to attract beetles.
Foot stirring movements are used by egrets as part of their strategy to disturb prey into range. A variation is foot raking, where the submerged sediment is disturbed by a slow and deliberate backward dragging of one of the feet.
 Chasing - pursuing prey on the ground
Leaping - making use of jumps that are powered by the legs
Dabbling  - in aquatic birds, involves dipping the head or neck (ie not just the bill) under water
 Plunging - diving from air into water to capture prey with bill or into open mouth
 Foot plunging - involves plunging from the air to the water or ground surface to seize prey using the feet
 Diving - in aquatic birds, involves the whole body being submerged
 Excavating - in arboreal birds, searching in wood or bark by drilling a hole
 Hammering - delivering a series of pecks without pause (used by woodpeckers)
 Scaling - feeding under bark by removing or prying bark
Remsen and Scott (1990) more specifically defined terms like chisel and flake
 Scratching - to remove a layer of substrate using the feet
 Piracy or Kleptoparasitism - used by some birds to make others disgorge their prey. This is seen in many species of bird including raptors, skuas and a few others and notably absent among seed-eating birds. It is found mainly when hosts are found in numbers and when the food item is large and visible.
Gleaning - picking specific items from the surface of the substrate
 Hover-gleaning - picking specific items while flying
 Grazing - feeding on grasses, sedges, or their seeds in fields or meadows
 Probing - inserting bill into substrate and using touch or taste to detect prey
 Mantling - spreading wings and body around prey to protect from piracy, especially seen in birds of prey.
Tool using is seen in some birds. New Caledonian and Hawaiian crows fashion tools to obtain food while woodpecker finches are known to use cactus spines to extract prey out of holes in wood that are too narrow for their beaks to be inserted in.
Gaping - inserting bill into substrate and then opening apart the bill to pry
 Grubbing - digging up soil for roots and tubers
 Skimming - flying low over water to pick food items using beak
 Scavenging - feeding on refuse or carrion
Hawking, fly-catching, or aerial sallying refers to obtaining aerial food, typically flying insects. The birds typically stay on the wing while handling and ingesting the prey. The more specific term flycatching is used to describe birds that fly out of a perch to capture and insect to return with the prey to a perch before handling the prey.
Flush-and-pursue - here the prey is first put into flight before pursuit
Screening - flying with open bills to capture aerial prey 
Straining - strain food from water or mud using special structures in the bill
Foraging - a more general term for picking food from a substrate

Other miscellaneous foraging behaviours include:Foot trembling movements may be used by waders such as plovers and lapwings. They are used mainly on wet soil or while wading in shallow water. Some waders move around rapidly in circles, these include the phalaropes, best known for their pirouetting movements, often in deeper water that reaches until their body. Among the first to document the behaviour was the German ornithologist Oskar Heinroth who described it in 1915.
Foot paddling is a foraging behaviour unique to gulls (subfamily Larinae of the family Laridae). The behaviour is exhibited while perched in shallow water, and sometimes on dry land, over short grass or bare soil. The gulls rapidly move their feet up and down while staying at a spot and it is thought that this flushes subterranean prey that they then detect and feed on although there is no definite evidence. Other terms describing the term have included paddling, puddling, pumping, stamping, thumping, tramping, trampling, treading and trembling. The behaviour is found in young gulls and is considered to be innate and does not require learning. The behaviour has been compared by lay observers to rapid dancing moves.

Claire Madden (14 October 1905 – 15 October 1998) was an Irish librarian, feminist and political activist.

Early life
Claire Madden was born Kathleen May Delacheroise Madden at Boley House, Coolattin, County Wicklow on 14 October 1905. She was the eldest daughter and second child of teachers Thomas and May Madden (née Glynn). She had an older brother, Tom, and younger sister, Mabel Anne Constance. This was her father's second marriage, and Madden had 7 older half siblings who appear to have cut off contact with their father. She was raised Protestant, but converted to Catholicism later in life, along with her interest in the Irish language and studying Irish history. The family lived in Galway, before moving to Stockport, Cheshire, where her parents ran a small private school. Madden and her two siblings were educated by their parents, with emphasis on the classics and music.

Career
Madden worked for a number of years in a public library as a librarian in Stockport. She moved to London with her mother and sister, working at the London Library Service at Willesden going on to become a branch manager. She excelled in her profession, going on to become a fellow of the Royal College of Librarians. She was a scholar and book collector, with her own library holding a large amount of material relating to classical, Irish and literary subjects.

She was an Irish nationalist, and a sympathiser with Sinn Féin from the 1920s. She became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in the 1930s, as well as a number of feminist organisations. She followed the Six Point Group's principles from the 1930s. Madden became pregnant in 1938, and travelled to Dublin to stay with a friend until the birth of her daughter Etain on 8 January 1939. From the 1940s Madden became more involved with the CPGB and became the secretary of the Six Point Group.

Madden resigned from the library service when a less qualified man was promoted ahead of her. She took up the role of librarian at the Daily Worker, a position she held until the 1960s. Continuing her work with the Six Point Group, she oversaw a number of publications, statements and letters to the press. Towards the end of the 1940s, Madden became interested in the "coupled vote", an idea promoted by George Bernard Shaw. Such a vote involved couples of candidates of a man and a woman, rather than individuals, resulting in gender equality in parliament. Madden exchanged letters with Shaw on the topic, and he encouraged her to publish a pamphlet on the subject. The pamphlet, published by the Six Point Group, is quoted at length in Dora Russell's autobiography, and in a preface to one of Shaw's plays.

Madden led a number of CPGB delegations to Russia in the 1950s and 1960s. She visited and travelled around Ireland extensively, going on to buy a cottage in Galway city. She became an active member of the Connolly Association, supported C. Desmond Greaves, and was a member of Sinn Féin. She vote articles for An Phoblacht, particularly on the topic of Irish unity, as well on feminist critique of Irish issues, and studies of the status of women in ancient Irish history. Informed by this study, she followed the Irish tradition of women not taking their husband's surname after marriage.

Later life
Madden lived at 75 Bedford Road, East Finchley until her death on 15 October 1998. The Women's Library, London, holds Madden's correspondence along with the records of the Six Point Group. Madden outlived her daughter, and donated her collection of prints to what would become the Irish Museum of Modern Art in 1989.
The Bustill family is a prominent American family of largely African, European and Lenape Native American descent. The family has included artists, educators, journalists and activists, both against slavery and against Jim Crow.

History
Born in Burlington, New Jersey on February 2, 1732, Cyrus Bustill was a son of the Quaker lawyer Samuel Bustill and Parthenia, a woman of African descent who was held in bondage by him. When Samuel Bustill died in 1742, his legal widow, Grace Bustill, subsequently arranged for the sale of Cyrus Bustill to fellow Quaker Thomas Prior (or "Pryor") with the understanding that Prior would allow Cyrus to train and earn enough money as an apprentice baker in order to purchase his freedom.

Cyrus would go on to either purchase his freedom or receive manumission at an indeterminate date, then become a businessman and landowner in his own right thereafter. At the time of his death in 1806, he was a leading member of the African-American upper class of Philadelphia.

Cyrus and his wife, the mixed race Elizabeth Morey (1746-1827, of Native American and European descent), had eight children. One of them was the abolitionist and feminist advocate Grace Douglass.

Other notable descendants of Cyrus and Elizabeth Morey Bustill include the performer and activist Paul Robeson, the artist David Bustill Bowser, the educator, abolitionist and writer Sarah Mapps Douglass, the journalist and activist Gertrude Bustill Mossell, and the artist and activist Robert Douglass Jr.

Woldemar Anatol Weyl (1901 – July 30, 1975) was a German-born scientist.

Weyl taught at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute between 1932 and 1936, when he began traveling to the United States as a visiting professor at Pennsylvania State University. Due to the increasing influence of the Nazi Party, Weyl choose not to return to Germany and was offered full tenure at PSU in 1938. In 1960, Weyl and mathematician Haskell Curry were appointed to the first two Evan Pugh Professorships at Penn State. Weyl died in State College, Pennsylvania on July 30, 1975, aged 74.
"Johnny Cash" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Lenny Kravitz from his 11th studio album Raise Vibration. It was released as the album's fourth single on . The music video for the song was directed by Mathieu Bitton.

Background
Kravitz wrote the song as a tribute to Cash as the latter helped him pass through one of the darkest moments of his life. Johnny Cash and his wife, June, were the first persons whom Kravitz saw after learning that his mother, actress Roxie Roker, had died from breast cancer in 1995. In that time, Kravitz lived in Los Angeles at producer Rick Rubin's house. Cash and Carter were there as well. In an interview with the BBC, Kravitz said, “I was a bit fazed and out of it and the two of them just came up to me and surrounded me and held me … We weren’t lifelong friends. I didn’t know them that long. We were flatmates,” says Kravitz. "They decided at that moment [to] treat me like they would treat someone in their family. It was a beautiful moment of humanity and love."

Reception
Mark Savage of BBC called the song "the sumptuous, slide guitar-assisted ballad hides a deeply personal story of grief and compassion." Joseph Hudak of Rolling Stone said, "In the slow-burning "Johnny Cash," Kravitz channels the memory, using it as a modern-day plea for compassion, while a flange guitar effect swirls around him." Madison Desler of Paste wrote, "“Johnny Cash” flips back and forth in the same song—the crazy funky, Parliament-style intro disappointingly dissolving into a lackluster ballad that definitely doesn’t need to be six minutes long."
Oahe Downstream Recreation Area is a state recreation area in Stanley County, South Dakota in the United States. The recreation area is named for being immediately downstream of the Oahe Dam and Lake Oahe, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam and reservoir. The recreation area is located along the Missouri River and is popular for camping, fishing and other water-based recreation. The area is located about 7 miles upstream of Pierre - the state capitol. The recreation area was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers following construction of Oahe Dam, and legislation passed by Congress transferred ownership of the recreation area to the State of South Dakota in 2002.
Efferia albibarbis is a species of robber flies in the family Asilidae.
Borrie Church is a medieval church in the province of Scania, Sweden. It is one of the smallest Romanesque churches in the province. It belongs to the Diocese of Lund.

History and architecture
Borrie Church is one of the smallest Romanesque churches in Scania. It was built as a church belonging to the farmstead of a local lord during the first half of the 12th century. It retains much of its original details, such as the northern and southern portals and the architectural element connecting the nave with the choir in the form of a triumphal arch. It contains Romanesque sculptures. In general, the architecture displays influences from Anglo-Saxon architecture; one source mentions St Bene't's Church in Cambridge as a direct influence.

The original church has been altered little in the course of history. A western tower was built during the 13th century but probably collapsed already during the late Middle Ages. A church porch was built in front of the southern portal during the 15th century, but removed in 1874. In 1874 the apse and the westerns' gable of the church were also destroyed, after which the church was abandoned. It was restored in 1928-29, and the apse and gable rebuilt. In 1978, the church was depicted on the association Skåneland's flag Christmas stamps.

The 2019 Belgian Super Cup was a football match that took place on 20 July 2019 between Genk, the winners of the 2018–19 Belgian First Division A, and Mechelen, the winners of the 2018–19 Belgian Cup. In its eighth appearance, Genk won its second Belgian Super Cup after already winning the 2011 edition, by a convincing 3–0 margin. Defender Sébastien Dewaest was twice able to score from a set piece delivery, with Dante Vanzeir scoring the final goal in the closing minutes. Mechelen could have become only the ninth different club to win the Belgian Super Cup, but failed to win again after an earlier loss in the 1987 Belgian Super Cup. With the victory of Genk, the Belgian Super Cup was won for the 15th consecutive year by the league winners, as the 2004 Belgian Super Cup still marked the last year the cup winners overcame the league winners, when Club Brugge beat Anderlecht.

Kitaev's House is a building of the historical significance in Pushkin, Saint Petersburg. It was built in 1827, and has since been registered as a cultural heritage object. The building is located on 2/19 Pushkinskaya Street.

History 
The house was built in 1827 by the architect VM Gornostaev for the court footman Yakov Kitaev, the valet of Nicholas I. Kitaev died in 1831, and the house passed to his widow Anna Kitaeva. In the same year, Alexander Pushkin and his wife spent the summer and autumn in the house. Pushkin at this time worked on The Tale of Tsar Saltan graduated from the novel Eugene Onegin, began to write the novel Roslavlev, and also prepared The Story of Belkin for publication.

Among the other owners of the house are: Vera Pryanishnikova, the wife of the real secret counselor (1857), Fedor Ivanovich Pryanishnikov (1866), daughter of the merchant Olga Skryabin (1870). In 1877, the wife of the state councilor Olga Vladimirovna Ivanova bought it from the latter, which she owned until the October Revolution. At her house was rebuilt: the portico on the corner of the house was turned into a glazed gallery, the house was expanded along the facade into two windows on both sides. In 1910, a memorial plaque was placed on the house in memory of Pushkin's residence. Since 1917, the house has housed a holiday home for sisters of mercy, and since 1920, the acclimatization station of the Supreme Council of National Economy was located. Since 1931, the house has been inhabited. In the Great Patriotic War, he was seriously damaged but rebuilt. Since 1958, the house opened a museum "Dacha AS Pushkin", and in 1976, the house was completely transferred to the museum

Architecture 
The house is wooden, with a rounded mezzanine at the corner. Before the restructuring, the corner formed a curved portico, otherwise the balcony of the mezzanine was decorated. During the restoration for the museum, the living room, the dining room and the pantry were restored according to the historical design and memoirs of contemporaries. Later, the boudoir and the bedroom were also restored. The rooms are furnished with furniture of Pushkin's time.
The 2019 Hawthorn Football Club season was the club's 95th season in the Australian Football League and 118th overall, the 20th season playing home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the 19th season playing home games at the University of Tasmania Stadium, the 15th season under head coach Alastair Clarkson, and the 1st season with Ben Stratton as club captain. A 19-point loss to Sydney in round 14 meant that Hawthorn could not match their 15–7 record from 2018. A 70-point win over Gold Coast meant that for a tenth-consecutive season Hawthorn won at least 10 games. Hawthorn finished the season in ninth-place with a 11–11 record, thus missing the finals for the second time in the last three seasons.

Simon Janssen (born 25 September 2000) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Eerste Divisie club VVV-Venlo.

Career
Janssen progressed through the VVV-Venlo youth academy after arriving there from the SV Blerick in 2010. He made his professional debut for the club on his 18th birthday on 25 September 2018 in a 3–0 away win in the KNVB Cup over Westlandia, replacing Tino-Sven Sušić in the 73rd minute. He made his Eredivisie debut three months later in a 4–1 loss to Feyenoord on 6 December 2018, coming off the bench for Evert Linthorst.

On 18 April 2019, Janssen signed a two-year contract with VVV, with an option for an additional year. Three months later he received the , the yearly award for VVV's best academy player.

VVV exercised the option in Janssen's contract in March 2021, keeping him in Venlo until 2022. On 7 December 2021, he signed a two-year contract extension until 2024, with a unilateral option to extend for a further year. At that point Janssen, originally a midfielder, was converted to play left-back by head coach Jos Luhukay.

Career statistics
Asín tibuok is a rare Filipino artisanal sea salt from the Boholano people made from filtering seawater through ashes. A variant of the salt is also known as túltul  or dúkdok among the Ilonggo people. It is made similarly to asín tibuok but is boiled with gatâ (coconut milk).

Both of them are part of the unique traditional methods of producing sea salt for culinary use among the Visayan people of the central Philippine islands. They differ in taste from salt obtained through traditional drying beds or modern methods. Asín tibuok has a sharp taste with smoky and fruity undertones, while túltul has an innate savory flavor. They are characteristically finely textured with small granules. They are consumed by grating a light dusting over food.

The tradition of making asín tibuok and túltul is nearly extinct due to the difficulty and length of time it takes to manufacture them, the passing of the salt iodization (ASIN) law in 1995, as well as competition with modern imported salts. They are only barely preserved in Bohol, Capiz, and Guimaras. Asín tibuok is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food organization.

Names
Asín tibuok literally means "unbroken salt" or "whole salt" in the Cebuano language of the Boholano people. It is the name of the salt in the island of Bohol.

Similar salt-making traditions also exist in Guimaras island and the neighboring province of Capiz in Panay Island. In Guimaras, it is known as túltul or tul-tul, meaning "lump"; while in Capiz, it is known as dúkdok, meaning "pounded" or "pulverized". Both names are in the Hiligaynon language of the Ilonggo people.

Production
The method of production varies slightly between the Boholano asín tibuok and the Ilonggo túltul or dúkdok. Both methods can only be done for six months of the year, from December to May, due to the fluctuations in seawater salinity during the rainy seasons.

Bohol
Boholano asín tibuok is made by soaking coconut husks for several months in special pits continually filled with seawater during the tides. They are then cut into small pieces and dried for a few days. They are burned in a pile until reduced completely to ash. This takes about a week.  The ash (called gasang) are gathered into a funnel-shaped bamboo filtering device. Seawater is poured into the ash, allowing the water to leach out the salt from the ashes. The brine (known as tasik) is collected into a hollowed out coconut trunk beneath the funnels.

The tasik is poured into special clay pots and hung in walls in a special furnace. These are boiled for a few hours in the furnace, continually replenishing the pots with more tasik once some evaporate. Eventually, the pots will crack, revealing the solidified mass of salt. The salt mass will be initially very hot, and it usually takes a few hours before it is cool enough to be handled. They are sold along with the broken domed pots which has given them the nickname "the dinosaur egg" in international markets due to their appearance.

Guimaras and Capiz
Ilonggo túltul, duldul, or dúkdok is made by gathering driftwood (or) and other washed-up plant matter (twigs, reeds, coconut husks, bamboo stems, etc.) from the beach. These are burned completely into ash for about a week. The ash is then gathered into cylindrical woven bamboo containers known as kaing. The kaing are placed on bamboo platforms and a container is placed underneath. Seawater is poured through the ash and caught on these containers. The brine is then strained and transferred into other containers where it is mixed with gatâ (coconut milk). These are poured into molds (hurnohan) and boiled over an outdoor stove (kalan). More of the liquid is continually poured into the molds as they evaporate until nothing but a solid mass of salt remains. These brick-like lumps (known as bareta) are then packaged and sold.

Culinary uses
Asín tibuok and túltul are usually consumed by grating a light dusting of them over food. They were traditionally dusted over plain hot rice with a few drops of oil and eaten as is. They are also used to season sinangag (traditional fried rice). Chunks can also be broken off and dipped into stews and dishes or ground and used like regular table salt.

Conservation
Salt-makers (asinderos) were once important professions in Philippine society, but the craft is nearly extinct in modern times. Part of this is due to the time-consuming traditional methods of producing salt and the hard work that go with it. Artisanal salt-makers can not compete with the cheap imported salt prevalent today in the Philippines. The passage of Republic Act No. 8172, the Act for Salt Iodization Nationwide (ASIN), in 1995 also placed further stress on local salt-makers, forcing many to give up the industry altogether.

Both asín tibuok and túltul are only made by a few families today. They are commonly sold for the tourist trade for their novelty as well as to gourmet restaurants that feature Filipino cuisine. Due to their rarity, they are considerably more expensive than regular salt. The demand is usually high for asín tibuok and túltul, but the supply can not keep up.

Asín tibuok is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food movement.

Liberec railway station is a railway station in the city of Liberec, the capital of the Liberec Region, Czech Republic.

History and description 

The railway station was built in 1859 as a part of connection between Liberec and Pardubice to the south, and Zittau to the north. The project was realised by Společnost Pardubicko-liberecké dráhy (Pardubice-Liberec Railway Company). In 1900 the station area had to be improved because of a new line to Česká Lípa. A second large reconstruction was completed in 2009–11.

All five platforms are equipped with elevators and audiovisual information systems. Daily express trains link Liberec with Děčín, Ústí nad Labem, Hradec Králové and Pardubice, but there is no direct connection to Prague. The private company Die Länderbahn run services branded Trilex which connect Liberec with Zittau and Dresden.

Other frequented stations in the city are Liberec-Horní Růžodol on line 086 and Liberec-Rochlice on line 036.

Services
The station is served by two express routes operated by Czech Railways.

Vladivostok railway station is a railway station in Vladivostok, Russia. It is the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Also, Aeroexpress (Express Primorya) from this station to Vladivostok International Airport (Knevichi Railway Station) are operated.

History
The author of the project, architect P.E. Bazilevsky, took part in laying the station building, laying the first stone of the structure on May 19 (31), 1891 in the presence of Tsarevich Nikolai Aleksandrovich, the future emperor Nicholas II. On November 2, 1893, a solemn consecration of the station took place, and a rail link along the route Vladivostok - Ussuriysk was opened.

Initially, it was a stone building with an iron roof, in the middle of the one-story, on the edges - a two-story. The floors in the building were covered with clay Japanese plates - they are well preserved to this day. In 1910–1912, in connection with the construction of Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station, the station in Vladivostok was designed and expanded by the civil engineering engineer V. A. Planson in the image and similarity of Yaroslavsky, creating architecturally finished stations at both ends of the Trans-Siberian railway. The original building became one of the parts of the railway station. On the western facade was the mosaic coat of arms of the Primorskaya Oblast, and on the east - the coat of arms of Moscow.
Since 1924, the appearance of the building began to change gradually: a two-headed eagle was shot, mosaic panels with coats of arms disappeared under a layer of plaster, and relief images of glazed ceramics on Russian folklore and fairy tales. The color of the facade has changed from yellow to green. In 1936, the interiors of the station were painted by the artist G. Grigorovich, and twenty years later V. Gerasimenko painted the ticket hall, creating a panel “Our Great Motherland” there.
In the seventies and eighties of the twentieth century, the outer walls were painted green. The restoration of the building, carried out between 1994 and 1996 by the Russian-Italian company Tegola Canadese, brought the building closer to its pre-revolutionary appearance.

Aviary Takes is the fifth studio album by Australian musician Dan Sultan, released on 15 March 2019. The album sees Sultan recording acoustic and piano versions of his most celebrated tracks from his four studio albums to date, as well as three cover-versions.

Sultan said "Aviary Takes has been a very rewarding and fulfilling experience. I've been able to go over songs from my past catalogue and also record a few tunes from some of my favourite artists. It's very stripped back and it's the first time I've worked with the great and very talented Matt Redlich who produced the sessions."

The album promoted the album with a tour commencing in Hepburn Springs on 23 February and concluding in Port Macquarie on 11 May 2019. Upon announcement of the tour, Sultan said "I'm really looking forward to hitting the regional road with The Aviary Takes tour."

In July 2019, Aviary Takes was nominated for Album of the Year at the National Indigenous Music Awards.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2019, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Blues and Roots Album.

Reception

   
Josh Leeson from The Herald said "Mostly Aviary Takes is a re-interpretation of Sultan's extensive catalogue. Some tracks like 'Old Fitzroy' experience minor changes, while others like 'Kingdom' breathe with new vitality by being stripped bare. This is the reset Sultan needed."

The Pearson Electra is an American trailerable sailboat that was designed by Carl Alberg as a Midget Ocean Racing Club (MORC) racer and first built in 1960.

The Electra design was developed into the Pearson Ensign in 1962, primarily by enlarging the cockpit and shrinking the cabin. The two boats share the same hull design.

Production
The Electra was the second design built by Pearson Yachts. A total of 350 examples were completed before production ended.

Design
The Electra is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a raised reverse transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel. It displaces  and carries  of ballast.

The design has a draft of  with the standard long keel and is normally fitted with a small  outboard motor for docking and maneuvering.

The design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double "V"-berth in the bow cabin and two straight settee berths in the main cabin. The head is located in the bow cabin under the "V"-berth. Cabin headroom is .

The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 264 and a hull speed of .

Operational history
The boat is supported by an active class club, the Pearson Yachts Portal.

In a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, "this early fiberglass Alberg design was introduced the year after the ground-breaking 29-foot Pearson Triton hit the ways in 1959, and was one of the very first small fiberglass cruising sailboats. In those days the marketers weren't always sure what the market would bear, so the Electra at first was sold as a basic two-berth overnighter, with extra cost options that would make her a full-fledged cruiser (forward berths, galley, icebox, toilet, etc.). The Pearson Ensign 22, a weekend version using the same hull but featuring a larger cockpit and smaller cabin, followed in 1962, and turned out to be much more popular than the Electra. Best features: The Electra, being a near clone of the Ensign, has many of the same stats, which make her relatively fast for her day (though definitely not faster relative to more recent designs). Some say she is better looking than many of the cruisers in her size range. Worst features: Compared to the Hunter 22, her comp[etitor] other than the Ensign, she generally has less headroom. Her draft is deep enough for casual racing, but wouldn't stand up to many deeper-draft keelboats or shallower boats with centerboards (unless her extremely high PHRF rating could be brought to bear)."

Club career
He made his debut in the Russian Football National League for FC Spartak-2 Moscow on 14 November 2018 in a game against FC Sibir Novosibirsk.

It Ain't Me, Babe was a newspaper published in 1970 by Berkeley Women’s Liberation, a feminist organization. The paper has been called "the first feminist newspaper," although that distinction may only be accurate within Second-wave feminism in the United States. The newspaper debuted with an issue dated January 15, 1970. It published at least 15 issues, but was in operation for less than a year. 

Among the newspaper's producers were feminist Laura X and comic artist Trina Robbins, who worked on a special comics edition, also titled It Ain't Me, Babe.

The newspaper advocated a decentralized feminism movement: "We must keep in mind that we are a movement not an organization. Our movement can and will be composed of many action organizations differentiated by their political orientation — rather than a single organization that attempts to represent everyone's politics." It called for global solidarity among women, critiqued male-dominated culture, opposed US wars in southeast Asia, advocated women's self defense, and published a first-person account of rape.

Ritchie Aaron Whorton (born March 4, 1960) is an American politician who has served in the Alabama House of Representatives from the 22nd district since 2014.
Daniel Reed Crenshaw (born March 14, 1984) is an American politician and former United States Navy SEAL officer serving as the United States representative for Texas's 2nd congressional district since 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Crenshaw was commissioned in the United States Navy, and served on SEAL Team 3 in the War in Afghanistan, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. He was wounded in action during his third deployment, losing his right eye to an improvised explosive device. He served as a legislative assistant to Representative Pete Sessions, and was elected to Congress in the 2018 midterm election to succeed the retiring Ted Poe.

Early life and education 
Born to American parents in Aberdeen, Scotland, Crenshaw grew up in Katy, Texas. His mother died of cancer when he was ten years old. His father, Jim Crenshaw, is a petroleum engineer who worked abroad, and Crenshaw spent time growing up in Ecuador and Colombia, developing proficiency in Spanish. In 2002, he graduated from Colegio Nueva Granada in Bogotá, Colombia.

After high school, Crenshaw returned to the United States and attended Tufts University, graduating in 2006 with a Bachelor of Arts in international relations and a minor in physics. After a decade of military service, he studied public administration at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, receiving a Master of Public Administration in 2017. He worked as a military legislative assistant for U.S. Representative Pete Sessions.

Military service 
While at Tufts, Crenshaw joined the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps and received an officer's commission in the U.S. Navy after graduation. He received orders to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S) at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. After six months of training, Crenshaw graduated with BUD/S class 264. He completed SEAL qualification training in June 2008 and received the 1130 designator as a Naval Special Warfare Officer, entitled to wear the Special Warfare Insignia. Crenshaw served for ten years and five tours of duty, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. His first deployment was to Fallujah, Iraq, where he joined SEAL Team Three. He was based out of Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in Coronado, California.

As a Navy SEAL, Crenshaw was awarded two Bronze Star Medals, one with "V" device, the Purple Heart, and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with valor. He medically retired from military service in 2016 with the rank of lieutenant commander.

Crenshaw lost his right eye in 2012 during his third deployment when he was hit by an IED explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand Province. The blast destroyed his eye, and he required surgery to save the vision in his left eye. He remained in the Navy for four years after the injury, and served his fourth and fifth tours of duty in Bahrain and South Korea.

U.S House of Representatives

Elections

2018 

In 2018, Crenshaw ran for the United States House of Representatives in , which includes northern and western Houston, including Kingwood, Humble, Atascocita, Spring, and the Rice University area, to succeed the retiring Ted Poe. He announced his candidacy in November 2017. Crenshaw credited national security analyst John Noonan for encouraging him to run for Congress. In a February 2018 interview, he said that border security and immigration reform would be two of his campaign issues.

Crenshaw and Kevin Roberts advanced from the nine-candidate first round of the Republican primary election to face each other in a runoff election; Crenshaw received 155 votes more than Kathaleen Wall, a candidate backed by Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Greg Abbott. The lead-up to the runoff election was contentious. A super PAC funded by Roberts' brother-in-law, Mark Lanier, focused on Crenshaw's 2015 criticisms of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, despite Roberts having also been critical of Trump in the past. The ads also compared Crenshaw's policy proposals to those of President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gaining the endorsement of Senator Tom Cotton, Crenshaw received national attention, appearing in print and television, including on Laura Ingraham's show on Fox Business.

Crenshaw won the runoff to advance to the November general election. On November 6, he defeated Democratic nominee Todd Litton, 52.8% to 45.6%. After the election, Crenshaw called for the depoliticization of comedy and sports and expressed a desire that political rhetoric be toned down.

On the November 3 episode of Saturday Night Live, comedian Pete Davidson joked about the appearances of multiple candidates in the 2018 midterm elections and described Crenshaw as looking like a "hit man in a porno movie" while adding that he lost his eye in "war or whatever". The joke received widespread criticism and on the following episode, Davidson and Crenshaw appeared on air together. Davidson offered an apology, which Crenshaw accepted. Crenshaw also used the segment to advocate for veterans' issues. Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke may have helped him win, as well as aided later fundraising.

2020 

Crenshaw was reelected in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Sima Ladjevardian from Houston, Texas with 55.6% of the vote to Ladjevardian's 42.8%. During the campaign, he spent over $11 million through October 16, 2020, making it one of the most expensive Congressional races in the country.

2022 

Crenshaw was reelected in 2022, defeating Democratic nominee Robin Fulford by 66% to 34%.

Tenure 

Crenshaw spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention on August 26, 2020.

The Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs implicated Crenshaw and V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie in a 2020 report as having engaged in a campaign of disparagement toward a female veteran who reported sexual assault to the Navy. Crenshaw said, "The Democrats created this narrative".

Crenshaw is publicly critical of the Freedom Caucus, whom he regards as divisive "performance artists" for constantly attacking moderate Republicans.

Political positions

Abortion 
Crenshaw opposes abortion. In 2019, he received a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee. He has said that "life starts at conception", that he believes Roe v. Wade was a "bad precedent to set", and that abortion rights "should be decided by the states". When the Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned Roe, Crenshaw released the statement: "Historic. The issue goes back to the states, back to the people."

Gun rights 
Crenshaw opposes gun control measures, including bans on semi-automatic firearms. In response to the shootings in Dayton and El Paso, he suggested exploring red flag laws as a possible solution to gun violence. But after the 2022 Robb Elementary school shooting, Crenshaw partially retreated from the idea, arguing that such laws should be discussed at state level rather than nationally, saying, "What you're essentially trying to do with a red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken, and that's a really difficult thing to do" and "if there's such a threat that they're threatening somebody with a weapon already, then they've already broken the law, so why do you need this other law?" Crenshaw has also said that raising the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21 is ineffective but supports expanding background checks to include juvenile criminal history.

In 2020, Crenshaw received a 92% rating from the National Rifle Association.

COVID-19 pandemic 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Crenshaw said that Democrats and the media were exaggerating the threat. He was a high-profile defender of Trump's response to the pandemic. He did not wear face masks consistently in settings advised by health experts and mandated by Governor Greg Abbott.

Crenshaw argued that FDA regulations impeded the development of COVID-19 tests.

Healthcare 
Crenshaw favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), describing it as an "unmitigated disaster". During his 2018 campaign, he advocated allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, becoming one of a handful of Republicans to endorse what was primarily a progressive idea. By 2019, however, Crenshaw had retreated from this position.

On May 24, 2019, Crenshaw co-sponsored a bill to extend time limits for claims under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act.

Donald Trump 

According to Politico, Crenshaw "voted with Donald Trump most of the time but isn't a loyalist. He's a stalwart conservative willing to criticize other conservatives."

Although Crenshaw had criticized some of Trump's statements in a 2015 Facebook post, he became a "staunch defender" of Trump after the 2016 election. He voted against both articles of impeachment the House of Representatives brought against Trump in 2019.

In 2020, Crenshaw defended the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a video Trump retweeted, Crenshaw rebutted criticisms that the Trump administration had been slow in responding to the virus.

Crenshaw spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, calling the United States "a country of heroes." He was one of few convention speakers not to mention Trump.

After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump refused to concede, Crenshaw was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the election. The lawsuit claimed that the four swing states that Biden won had taken "unconstitutional actions", and invoked baseless claims of fraud. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

Crenshaw criticized the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack perpetrated by Trump supporters, and said that Trump should have ordered the rioters to stop. During the siege, he urged the protesters to "Stop this bullshit right now" on Twitter. Crenshaw condemned the rioting and some of his fellow congressional Representatives for "saying constantly this is our time to fight." While not naming any politicians, Crenshaw stated they were "lying to millions" and scattered when there was an actual threat to the Capitol. He deemed efforts to fight the Electoral College vote certification unconstitutional, and voted against the objections to the electoral vote in both Arizona and Pennsylvania, but defended Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley against allegations that they stoked the riot. Crenshaw voted against the Trump impeachment on January 13, 2021. In a statement, Crenshaw said that while Trump's words had encouraged "unconstitutional theories that risk the stability of our nation", he had voted against the second impeachment because he felt Democrats had "rushed" the process and that impeaching a president who only had seven days left in office would serve little purpose and inflame further tensions.

After Liz Cheney was censured for voting to impeach Trump, Crenshaw asserted in an interview that the Republican Party needed "to move on" from claims the 2020 election was stolen, but also accused the media of continuing to weaponize the issue, arguing both were ignoring larger issues such as the economy, the COVID pandemic and illegal immigration. He also said, "I do not think Trump is the devil, and I won't say that; I don't think he's Jesus either." Crenshaw also supported Representative Adam Kinzinger, who sat on the January 6 select committee and is publicly critical of Trump, and criticized far-right members of the Freedom Caucus as "performance artists" and "grifters".

In 2022, on his podcast Hold These Truths, Crenshaw criticized Republicans who contested the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying of their efforts, "It was always a lie. The whole thing was always a lie. And it was a lie meant to rile people up".

Election reform 
In 2019, Crenshaw voiced opposition to the For the People Act of 2019, saying it would "limit free speech drastically". He also said the bill would use taxpayer money to "legalize" the kind of electoral fraud that he alleges occurred on the Republican side in the 2018 election for North Carolina's District 9. PolitiFact rated Crenshaw's assertion about the North Carolina race "false", adding, "nothing in the bill that expands who can collect absentee ballots, allows people to fill out ballots for others, or loosens witnessing procedures for absentee ballots", as happened in that election. Crenshaw argued that the bill did not include a federal ban on ballot harvesting, and supported the American Civil Liberties Union's opposition to it over new campaign contribution revisions.

Environment 

During Crenshaw's 2018 campaign, his website made brief mention of global warming, applauding Trump for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords. Crenshaw called the agreement "costly and meaningless", virtue signaling, and bad policy. He also said, "We must use our money to develop better infrastructure." In 2018, Crenshaw called for a debate on the causes of climate change, adding, "We can't start off the conversation saying the climate is settled. The right way to have this conversation is to actually listen to what the science says on both sides."

In 2019, Crenshaw said, "climate change is occurring and that man-made emissions play a part in that. What isn't clear is how our actions will serve to reverse that warming trend, and what the cost-benefit outcome would be. Regardless, we should continue pursuing new green energy solutions that lessen our impact on the environment and create cleaner air and water." In 2020, he criticized solar and wind energy as "silly solutions" that "don't work," and instead advocated expanding nuclear energy and carbon capture technology.

During the 2021 Texas power crisis, Crenshaw argued that the Green New Deal would lead to similar crises.

Immigration 
In 2016, Crenshaw harshly criticized then-candidate Trump's "insane rhetoric" toward Muslims and "hateful" speech. During Crenshaw's 2018 campaign, he defended Trump's proposal to build a border wall on the Mexico–United States border. In a May 2019 appearance on The View, he claimed that 80%–90% of asylum seeker requests "don't have a valid asylum claim"; news outlet PolitiFact called the claim "false", writing that although only 20% to 30% of asylum claims are granted, "experts said there are many reasons why cases might be closed or requests might be denied, regardless of the merits of a claim." In 2021, Crenshaw accused the Biden administration of provoking a crisis on the southern border by having a moratorium on deportations and reversing Trump's policies on asylum and illegal immigration. He has also argued that Mexican drug cartels have fueled illegal immigration by taking advantage of the U.S. asylum process to smuggle people into the country.

Crenshaw supports enforcing physical barriers and implementing technology at the southern border to prevent illegal immigration. He has also expressed a belief that people who try to enter the U.S. illegally "aren't bad people" but "they are breaking the law, and they're contributing to an unsustainable system" and are "cutting in front of the line of all the legal immigrants."

Crenshaw voted for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020. He also voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).

Social issues 
Crenshaw believes that government should not be involved in regulating marriage and has expressed support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2015, he took issue with people trying to suggest Christianity is as shocking and as violent as Islam, saying, "the worst thing modern Christianity stands for is anti-homosexual marriage, which is a far cry from sex slaves, sharia law and beheadings."

In the case of a 7-year-old who at the age of 3 began to identify as a girl after being assigned male at birth and was the subject of a custody battle in which the father opposed and the mother supported the child's gender transition, Crenshaw opined in favor of the father. Following a judge's decision to grant custody to the mother, Crenshaw called it "heartbreaking" and added, "[a] 7-year-old can't possibly make this decision or understand it. Parents should know better. I hope this father receives the public support he needs."

Crenshaw opposes federal funding to "subsidize college in general", but supports it in cases of vocational training. He opposes cancel culture, and athletes kneeling during the national anthem. He called Senator Tammy Duckworth unpatriotic for wanting a discussion on which statues to remove, including those of George Washington.

Foreign policy 
Crenshaw supports cooperation with and support for Israel. During some of his public appearances, he has been targeted by anti-semitic white nationalists, known as Groypers, for his pro-Israel views.

In 2019, Crenshaw co-sponsored a resolution opposing Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, saying that it would embolden the Turkish military's assault on the Kurdish forces. He supported Trump's decision to kill Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani.

In April 2020, Crenshaw and Senator Tom Cotton introduced a bill that would allow civil suits against foreign states in incidents related to injury or death. The legislation came in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for the Chinese government to be held accountable for "allow[ing] this virus to spread".

In 2022, Crenshaw voiced support for a $40 billion aid package to Ukraine. Fox News political commentator Tucker Carlson criticized him for this, calling Crenshaw "Eyepatch McCain"—a remark that itself drew much criticism.

In April 2021, Crenshaw suffered a detached retina in his functional left eye, undergoing emergency surgery. As he recovered, he expected to be virtually blind for about a month. He said, "I don't have a 'good eye,' but half a good eye."

Awards and recognition 
In 2020, Fortune magazine included Crenshaw in its 40 Under 40 in the "Government and Politics" category, writing that he "wears his service to his country on his face."

Los Tomases Chapel is a historic building in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The chapel was built in the 1920s to serve the late-19th-century North Valley neighborhood of Los Tomases, and remained in occasional use in the 1980s. It was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1983 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

The chapel is a one-story adobe building in the New Mexico vernacular style. It is approximately rectangular in plan with a polygonal apse. The building has a corrugated metal gable roof with exposed rafters and a three-sided hipped section at the rear. Both the east and west sides have three arched, wood-framed 1-over-1 sash windows, and the front entrance has wooden double doors with a transom.

He is a member of the joint legislative procedure, judiciary, legislative procedure, and state affairs committees.
The Sainte-Rita Chapel is a Roman Catholic chapel located at 65 Boulevard de Clichy in the 9th arrondissement of Paris opposite the Moulin Rouge. Dedicated to Saint Rita of Cascia, the patron saint of lost causes, the chapel was inaugurated in 1956 to serve the prostitutes of the Pigalle, then a busy red-light district. It is affiliated with the nearby Église de la Sainte-Trinité.

History
The building contained the studio of Jean-Léon Gérôme from 1884 to 1900. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec may also have lived in the building at some stage.

The ground floor of the building was acquired in 1955 with the intention of bringing the Church's presence into prostitution in the area. After conversion, the chapel was inaugurated in 1956 by Canon Emmanuel Lancrenon, the then pastor of the parish of St. Trinity. The chapel was renovated in 2007. The facade features a stained glass window featuring Saint Rita clutching a pair of red roses, the rose being one of the saint's symbols.

Current situation
Although prostitution has fallen in the surrounding district, and the congregation has become more diverse, the chapel maintains its connection with prostitution. The chapel organises outreach services 5 nights a week to the remaining prostitutes in the area. Father Pierre-Oliviers Picard, chaplain of the chapel recalls "Prostitution is less visible today. When I was a child, there was a prostitute every ten meters at noon. Today, there are about fifteen at night."

Starting in 2011, the chapel has partnered with the organisation Aux captifs la libération to provide a drop-in centre for prostitutes and the homeless near the chapel. The centre is staffed by volunteers.

The League War was the second civil war of Costa Rica, as a member state of the Federal Republic of Central America. It passed between September and October 1835 in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Its immediate trigger was the repeal of the "Ambulance Law", the law that established the rotation of the country's capital among the four constituent cities. The most important consequence was the triumph of the city of San José over the cities of Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago (which formed the League of Three Cities, thus the name), which allowed its consolidation as the capital of Costa Rica.

Background
The conflict was a product of the political inexperience of the Costa Ricans in the years after Independence from Spain, and of the local disputes in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Cartago had been the capital of the Province of Costa Rica from 1563 to 1823 (260 years) until the Ochomogo War in 1823 when San José became the new capital of the Free State of Costa Rica, as part of the Federal Republic of Central America.

In 1833 Cartago citizens choose José Rafael de Gallegos y Alvarado as Head of State of Costa Rica expecting to see the return of the capital to Cartago. The plan was to establish the "Ambulance Law" so that the capital would be passed to Alajuela, Heredia, and when it arrived in Cartago the Law would be abolished.

In March 1834 the Congress of Costa Rica, marked at that time by localism, approved the Ambulance Law, and the capital was transferred to the town of Alajuela. This movement of all the documents and resources of the state government to a small village resulted in many setbacks that rendered the State inoperative.

In San Jose, the opposition to the government of Gallegos established a newspaper called La Tertulia to mock the Head of State, the Ambulance Law, and the peasants of Alajuela. In this way, in March 1835 Gallegos resigned as Head of State. In his place the law graduate and neighbor of San José Braulio Carrillo Colina was elected, who almost immediately repealed the Ambulance Law.

The Congress decided that a new capital should be founded in a neutral space. For this they chose the area known as San Juan del Murciélago, modern day Tibás, between San José and Heredia. While the necessary buildings were being built there, the Executive and Judicial powers would reside in San José, and the Parliament in Heredia.

The repeal of the Ambulance Law caused great displeasure in Cartago, and the people of Alajuela protested for the removal of the capital from their town (Alajuela had to be the capital until 1838).

On the 26 September 1835 the city of Cartago ignored the government of Braulio Carrillo and appointed the coffee grower Nicolás Ulloa Soto as Head of State to re-establish the Ambulance Law. Almost immediately Alajuela accepted the Ulloa government. A few days later Heredia joined the fight against San José, completing the League of Three Cities. This is how the Second Civil War of Costa Rica began.

Combatants
In early October the militias of Cartago, Alajuela and Heredia besieged San José, blocking all their exits and entrances with artillery, infantry and cavalry riders.

There were negotiations between the government and the insurgents before the outbreak of hostilities, to avoid the bloodshed. However, negotiations broke down on the 9 October when the Cartago militia, with some 1,300 men under Colonel Máximo Cordero and using the statue of the Virgin of the Angels as a standard, attacked San José by Curridabat.

The government of Braulio Carrillo Colina entrusted General Antonio Pinto Soares (veteran and hero of the Battle of Ochomogo) and Sergeant Major Manuel Quijano with the defence of San José. The soldiers and citizens dug trenches and erected barricades as quickly as possible, and the San Jose militia went into combat.

At the same time the forces of Alajuela and Heredia, with some 3,000 men under the command of Alajuela Colonel José Ángel Soto, invaded San Juan del Murciélago.

War

Battle of Cuesta de Moras
On the morning of the 14 October the men of the San José militia under the command of Sergeant Major Manuel Quijano stopped the advance of the Cartaginese in Cuesta de Moras. After a violent battle, the Cartago militia began to retreat towards what is now known as Barrio La California, from where it was clear that they had been defeated. Trying to escape from the Josefine troops, the Cartaginese were again defeated in Curridabat and Ochomogo. That same night, Sergeant Major Manuel Quijano took the city of Cartago.

The historian Ricardo Fernández Guardia, says that "... the greatest trophy was the miraculous image of the Virgin of the Angels, which the Cartaginese left abandoned in Curridabat." The sacred statue belonged to the Parish of San José until 1842, when the Cartaginese brought General Francisco Morazán to overthrow Braulio Carrillo.

Battle of the Virilla River
After these events, the militias of Alajuela and Heredia left San Juan del Murciélago and barricaded themselves on the banks of the Virilla River.

On the morning of 28 October, about 1,000 soldiers from San Jose under General Antonio Pinto Soares attacked the rebel trenches with artillery and bayonets. The rebels, in a total disorder, ordered the withdrawal to Heredia to build barricades. However, Heredians and Alajuelans were defeated in a number of following engagements. Finally, Heredia and Alajuela were occupied the night of the 28 October.

Thus ended the civil war, and San José was consolidated as the capital of the Free State of Costa Rica.

Aftermath
After San José was consolidated as the capital of Costa Rica. Some leaders of the League left the country. Others were locked in jail. The commander of the Cuartel de Cartago, Sergeant Major Francisco Roldán, was shot for treason (he handed over the arsenal to the rebels). However, in 1838 the government decreed a general amnesty in for all those who were implicated in the 1835 uprising.
Venice Tavern is a dive bar in the Highlandtown neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland.  The bar opened in 1933, when Frank Sr and Victoria DeSantis converted their basement and added an exterior staircase to access it from outside of their Conkling Street row house.  The 3-story mansion above the bar was originally built in 1920 for William Schluderberg of C., a member of the William Schluderberg & Son meat packing family, and now houses a local and organic farmers market store.

History
Established in 1933, just after the repeal of prohibition, a portrait of then-president Franklin Delano Roosevelt behind the bar continues to pay tribute to Venice's founding history.  Venice was established by Italian immigrants Frank and Mary Victoria DeSantis Sr., and while Mary hailed from Naples in Southern Italy, her love of Venice gave the bar its name.

At the time of the bar's founding, Highlandtown was home to working-class Polish, German and Italian families, and the simple, affordable (at 15 cents) beer offerings reflected the tastes of the neighborhood.  Venice was run by the husband-wife duo for three decades.  Frank Sr. died in 1962, and Mary ran the bar herself until her own death in 1967, after which control passed to their two sons, Frank Jr. and Vince DeSantis. Frank DeSantis Jr. turned the bar over to his son Dominic DeSantis in 2006. While not changing the aesthetic character of the bar, Dominic acknowledged shifts in the composition of the neighborhood and tastes, introducing various craft beers to the taps at Venice, but keeping the low prices which had made it locally notable. In recent years, Venice has participated in various tap takeovers and regional craft brewery features. It has also been a featured stop on annual walking tours during Baltimore Beer Week.

The success of Venice eventually allowed the DeSantis family to expand bar or restaurant operations to Little Italy (Venice Tavern Little Italy, formerly Dego Dames), Canton (Hudson Street Stackhouse) and Perry Hall (DeSantis Pizza Grill & Bar).

Accolades
Despite its small size, Venice has received frequent write ups and recommendations in local, regional and national publications as a surviving example of the archetypal Baltimore corner bar.

Baltimore City Paper dubbed Venice the "Craft Beer Underground," due to the combination of its low prices and trendier craft beers. They also named it their "Best Dive Bar" in both their 2011 & 2017 Best of Baltimore lists. Tasting Table listed it nationally as one of "The Best Dive Bars in the U.S." in 2017. The budget price of its taps remains one of Venice's most notable aspects, often in contrast to bars in neighboring Canton, Brewers Hill and Fell's Point, with Highlandtown Main Street claiming it "offers, very possibly, the most inexpensive craft beer in the state." In opposition to what he saw as a rising trend of $6 beers, City Paper's Baynard Woods described Venice as "the bulwark against the brave new world where we are all willing to pay too much to get our buzz on just because."

Visitors and reviewers frequently comment on Venice's decor, which consists largely of dozens of boxing promotion posters and photographs from decades past, reflecting a time when boxing was a much more popular sport. Former co-owner Vince DeSantis was himself Highlandtown lightweight boxing champion in 1931, and maintains a listing in the Maryland Boxing Hall of Fame.

In a period of Baltimore's history where historic corner bars are frequently closing, Venice has drawn comment in spite of rapid and multiple demographic changes in the surrounding Highlandtown neighborhood, for remaining a fixture of the community and adapting to accommodate people of a variety of origins.

Lords of Middle-earth, Volume I is a 1986 fantasy role-playing game supplement published by Iron Crown Enterprises for Middle-earth Role Playing.

Contents
Lords of Middle-earth, Volume I is the first of three supplements that was intended to detail all the characters in the history of Middle-earth.

Reception
Graham Staplehurst reviewed Lords of Middle-earth, Volume I: The Immortals for White Dwarf #87, and stated that "There is no doubt that this book is very useful. It will be less use if you've already got a lot of the MERP packages, since the Valar and Maiar are unlikely to make many appearances, but for those who are interested in Tolkien's world and are running (or want to run) a campaign there, LOME is excellent source material."

J. Michael Caparula reviewed Lords of Middle-earth, Volume I in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 79. Caparula commented that "This format and amount of information here is terrific, but I'm anxious to see it applied to more down to earth types. I'd rather see my players encounter Faramir or Fatty Bolger than the likes of Ungoliant."

Kirklands Hospital is a mental health facility in Bothwell, Scotland. It is managed by NHS Lanarkshire.

History
The hospital, which was designed by Thomas Halket, was established by Dr William Dean Fairless as a private psychiatric facility for the "upper and middle classes" and opened as the Bothwell Asylum in June 1871. It was acquired by the Glasgow District Board of Lunacy in 1879 and, after being significantly expanded in the Scottish baronial style, reopened as the Kirklands District Asylum in 1881. It became Kirklands Mental Hospital in the 1920s and then joined the National Health Service as Kirklands Hospital in 1948.

After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and the old buildings were replaced by smaller modern assessment and treatment facilities. Since 2010, the site has also been used by NHS Lanarkshire as their headquarters and medical training centre.
Sylvan S. Byck (July 17, 1904 – July 8, 1982 (pronounced "bike") was an American editor and cartoonist, who was the comic strip editor for King Features Syndicate for over 30 years, in which position he evaluated "up to 2000 comics submissions a year."

Early life

Sylvan Byck was born July 17, 1904, in Otisville, New York.   After graduating from the Pratt Institute, Byck worked for various newspapers, including as an editorial cartoonist at the Brooklyn Times-Union and The Seattle Times.

Career
In 1937, Byck joined King Features Syndicate, where he edited Pictorial Review; during the Second World War, he served as "cable editor" for International News Service. In 1945, he became King's comics editor.

Among the multiple projects that he purchased were Mort Walker's Beetle Bailey (which he saved from cancellation by relaying to Walker the suggestion that the strip's college-student protagonist should join the United States Army) and Hi and Lois, for which Byck and Walker independently suggested recruiting Dik Browne as illustrator (Browne later recalled that, when first contacted by Byck, he assumed that it was Stan Drake playing a prank). As well, Byck suggested that Bob Weber produce a strip of his own; Weber subsequently created Moose Miller. Other strips in whose launching he was "instrumental" included Buz Sawyer, Redeye, Hazel, Trudy, The Lockhorns, Inside Woody Allen, and the Archie comic strip. As well, he "wrote the continuity story lines" for a variety of comic strips, including Secret Agent X-9 and Jungle Jim.

Byck was also responsible for ensuring the continuation of strips after their original creators were no longer available, including Little Iodine (where he arranged for Hy Eisman to succeed Bob Dunn — who was himself a successor to Jimmy Hatlo) and Rip Kirby (where he tried to recruit Leonard Starr to succeed Alex Raymond in the wake of Raymond's sudden death; Starr suggested that Byck instead hire John Prentice).<ref name=PrenticeReuben>NCS Spotlight On: John Prentice, at the National Cartoonists Society; published August 26, 2010; retrieved June 3, 2019</ref> However, in the case of Steve Canyon, Byck "dismissed the possibility of a successor" to the strip's creator Milt Caniff, on the grounds that Caniff "could never be imitated".

Byck was elected a vice president of King Features in 1964, and retired in 1978, succeeded by Bill Yates (who Byck had recruited in 1960 as the creator of Professor Phumble). Byck died at the age of 78 in Queens, New York, on July 8, 1982.

Praise

In 1977, Inklings Magazine (journal of the Museum of Cartoon Art) called Byck "the most influential man in newspaper comics in our generation", and in 1979, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him the Silver T-Square Award.

Mort Walker said that, of all the editors he met when he was beginning his career, Byck was "the most helpful and encouraging".

Criticism
Alex Toth stated that, when he applied to be the new illustrator for the Perry Mason comic strip, Byck told him that he would be required to imitate Alex Raymond's style rather than use his own; Toth refused, and subsequently noted that if Raymond had "witnessed the absurd lengths to which (Byck went) in imposing (Raymond's) style on other talents, he would be Byck's most vociferous detractor".

Stan Drake reported having been chastised by Byck for including too much emotional expression when drawing the faces of characters in The Heart of Juliet Jones''.

Aestuariicella is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative, and strictly aerobic genus of bacteria from the order Alteromonadales with one known species (Aestuariicella hydrocarbonica). Aestuariicella hydrocarbonica was first isolated in 2015 from oil spill contaminated tidal flat sediments from the Dangjin bay in Korea. Due to the recent nature of its discovery, its taxonomic classification has not yet been accepted.  Future research into its evolutionary history and genome may change the naming of this organism.

While rare in seawater, A. hydrocarbonica has shown a strong association with plastic debris of various polymer types. It is commonly found along with other  gammaproteobacteria capable of degrading hydrocarbons and other high-molecular-mass polymers.  Bio-degradation tests have shown that it is capable of breaking down a variety of hydrocarbon polymers. However, it does not degrade the plant polymers casein and starch . These organisms are tetracycline sensitive, but are vulnerable to all other common antibiotics.

The distribution of A. hydrocarbonica is not yet described, but studies have found its presence in samples from South Korea  and the Mediterranean Sea. This suggests that it may have a broad geographic distribution or be associated with area with high human impact.

was a Japanese social activist, business leader, writer, art patron, and occasional actor. In the West he is best known for his cameo appearances in several of the last films directed by Yasujirō Ozu.

Business Career
The son of a Kamakura railroad magnate, Sugawara became a real estate developer and industrialist, notably effecting the subdivision, improvement, and accessibility of Kamakurayama (the city's mountain district) as a high-end residential area in the 1930s. He bridged Ōfuna to the island of Enoshima with Japan's first toll road, and he developed and managed the region's Enoshima Electric Railway, which connects Kamakura with Fujisawa.

He served as president of Japan's Construction Industry Association and was instrumental in the restoration that followed the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923. A stone tablet near the Tsurugaoka Hachimangū shrine in Kamakura honors Sugawara for his contribution to the city's prosperity.

Civic Activity
Sugawara's driving ambition, his passion for Japanese public policy, and his status as a “noted man of independent means” led to his lifelong reputation as an influential “fixer.” The American Political Science Review asserted in 1948 that Sugawara headed Japan's powerful “contractor syndicate” and provided “generous” financial support to multiple rival political parties because he “want[ed] railway contracts.”

Among the politicians whose careers he cultivated was Shintaro Ishihara, a “disciple” of his who eventually became governor of Tokyo. As a backer of Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, Sugawara became embroiled in the Showa Denko corruption scandal that drove Ashida from office in 1948.

Social Reform Agenda
An active social reformer, Sugawara led a public crusade in postwar Japan against the “three vices” of prostitution, venereal disease, and narcotics abuse. His high-profile activities as founder and president of “The Society for the Banishment of the Three Evils” even included appearing in several crime films inspired by his campaign, three of which starred Sonny Chiba.

In addition to organizing his own efforts, Sugawara's top-level relationships enabled him to influence Japan's social policy through direct appointments by Prime Ministers to various councils and committees. In 1956 Prime Minister Ichirō Hatoyama established a Council on Prostitution Policy which was chaired by Sugawara, and the resulting Prostitution Prevention Law criminalized solicitation, procurement, and contracts for prostitution, though not the act of prostitution itself. Sugawara admitted that the compromise legislation contained loopholes but at least made it illegal to sell daughters into prostitution, and he suggested that if prostitution could not be eradicated, official regulation may become an option: “If [the law] is found to be completely unworkable, then all we have to do is scrap it. People might even think then that licensed prostitution is the only answer.”

In 1959, UPI reported a story about the plight of modern-day geisha that was culled from an article Sugawara had written for the magazine Bungei Shunju. Identified as a “financier, essayist, art connoisseur, and chairman of the council for the prevention of prostitution,” Sugawara decried that an estimated 27 percent of geisha were engaging in prostitution, a result of rising expenses associated with the lifestyle. (Citing the diminishing number and advancing average age of geisha in Japan, he also asserted that girls now “prefer[red] to become dancers, models, and cabaret and bar hostesses rather than start training in music and dancing at the age of seven or eight,” the traditional route required to become a full geisha by 18 or 19 years old.)

In the 1960s Sugawara chaired the Japanese National Committee for the Struggle Against Addiction to Drugs, estimating in 1965 that one-third of China's opium output was smuggled into Japan every year, pulling from its annual economy the 2021 equivalent of US$1.5 billion. Working with Shiro Nabarro, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and Chairman of both the Labor Committee and the Cabinet Commission on Narcotics Problems, Sugawara implemented a four-part plan he devised to end the nation's “serious threat” of heroin abuse in the early 1970s:

 To destroy the smuggling routes.
 To make the penalties for dealing more severe, including life imprisonment.
 To appeal to the general public for cooperation by enlightening them into the realization of the misery of narcotic addiction.
 To commit narcotic addicts to treatment centers and cure them at government expense.

The plan is credited with nearly eliminating the problem “in a very short time,” and as chairman of the Committee on Drug Abuse Control, which operated out of the Prime Minister's office, Sugawara served as a consultant to the U.S. government's National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse shortly thereafter.

Cultural Legacy
 Sugawara was an avid art collector, particularly of Japanese and Chinese antiquities, founding the Tokiwayama Bunko (Library) Foundation to hold and catalog his acquisitions, which the organization continues to display at special events and museum exhibitions. The foundation possesses one of the largest collections of bokuseki calligraphy, ceramics, and religious arts in Japan. Sugawara's son Hisao (Toshio) and grandson Ken (its current director) have served the organization in leadership roles.

Sugawara's numerous books and essays further attest to his devotion to Japanese cultural preservation, and he created many of his own traditional works of calligraphy and brush art.

In 1966, Prime Minister Eisaku Satō appointed Sugawara as chairman of the Council for National Foundation Day, which recommended the establishment of an official government holiday every February 11 to commemorate the founding of Japan. Through the holiday, which ultimately was adopted, the council also sought to reassert a sense of national pride in response to public disfavor toward patriotic expression following World War II, and this subtext for their efforts has subjected the holiday to controversy over the years.

A friend of Yasujirō Ozu, Sugawara appeared in seven of the director's last eight films, making him a ubiquitous presence in many of the most popular and accessible works of “one of the most influential and famous filmmakers in the history of Japanese cinema.” Beginning in Early Spring and excluding only The End of Summer, the brief roles enhance the movies’ historical resonance and cultural realism, featuring in-jokes such as social commentary by Sugawara or references to traits for which he was known, such as his business acumen or imposing personality.

For example, in Good Morning, the Ozu film in which a viewer is most likely to infer that Sugawara is playing himself, he is asked at a bar to comment on journalist Sōichi Ōya's 1957 warning that television was part of a mass media campaign to turn Japan into “a nation of 100 million idiots.” Sugawara leans back and says, “Yes. TV sets are a nuisance.” In Tokyo Twilight, the only one to feature his character in multiple scenes, he muses over a newspaper article announcing the end of legal prostitution in Japan.

Sugawara received a “special appearance” credit in Kurahara’s I Hate But Love (1962), briefly playing himself on a TV panel with star Yûjirô Ishihara, brother of his protege Shintaro Ishihara.
Niobium disulfide is the chemical compound with the formula NbS2. It is a black layered solid that can be exfoliated into ultrathin grayish sheets similar to other transition metal dichalcogenides. These layers exhibit superconductivity, where the transition temperature increases from ca. 2 to 6 K with the layer thickness increasing from 6 to 12 nm, and then saturates with thickness.
John Mickleburgh (c. 1692 – 11 May 1756) was an English chemist, and the third holder of the 1702 Chair of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge.

Early life 
Mickleburgh was born in Norwich, the son of Thomas Mickleburgh, a weaver.

Academic career
At age 17, on 30 May 1709, Mickleburgh was admitted a sizar at Caius, Cambridge. Shortly after he migrated to Corpus Christi, Cambridge, where he was made a Fellow in 1714. He secured the 1702 Chair of Chemistry in 1718, which he occupied until his death in 1756.

Among his students were John Morgan, Professor of Anatomy at Cambridge from 1728 to 1734, and his two immediate successors, George Cuthbert and Robert Bankes.
Alvaro Luis Tavares Vieira (born 10 March 1995) is a Brazilian football player who plays for Dila Gori, on loan from Lviv.

Esquieu de Floyran (Floyrac or Foyrac) was a prior of Montfaucon in the Abbey of Saint Martial in Limoges.

Native from Béziers, he spoke falsely and disloyally against the order of the Temple, and so became a traitor with Guillaume Robert, Bernard Pelet and Gérard de Boyzol. He then was imprisoned.

In 1308 he wrote a letter to the king of Aragon James II reminding him that when he visited him in Lerida in early 1305 he had given information about the order. Ponsard de Gizy, commanderie de Payns, mentioned him on 27 November 1309 as one of the detonators of the Trials of the Knights Templar.

The European Green Deal, approved in 2020, is a set of policy initiatives by the European Commission with the overarching aim of making the European Union (EU) climate neutral in 2050. The plan is to review each existing law on its climate merits, and also introduce new legislation on the circular economy, building renovation, biodiversity, farming and innovation. 

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stated that the European Green Deal would be Europe's "man on the moon moment". Von der Leyen appointed Frans Timmermans as Executive Vice President of the European Commission for the European Green Deal. On 13 December 2019, the European Council decided to press ahead with the plan, with an opt-out for Poland. On 15 January 2020, the European Parliament voted to support the deal as well, with requests for higher ambition. A year later, the European Climate Law was passed, which legislated that greenhouse gas emissions should be 55% lower in 2030 compared to 1990. The Fit for 55 package is a large set of proposed legislation detailing how the European Union plans to reach this target.

The European Commission's climate change strategy, launched in 2020, is focused on a promise to make Europe a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2050 and to demonstrate that economies will develop without increasing resource usage. However, the Green Deal has measures to ensure that nations that are already reliant on fossil fuels are not left behind in the transition to renewable energy. The green transition is a top priority for Europe. The EU Member States want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels, and become climate neutral by 2050.

European Climate Pact
The European Climate Pact is an initiative of the European Commission supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal. It is a movement to build a greener Europe, providing a platform to work and learn together, develop solutions, and achieve real change.

The Pact provides opportunities for people, communities, and organizations to participate in climate and environmental action across Europe. By pledging to the Pact, European stakeholders commit to taking concrete climate and environmental actions in a way that can be measured and/or followed up. Participating in the Pact is an opportunity for organizations to share their transition journey with their peers and collaborate with other actors towards common targets.

Aims
The overarching aim of the European Green Deal is for the European Union to become the world's first “climate-neutral bloc” by 2050. It has goals extending to many different sectors, including construction, biodiversity, energy, transport and food.

The plan includes potential carbon tariffs for countries that don't curtail their greenhouse gas pollution at the same rate. The mechanism to achieve this is called the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). It also includes:
 a circular economy action plan, The European Commission has released a number of publications on circular economy, including one that requires Member States to carry out activities related to changing their economies into circular economies. The CE has indeed become a key component of the European Green Deal and the Coronavirus Recovery Plan of the Von der Leyen Commission (2019–present), and it was a key component of the Juncker Commission's ambition to create a sustainable, low-carbon, resource-efficient, and competitive economy.
 a review and possible revision (where needed) of the all relevant climate-related policy instruments, including the Emissions Trading System,
 a Farm to Fork strategy along with a focus shift from compliance to performance (which will reward farmers for managing and storing carbon in the soil, improved nutrient management, reducing emissions, ...),
 a revision of the Energy Taxation Directive which is looking closely at fossil fuel subsidies and tax exemptions (aviation, shipping),
 a sustainable and smart mobility strategy and 
an EU forest strategy. The latter will have as its key objectives effective afforestation, and forest preservation and restoration in Europe.

It also leans on Horizon Europe, to play a pivotal role in leveraging national public and private investments. Through partnerships with industry and member States, it will support research and innovation on transport technologies, including batteries, clean hydrogen, low-carbon steel making, circular bio-based sectors and the built environment.

The EU plans to finance the policies set out in the Green Deal through an investment plan – InvestEU, which forecasts at least €1 trillion in investment. Furthermore, for the EU to reach its goals set out in the deal, it is estimated that approximately €260 billion a year is going to be required by 2030 in investments.

Before 1970, almost half of all European residential structures were built. At the time, no consideration was given to the amount of energy used by materials and standards. At the present rate of refurbishment, reaching a highly energy-efficient and decarbonised building stock might take more than a century. One of the major aims of the European Green Deal is to “at least double or even triple” the current refurbishment rate of approximately 1%. This is also true outside of the EU. In addition to rehabilitation, investment is required to enable the development of new efficient and ecologically friendly structures.

In July 2021, the European Commission released its “Fit for 55” legislation package, which contains important guidelines for the future of the automotive industry: All new cars sold in the EU must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.

In the context of the Paris Agreement, and therefore using today's emissions as baseline, since 1990 EU emissions already dropped by 25% at 2019, a 55% reduction target using 1990 as baseline represents in 2019 terms a 40% reduction target, which can be calculated using this equation: 

According to the Emissions Gap Report 2020 by the United Nations Environment Programme, meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5 °C temperature increase target (with 66% probability) requires GtCO2e 34/59 = 57% emissions reduction globally from 2019 levels by 2030, therefore well above the 40% target of the European Green Deal. This 57% emission reduction target at 2030 represents average global reductions, while advanced economies are expected to contribute more.

Policy areas

Clean energy 
Climate neutrality by the year of 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal. For the EU to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise their energy system by aiming to achieve “net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” Their relevant energy directive is intended to be looked over and adjusted if problem areas arise. Many other in place and present regulations will also be reviewed. In 2023, the Member states will update their climate and national energy plans to adhere to the EU's climate goal for 2030. 
The key principles include: 
 to “prioritise energy efficiency”
 to “develop a power sector based largely on renewable resources”,
 to secure an affordable EU energy supply
 and to have a “fully integrated, interconnected digitalised EU energy market.”
In 2020, the European Commission unveiled its strategy for a greener, cleaner energy future.
The EU Strategy for Energy System Integration serves as a framework for an energy transition, which comprises measures to achieve a more circular system, and measures to implement greater direct electrification as well as to develop clean fuels (including hydrogen). The European Clean Hydrogen Alliance has also been launched as hydrogen has a special role to play in this seismic shift.

Sustainable industry 
Another target area to achieve the EU's climate goals is the introduction of the Circular Economy Industrial policy. In March 2020, the EU announced their Industrial Strategy with its aim to “empower citizens, revitalises regions and have the best technologies.” Key points of this policy area include boosting the modern aspects of industries, influencing the exploration and creation of “climate neutral” circular economy friendly goods markets. This further entails the “decarbonisation and modernisation of energy-intensive industries such as steel and cement.”

A ‘Sustainable products’ policy is also projected to be introduced which will focus on reducing the wastage of materials. This aims to ensure products will be reused and recycling processes will be reinforced. The materials particularly focused on include “textiles, construction, vehicles, batteries, electronics and plastics.” The European Union is also of the opinion that it "should stop exporting its waste outside of the EU" and it will therefore "revisit the rules on waste shipments and illegal exports" The EU mentioned that "the Commission will also propose to revise the rules on end-of-life vehicles with a view to promoting more circular business models." The European Commission estimates that up to 2030, Europe's green investment offensive will cost an additional €350 billion annually.

Building and renovation 
This policy area is targeting the process of building and renovation in regards to their currently unsustainable methods. Many non-renewable resources are used in the process as well. Thus, the plan focuses on promoting the use of energy efficient building methods such as climate proofing buildings, increasing digitalisation and enforcing rules surrounding the energy performance of buildings. Social housing renovation will also occur in order to reduce the price of energy bills for those less able to finance these costs. They aim to triple the renovation rate of all buildings to reduce the pollution emitted during these processes.

Digital technologies are important in achieving the European Green Deal's environmental targets. Emerging digital technologies, if correctly applied, have the potential to play a critical role in addressing environmental issues. Smart city mobility, precision agriculture, sustainable supply chains, environmental monitoring, and catastrophe prediction are just a few examples.

Farm to Fork 
The ‘From Farm to Fork’ strategy pursues the issue of food sustainability as well as the support allocated to the producers, i.e. farmers and fishermen. The methods of production and transfer of these resources are what the E.U. considers a climate-friendly approach, aiming to increase efficiency as well. The price and quality of the goods will aim to not be hindered during these newly adopted processes. Specific target areas include reducing the use of chemical pesticides, increasing the availability of health food options and aiding consumers to understand the health ratings of products and sustainable packaging.

In the official page of the program From Farm to Fork is cited Frans Timmermans the Executive Vice-president of the European Commission, saying that:

The program includes the next targets:

 Making 25% of EU agriculture organic, by 2030.
 Reduce by 50% the use of pesticides by 2030.
 Reduce the use of Fertilizers by 20% by 2030.
 Reduce nutrient depletion by at least 50%.
 Reduce the use of antimicrobials in agriculture and antimicrobials in aquaculture by 50% by 2030.
 Create sustainable food labeling.
 Reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.
 Dedicate to R&I related to the issue €10 billion.

Eliminating pollution 
The ‘Zero Pollution Action Plan’ that aims to be adopted by the commission in 2021 intends to achieve no pollution from “all sources”, cleaning the air, water and soil by 2050. The Environment Quality standards are to be fully met, enforcing all industrial activities to be within toxic-free environments. Agricultural and urban industries water management policies will be overlooked to suit the “no harm” policy. Harmful resources such as micro-plastics and chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, that are threatening the environment aim to be substituted in order to reach this goal. The ‘Farm to Fork’ strategy aids pollution reduction from excess nutrients and sustainable methods of production and transportation.

Some formulations of the plan such as "toxic-free" and "zero pollution" have been criticized by Genetic Literacy Project as anti-scientific and contradictory, as any substance can be toxic at specific dose, and almost any life-related process results in "pollution".

Sustainable mobility 
A reduction in emissions from transportation methods is another target area within the European Green Deal. A comprehensive strategy on "Sustainable and Smart mobility" intends to be implemented. This will increase the adoption of sustainable and alternative fuels in road, maritime and air transport and fix the emission standards for combustion-engine vehicles. It also aims to make sustainable alternative solutions available to businesses and the public. Smart traffic management systems and applications intend to be developed as a solution. Freight delivery methods aim to be altered, with preferred pathways being by land or water. Public transport alterations aim to reduce public congestion as well as pollution. Installations of charging ports for electric vehicles intends to encourage the purchase of low-emission vehicles. The ‘Single European Sky’ plan focuses on air traffic management in order to increase safety, flight efficiency and environmentally friendly conditions.

Biodiversity 
A strategy surrounding the protection of the European Union's biodiversity will be put forth in 2021. Management of forests and maritime areas, environment protection and addressing the issue of losses of species and ecosystems are all aspects of this target area.

Restoration of affected ecosystems is intended to occur through implementing organic farming methods, aiding pollination processes, restoring free flowing rivers, reducing pesticides that harm surrounding wildlife and reforestation. The EU wants to protect 30% of land and 30% of sea, whilst creating stricter safeguards around new and old growth forests. Their aim is to restore ecosystems and their biological levels.

The official page of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 cites Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, saying that:

The biodiversity strategy is an essential part of the climate change mitigation strategy of the European Union. From the 25% of the European budget that will go to fight climate change, a large portion of that will be dedicated to restoring biodiversity and nature based solutions.

The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 includes the following targets:

 Protect 30% of the sea territory and 30% of land territory especially primary forests and old-growth forests. 
 Plant 3 billion trees by 2030.
 Restore at least 25,000 kilometers of rivers, so they will become free-flowing.
 Reduce the use of pesticides by 50% by 2030.
 Increase organic farming. 
 Increase biodiversity in agriculture.
 Reverse the decline of pollinators.
 Give €20 billion per year to the issue and make it part of the business practice.

According to the page, approximately half of the global GDP depends on nature. In Europe many parts of the economy that generate trillions € per year, depend on nature. Currently the benefits of Natura 2000 in Europe contribute €200 - €300 billion per year. Florika Fink-Hooijer, Director General of the Directorate-General for the Environment, said that the EU has the “ambition to be a standard setter" for global biodiversity policy.

In July 2023 after many debates the European parliament adopted a version of the Nature restoration law, aiming to restore nature on 20% of the territory of EU by 2030.

Sustainable finance

Motivation 
The main aim of the European Green Deal is to become climate neutral by the year of 2050. The reasons pushing for the plan's creation are based upon the environmental issues such as climate change, a loss of biodiversity, ozone depletion, water pollution, urban stress, waste production and more. The following statistics highlight the climate related issues within the European Union:

 In regards to climate change, carbon dioxide levels are predicted to double by the year of 2030 with Europe's temperature expected to increase by 2-3 °C in the summer season.
 Europe is responsible for nearly one third of the world's gas emissions that deplete the ozone.
 More than 50% of all surface area where ecosystems are in Europe are presented with threats from management problems and stresses.
 On average, 700,000 hectares of woodland are burnt annually by fires “often caused by socioeconomic factors” within the European Union, leading to the degradation of forests.

Clean energy statistics 
 More than 75% of greenhouse gas emissions are related to the production and use of energy within the EU.
 Positive of renewable resources- Renewable resources sourced 17.5% of the EU's gross energy consumption in 2017.

Sustainable industry statistics 
 Studies showed that from the year of 1970 to 2017, the world's yearly extraction of resources tripled. This process is responsible for 90% of all loss in biodiversity.  
 The European Union's current industry is responsible for 20% of their greenhouse gas emissions.
 The current resources that originate from recycling methods is 12% within the European Union's industry.

Building and renovations statistics 
 The building and renovation methods used by the European Union use 40% of all energy consumed.

Farm to fork statistics 
 Within the European Union, “20% of food production is wasted” whilst “36 million of the population are unable to have quality meal every second day.”

Eliminating pollution statistics 
 From the 50,000 industrial locations in the EU, up to €189 billion is spent on health issues related to pollution from these installations.

Sustainable mobility statistics 
 25% of Greenhouse gas emissions result from transportation methods. Road transport takes 71.7% of this total, followed by 13.9% from Aviation, 13.4% from Water, with railways and other accumulating the remainder.
 The Single European Sky strategy is predicted to help reduce 10% of aviation emissions.

Biodiversity 

 Within the EU, €40 trillion depends on nature and its resources.
 The population of wild species has declined by over 50% on average in the last two generations.

All 54 actions were adopted or implemented by 2019. The EU is now recognised as a leader in circular economy policy making globally. The waste legislation was adopted in 2018, following negotiations with the European Parliament and Member States in the European Council. According to Eurostat, jobs related to circular economy activities have increased by 6% between 2012 and 2016 within the EU. The action plan has also encouraged at least 14 Member States, eight regions, and 11 cities to put forward circular economy strategies.

Recovery program from the novel coronavirus 

With the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic spreading rapidly within the European Union, the focus on the European Green Deal diminished. Many leaders including the deputy minister, Kowalski, from Poland, a Romanian politician, and the Czech prime minister, Babiš, suggested either a yearly pause or a complete discontinuation of the deal. Many believe the current main focus of the European Union's current policymaking process should be the immediate, shorter-term crisis rather than climate change.

The financial market being under immense stress along with a reduction in economic activity is another factor threatening to derail the European Green Deal. Public and private funds for the policy as well as the EU's GDP being affected by COVID-19 both hinder the budgeting for the policy to take action.

However, as recovery processes have begun within the European Union, a large majority of ministers are supporting the push for the deal to begin, alongside the subsiding of the first wave of infections. Representatives from 17 governments signed a letter in mid-April pushing for the deal to continue as a “response to the economic crisis while transforming Europe into a sustainable and climate neutral economy.”

In April 2020, the European Parliament called for including the European Green Deal in its economic recovery program. Ten countries urged the European Union to adopt the “green recovery plan" as fears grew that the economic hit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could weaken action on climate change.

In May 2020 the leaders of the European Commission argued that the ecological crisis helped create the pandemic, which emphasised the need to advance the European Green Deal. Later that month, the €750 billion European recovery package (called Next Generation EU) and the €1 trillion budget were announced. The European Green Deal is part of it. The money will be spent only on projects that meet certain green criteria. 25% of all funding will go to climate change mitigation. Fossil fuels and Nuclear power are excluded from the funding. The recovery package is also intended to restore some equilibrium between rich and poor countries in the European Union.

As part of the European Union response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several economic programs were set up, including the CRII, CRII+, European Social Fund+ and REACT-EU With these programs, flexibility is maintained, and CRII and CRII+ are also able to direct money to crisis repair measures through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF), Fund for European Aid to Most Deprived (FEAD) or the European Social Fund Plus. Some of these programs (such as REACT-EU) also serve to invest in the European Green Deal.

In July 2020, a proposed "Green Recovery Act" in the United Kingdom was published by a think tank and academic group, implementing all recommendations of a “Green New Deal” for Europe (which is distinct from the EU Green Deal) and drawing attention to the fact that "car manufacturers in Europe are far behind China" in ending fossil fuel-based production.

The same month, the recovery package and the budget of the European Union were generally accepted. The portion of the money that was allocated for climate action grew to 30%. The plan includes some green taxation on European products and on imports, but critics say it is still not enough for achieving the climate targets of the European Union and it is not clear how to ensure that all the money will really go to green projects.

History of opposition by countries 
Although all EU leaders signed off on the European green deal in December 2019, disagreements in regards to the goals and their timeline to achieve each factor arose. Poland has stated that climate neutrality by 2050 will not be a possibility for their country due to their reliance on coal as their main power source. Their climate minister, Michał Kurtyka, declared that commitments and funds need to be more fairly allocated. The initiative to increase the goal of lowering carbon emissions split the EU, with the coal reliant countries such as Poland complaining it will affect “jobs and competitiveness.” Up to 41,000 jobs could be lost within Poland, with the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania also having a possible loss of 10,000 jobs each. Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babiš, stated that their nation will not reach the 2050 goal “without nuclear” association. Countries are also arguing over the Just Transition Fund (JTF) that aims to help countries who are reliant on coal to become more environmentally friendly. These countries that changed their impacts prior to the Policy, such as Spain, believe that the JTF is unfair as it only benefits the countries that didn't "go green earlier." The head of Brussels' office of the Open Europe think tank, Pieter Cleppe, further dismissed the plan with sarcastic comment, “What could possibly go wrong.”

Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that the EU's carbon pricing system unfairly disadvantages poorer countries in Southern and Eastern Europe. Speaking at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Czech Prime Minister Babiš denounced the European Green Deal, saying that the European Union "can achieve nothing without the participation of the largest polluters such as China or the USA that are responsible for 27 and 15 percent, respectively, of global  emissions."

Controversies

Initial European Green Deal
It has been found that American oil company ExxonMobil had a significant impact on the early negotiations of the European Green Deal. ExxonMobil attempted to change the deal in a way that puts less emphasis on the importance of reducing transport that emits carbon dioxide. This was only one of many opponents of the deal.

The European Green Deal has faced criticism from some EU member states, as well as non-governmental organizations. Greenpeace has argued that the deal is not drastic enough and that it will fail to slow down climate change to an acceptable degree. The Corporate Europe Observatory calls the Deal a positive first step, but criticizes the influence the fossil fuel industry had on it.

There has been criticism of the deal not doing enough, but also of the deal potentially being destructive to the European Union in its current state. Former Romanian president, Traian Băsescu, has warned that the deal could lead to some EU members to push towards an exit from the union. While some European states are on their way to eliminating the use of coal as a source of energy, many others still rely heavily on it. This scenario demonstrates how the deal may appeal to some states more than others. The economic impact of the deal is likely to be unevenly spread among EU states. This was highlighted by Polish MEP, Ryszard Legutko, who asked, “is the Commission trying to seize power from the member states?”. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, three states that depend mostly on coal for energy, were the most opposed to the deal. Young climate activist Greta Thunberg commented on governments opposing the deal, saying "It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition".

In addition, many groups such as “Greenpeace”, “Friends of the Earth Europe” and the “Institute for European Environmental Policy” have all analysed the policy and believe it isn't “ambitious enough.” Greenpeace believes the plan is “too little too late” whilst the IEEP stated that most prospects of meeting policy objectives “lacked clear or adequate” goals for the problem areas.

The Greens-European Free Alliance and Jytte Guteland have proposed that the European Green Deal's EU 2030 climate target were to be raised to at least 65% greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

The EU has acknowledged these issues, however, and through the “Just Transition Mechanism”, expects to distribute the burden of transitioning to a greener economy more fairly. This policy means that countries that have more workers in coal and oil shale sectors, as well as those with higher greenhouse emissions, will receive more financial aid. According to Frans Timmermans, this mechanism will also make investment more accessible for those most affected, as well as offering a support package, which will be worth “at least 100 billion euros”. The Mechanism, a part of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, is expected to mobilize €100 billion in investments during the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), with funding from the EU budget and Member States, as well as contributions from InvestEU and the European Investment Bank.

The Just Transition Mechanism provides a comprehensive set of support options for the most vulnerable regions. The Just Transition Fund, the first pillar, will provide €17.5 billion in EU grants available to the most affected territories, implying a national co-financing requirement of around €10 billion. The second pillar creates a specialized transition plan under InvestEU to leverage private investment. Finally, a new public sector credit facility is formed under the third pillar to leverage public finance. These measures will be accompanied by specialized advisory and technical assistance for the affected regions and projects.

The European Investment Bank Group will be able to support this through Structural Programme Loans in conjunction with European structural and investment funds (ESIF) co-financing operations.

At COP26, the European Investment Bank announced a set of just transition common principles agreed upon with multilateral development banks, which also align with the Paris Agreement. The principles refer to focusing financing on the transition to net zero carbon economies, while keeping socioeconomic effects in mind, along with policy engagement and plans for inclusion and gender equality, all aiming to deliver long-term economic transformation. Until 2030, the European Investment Bank announced that it is prepared to mobilise $1 trillion for climate action.

The African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Council of Europe Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, New Development Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank are among the multilateral development banks that have vowed to uphold the principles of climate change mitigation and a Just Transition. The World Bank Group also contributed.

Fossil fuels

The current proposals have been criticised for falling short of the goal of ending fossil fuels, or being sufficient for a green recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Environmental Bureau as well as the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that fossil fuel subsidies would need to end. However, it should be stated that this can not be done until 2021, when the Energy Taxation Directive is to be revised. Also, while fossil fuels are still actively being subsidized by the EU until 2021, even during an economic recession, it is also already working on supporting electrification of vehicles and green fuels such as hydrogen.

2021 global energy crisis

Due to a combination of unfavourable conditions, which involved soaring demand of natural gas, its diminished supply from Russia and Norway to the European markets, less power generation by renewable energy sources such as wind, water and solar energy, and cold winter that left European and Russian gas reservoirs depleted, Europe faced steep increases in gas prices in 2021. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán blamed a record-breaking surge in energy prices on the European Commission's Green Deal plans. Politico reported that "Despite the impact of high energy prices, [EU Commissioner for Energy] Simson insisted that there are no plans to backtrack on the bloc's Green Deal". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that "Europe today is too reliant on gas and too dependent on gas imports. The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy."

Academic analysis

A meta-analysis from 2023 reported results about "required technology-level investment shifts for climate-relevant infrastructure until 2035" within the EU, and found these are "most drastic for power plants, electricity grids and rail infrastructure", ~87€ billion above the planned budgets in the near-term (2021–25), and in need of sustainable finance policies.

New European Bauhaus 
The New European Bauhaus is an artistic movement initiated by the European Commission, more precisely by the President of the European Commission, Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen herself. Its aim is to implement the European Green Deal through culture by integrating esthetics, sustainability and inclusiveness.

The New European Bauhaus (NEB) is an interdisciplinary movement which intends to re-express the fundamental ambitions of the historical Bauhaus movement generated by the German architect Walter Gropius, in order to deal with contemporary issues from the fields of creation: art, crafts, design, architecture and urban planning.

The New European Bauhaus being "new" it is currently still being developed by a multicultural and international Research Committee headed by an artist, Alexandre Dang.

However the name who has been chosen is strongly criticized in some artistic communities as being "inherently not inclusive".

Phases 
This movement wanting to be as open and accessible as possible, this will be facilitated by a planification in three phases: the Design phase (2020-2021), the Delivery phase (2021-2023+) and the Dissemination phase (2023-2024+).

The Design phase 
As a first step, the Design phase was about finding methods that could boost existing ideas related to the NEB's challenges, regarding culture and technology. These two notions are considered by the New European Bauhaus as determinant elements to face contemporary concerns, especially in architecture and urban planning sectors. By launching a call for proposals, acceleration services and financial contribution started to be provided to some projects under European Union funding programs, such as Horizon Europe or LIFE programme, but also international organisations.

In the idea of a collective design dynamic, a "High-level roundtable" has been set up with 18 thinkers and practitioners, involving for example famous architects Shigeru Ban and Bjark Ingels, the President of the Italian National Innovation Fund Francesca Bria, the activist and academic Sheela Patel, and others.

The Delivery phase 
After the Design phase, the Communication of the European Commission "New European Bauhaus Beautiful, Sustainable, Together" was released on 15 September 2021. The detailed content of this communication directly led to the Delivery phase, which began by setting up five pilots projects. These projects were selected as flagship proposals for the NEB's announced goal: "a sustainable green transformation in housing, architecture, transportation, urban, and rural spaces as part of its effort to reach carbon neutrality by 2050". In fact, one of the fundamental points of the New European Bauhaus, that is put forward by the European Commission, is to translate the European Green Deal, officially approved in 2020, to make it a tangible cultural experience in which citizens from all around the world could participate.

Referring to the major principles of the original Bauhaus movement, the NEB initiative wants to be multi-level: "from global to local, participatory and transdisciplinary". By initiating a co-design process, views and experiences of thousands of citizens, professionals and organisations across the EU, and beyond, were involved into open conversations. Emerging from this collective thinking, the three terms highlighted to define the movement are "Sustainability" (including climate goals, circularity, zero pollution and biodiversity), "Aesthetics" (quality of experience and style, beyond functionality) and "Inclusion" (including diversity first, securing accessibility and affordability). The four thematic axes chosen to guide the NEB's implementation for the next years are "Reconnecting with nature", "Regaining a sens of belonging", "Prioritising the places and people that need it most", and "Fostering long term, life cycle thinking in the industrial ecosystem". The three levels of interconnected transformations expected from the initiative are "changes in places around us", "changes in the environment that enable innovation" and "changes in the diffusion of new meanings".

The Dissemination phase 
During the Dissemination phase, the New European Bauhaus planned to focus on spreading chosen ideas and concepts to a broader audience, not only inside the EU. Within the three-phases development, this last step should be about networking and sharing knowledge between practitioners on available methods, solutions and prototypes, but also, it is meant to help creators to replicate their experiences across cities, rural areas and localities and to influence the new generation of architects and designers.

New European Bauhaus prizes 
In spring 2021, the European Commission launched New European Bauhaus prizes to reward inspiring examples of the realizations fitting the NEB principles. For the first edition of the contest, Commissioners Ferreira and Gabriel awarded 20 projects in a ceremony in Brussels on 16 September 2021.  A second edition of NEB prizes is taking place in 2022.

The NEB LAB 
The NEB LAB, or New European Bauhaus Laboratory, has been established as a meeting space to work with the New European Bauhaus growing community, which is more than 450 official partners, High-Level Roundtable members, Contact Points of the national governments, and winners and finalists of the New European Bauhaus prizes. The NEB LAB's main objective is to put the movement's thinking into practice, by co-creating and testing solutions and policy actions, like the development of labeling tools. It has started with a "Call for Friends of the New European Bauhaus", in order to get public entities, companies and political organisations involved.

The New European Bauhaus Festival 
The opening of a New European Bauhaus Festival has been announced by the European Commission to allow visibility for creators, to encourage them to "showcase" their ideas and share their progress, but also to enable networking and to foster citizen engagement. It will stand on three pillars: Fair (presentation of completed projects or products), Fest (the cultural section, with artists and performance) and Forum (debates with innovative participatory formats).

Its first edition will take place on 9–12 June 2022 in Brussels. Based on this experience, the commission will draw up a concept for a yearly event that will include places in and outside the EU from 2023 onwards.

Indian Ridge is a  mountain located in Jasper National Park, in the Trident Range of the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada. The summit is unofficially called Indian Peak. The town of Jasper is situated  to the north-northeast, The Whistlers lies  to the northeast, and Muhigan Mountain is  to the west-northwest. The nearest higher peak is Manx Peak,  to the southwest, and Terminal Mountain lies  to the south. The Marmot Basin alpine ski area on Marmot Mountain is located  to the southeast. The peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to the Jurassic periods and pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

History
The peak was named in 1916 by Morrison P. Bridgland because of its reddish colored rock. Bridgland (1878–1948), was a Dominion Land Surveyor who named many peaks in Jasper Park and the Canadian Rockies. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1951 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.

Climate
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Indian Ridge is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below  with wind chill factors below . Precipitation runoff from Indian Ridge drains into tributaries of the Miette River and Athabasca River.

The Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG) is a research institution in Berlin. Its stated mission is to research “the development of the internet from a societal perspective with the aim of better understanding the accompanying digitalisation of all areas of life.”

The institute was founded by its shareholders – Humboldt Universität zu Berlin (HU), the Berlin University of the Arts (UdK) and the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB) – with the Hans Bredow Institute (HBI) for Media Research in Hamburg as an integrated cooperation partner. The research directorate is made up of Jeanette Hofmann, Björn Scheuermann, Wolfgang Schulz and Thomas Schildhauer.

HIIG, along with the Oxford Internet Institute, the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society and other institutes, founded the Global Network of Internet & Society Research Centers (NoC). The HIIG also initiated the European Hub of the NoC.

Founding initiative 
The founding institutions and sponsors include Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, the Berlin University of the Arts and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. In cooperation with the Hans Bredow Institute for Media Research in Hamburg, which serves as the fourth cooperation partner, the research institute aims to bring together leading academics and stakeholders from all walks of life to research questions about the internet. HIIG’s focus is on the topics of innovation and regulation as well as on the specialised fields of information law, media law and constitutional law. It was founded with the aim of better understanding the changes in society brought about by the internet.

The four founding directors are Ingolf Pernice (Humboldt-Universität), Thomas Schildhauer (Berlin University of the Arts) and Jeanette Hofmann (WZB) as well as Wolfgang Schulz (Hans Bredow Institute). Start-up funding of 4.5 million euros over a period of three years was provided by Google Inc. The institute’s scientific independence has been safeguarded through its special construction as a research entity and foundation. The research is carried out by the research entity.

The goals and content of the research are decided by an independent research company with oversight provided by the Scientific Advisory Board. The work of the institute began in October 2011.While the institute’s work began in 2011, it did not acquire legal form until 2012 . Since then, the Internet and Society Foundation has become a shareholder of HIIG.

Research programmes and research questions 
According to its own statements, HIIG's research work aims to deepen research in the field of internet and society, both theoretically and empirically, and thus contribute to a better understanding of digital society. The research programme is particularly concerned with the far-reaching social changes brought about by digitalisation in the area of governance and innovation. Three central research programmes guide HIIG's medium-term research activities. The focus here is on the following central research programmes and questions:  

 Research programme 1: The Evolving Digital Society: Which relevant concepts and theoretical approaches are discussed publicly as well as within the scientific community?
 Research programme 2: Data, Actors, Infrastructures: What are the key factors influencing the changes in their relationships to each other?
 Research programme 3: Knowledge & Society: Can new patterns of research and knowledge transfer be observed in the digital age?
The institute's programme-oriented research is flanked by research groups and research projects. The research groups include the AI & Society Lab, the Innovation, Entrepreneurship & Society research area, and the Global Constitutionalism and the Internet group.

Together with the Berkman Klein Center, the Digital Asia Hub and the Leibniz Institute for Media Research | Hans Bredow Institute, the institute runs the “Ethics of Digitalisation” research project under the patronage of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. It is funded by the Mercator Foundation.

In 2020, the Institute launched the Digital Urban Center for Ageing & Health (DUCAH) together with the Einstein Center Digital Future and the Internet and Society Foundation. The project aims to research healthcare and digitalisation in the field. To this end, it aims to create a forum where civil society, academia, public administration and politics can engage in exchange.

HIIG served as the as scientific office of the Third Engagement Report. The publication was handed over to the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) in January 2020 and to the German Bundestag in May of the same year.

Funding 
The founding of the institute was made possible by a grant from Google. Other sponsors and supporters include the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, the German Research Foundation, the Mercator Foundation, Commerzbank Foundation and H2020.

HIIG is under the scientific management of four directors. Postdoctoral fellows, doctoral students, associates, visiting scholars and research assistants conduct research at the institute. Since the founding of HIIG, the executive management has been under the responsibility of Karina Preiß, a media economist.

Events and knowledge transfer 

HIIG develops formats for exchange between science, politics, business and civil society. According to its own description, in addition to its approach of interdisciplinarity, it also follows a philosophy of open science: it approaches stakeholders from politics and civil society with the results of its research. In addition to events and workshops, HIIG offers a platform for knowledge transfer through the Digital Society Blog and multimedia formats such as the Exploring Digital Spheres podcast.

Since 2012, the Digitaler Salon event series has been held once a month at the institute and is also broadcast via livestream. Here, experts from a wide range of fields discuss the effects of digitalisation on our society. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the events have only been livestreamed. In 2020, HIIG researchers also launched the essay competition twentyforty, which resulted in a freely accessible publication and an exhibition. The institute also publishes the open access journal Internet Policy Review. It also runs channels on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

In addition, HIIG organises academic conferences, e.g. the Association of Internet Researchers' AoIR 2016, workshops, talks and lecture series. In 2021, HIIG researchers were instrumental in the founding of the Platform Governance Research Network, which also saw the creation of the Platform Governance Archive – this makes major internet platforms'  privacy statements and user agreements freely accessible.

In the Making Sense of the Digital Society event series launched in 2017, HIIG, together with the German Federal Agency for Civic Education (bpb), invites European thinkers to share their thoughts on the digital society and thus come to a better understanding of comprehensive transformation processes.

Speakers in the series have included:

 Manuel Castells
 Christoph Neuberger
 Elena Esposito
 Marion Fourcade
 Stephen Graham
 Nick Couldry
 Andreas Reckwitz
 Eva Illouz
 Dirk Baecker
 José van Dijck

Pavlos Kyrou was a Slavophone Greek revolutionary who participated in the Ilinden Uprising with the IMRO and the Greek Struggle for Macedonia.

Early life 
Kyrou was born in the 1860s in Zelovo (renamed Antartiko in 1927) of Florina. He was the grandson of the well known klepht Naoum Kyrou. He was able to speak both Greek and Bulgarian fluently. He graduated from the local Greek school of his hometown and began to join armed bands where in 1881, he was involved in the kidnapping of the Turkish prefect of Florina.

Macedonian Struggle 
Following a long trip to Athens, Kyrou returned to Macedonia to restart his armed activities along with Kottas, fighting with the Bulgarian Komitadjis against the Ottoman authorities. Kyrou had the capability of knowing almost all of Western Macedonia and its paths and had many cooperators and friends from all over it. As a member of the pro-Bulgarian IMRO he participated in the preparation and execution of the Ilinden uprising of 1903. Following the uprising, Kyrou and Kottas discovered the true intentions of the IMRO against the Greek population, causing their defection to the Greek side. In 1903-04 he travelled to Athens with Kottas to recruit volunteers for the struggle. He returned to cooperate with Germanos Karavangelis and Pavlos Melas.

Pavlos Melas wrote in a letter of his on 12 March 1904 about Kyrou: 

Following the arrest and execution of Kottas, he returned to Athens to organize his own armed group that would function in the Prespa region. He cooperated with other chieftains, such as Dimitrios Dalipis, Kottas, Traianos Liantzakis, Ioannis Karavitis, Nikolaos Pyrzas, and especially Efthymios Kaoudis, who would not make a single move without the approval of Kyrou.

He was killed in action along with Dalipis on 19 November 1906, during a battle against the armed groups of Mitre the Vlach and Pando Klyashev.

Legacy 
He ranks among the heroes of the Macedonian Struggle in Greece.

His son, Lazaros, also became a chieftain and continued the fight following his father's death.

There is a bust and memorial to him in his birth place of Antartiko.

In Bulgaria he is regarded as a turncoat Bulgarian, a renegade from the IMRO.

KSUN (1230 AM) was a radio station in Bisbee, Arizona. It went on the air in 1933 as one of the first radio stations in Arizona and ceased operations on January 1, 1982, though activity around the license continued for years after.

History

KSUN
The Copper Electric Company received the construction permit for a new radio station in Bisbee at 1200 kHz on June 30, 1933. That October, after changing its call letters from the original assignment of KIGY, KSUN hit the air. It was the first radio station in Bisbee and Cochise County, and by 1935, one of just eight in the whole state. The station went to unlimited time in 1935, and a power increase to 250 watts followed the next year. In 1941, NARBA moved KSUN and other stations at 1200 to the new dial position of 1230 kHz.

In 1936, an application was filed to transfer control of the Copper Electric Company from James S. Maffeo and Lawrence R. Jackson to Carleton W. Morris, who would go on to be a pioneer in Arizona broadcasting. It was not granted immediately, but in 1941, another application was. It would be the first of several radio stations for Morris. By this time, KSUN was a CBS Radio affiliate, linked to the Arizona Network, whose key station was KOY in Phoenix. It was just one of three pre-war stations in the network, which also featured KTUC in Tucson.

Originally, KSUN was nominally licensed to Lowell, Arizona. However, in 1948, the station built new facilities in Bisbee at a cost of $50,000. Morris's influence was expanding, both in and out of radio. On December 15, 1946, KAWT went on the air in Douglas, offering NBC programming; Morris built a third station, Sierra Vista's KHFH, in 1957. Morris, meanwhile, became an Arizona state representative from Bisbee, in addition to the radio stations and an electrical repair business; the 1950s also saw Morris build one of the country's first cable television systems, with 2,000 subscribers by the end of 1955, to serve a town without direct over-the-air reception of stations in Tucson or Phoenix. In 1962, Morris had bought the facilities of the shuttered Gila Broadcasting chain for $100,000 and had asked for licenses to restart the six stations whose original licenses had been revoked by the Federal Communications Commission. However, none of that came to fruition, since Morris died of a heart attack while scuba diving in Guaymas on December 3, 1962.

Morris's estate owned KSUN for several more years and sold the station in late 1965 to Bisbee Broadcasters; the application was approved in January 1966. After the death of John L. Hogg and a buyout of Jack Williams, Arlo Woolery became the sole stockholder of the company. He sold out to Howard Waterhouse in 1968. The constant ownership turnover killed off an attempt by the company to build an FM radio station, KSUN-FM, which was deleted on November 25, 1968. Waterhouse, who moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana to run the station, was approved to increase KSUN's power to 1,000 watts in 1971, though implementation had to be delayed until the Federal Communications Commission authorized KSUN and three other stations to carry out power increases in the absence of a response from Mexican authorities.

KSUN was sold again in 1976 to Sun Broadcasting, Inc. The president of Sun, James McCollum, held leadership positions at radio stations in Ashdown, Arkansas and Warrensburg, Missouri.

KBZB

Sun Broadcasting sold the station again to Sun Country Communications Corporation in 1980, a deal that would ultimately plunge the station into silence. Dogged by financial troubles, KSUN went off the air without warning on January 1, 1982, mired in a series of lawsuits over the Sun Country acquisition; later in the month, the company was placed into receivership. Desperate for money, the KSUN call letters were sold to a Phoenix radio station, which changed from KXIV to become the new KSUN in June 1982. The Bisbee station then became KBZB. The station's general manager in 1980 and part-owner, 36-year-old Tedd Coppin, died of a heart attack in December of that year.

Activity continued into the 1980s on the KBZB license, though it never broadcast. In early 1984, the station applied for the call letters KESE, during which time a sale to Copper Valley Broadcasters was being negotiated but fell through. In 1988, Sun Country—still in bankruptcy—was finally able to sell the station license to the Rex Company, owned by Marvin and Tommy King, which acquired KBZB for $2,000; the purchase price, however, didn't reflect the reality of what they were buying, as Marvin King told Radio & Records that the facilities were in such disrepair that a $150,000 investment would be required in a construction permit and new equipment. The station never did return to air; it was listed as silent in 1991 and had its 1990 license renewal application dismissed in 1993 because of the station's silence.

Howard Mason Gore (1877–1947), 17th Governor of West Virginia
Robert Hayes Gore (1886–1972), Governor of Puerto Rico from 1933 to 1934William Fawcett was the name given to two paddle steamers that operated in British waters from the late 1820s to the mid-1840s. The first ship, constructed in 1828, is widely regarded as the inaugural vessel in the service of what eventually evolved into the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O).

1828 ship 
In 1828, William Fawcett of Liverpool and Joseph Robinson Pim of Dublin commissioned the construction of a paddle steamer named William Fawcett. The ship was built by Caleb and James Smith at the Queen's Dock, Port of Liverpool. Initially, the vessel measured 130 feet (40 m) in length and had a cargo capacity of 185 tons. However, in 1835, its length was recorded as 44.42 meters (145.7 ft), with a gross register tonnage of 206. The steam engines, rated at 130 horsepower, were provided by the firm of Fawcett, Preston, and Company, of which William Fawcett was a co-owner and manager. The ship operated in the packet trade, serving the routes between London, Cork and Dublin. In 1832, the vessel was sold to Richard Bourne and his associates for service with the Dublin and London Steam Packet Company.

In 1835, Bourne partnered with Brodie McGhie Willcox and Arthur Anderson to charter the William Fawcett for five voyages between London and the Iberian Peninsula. This service is regarded as the beginning of the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, which later became the P&O. The first four trips of the William Fawcett for the Peninsular company in 1835 turned around at Lisbon. The fifth trip reached Gibraltar. In 1837 and again in early 1838, the ship was chartered by the Peninsular company for a trip from London to northern Spain and return. The ship was refitted later in 1838, and afterwards chartered by the Peninsular company for two trips between London and Madeira. The William Fawcett had been broken up by April 1845.

1829 ship 
The second William Fawcett was a paddle steamer built in 1829 in Liverpool by Mottershead and Hayes. It was  long, with a capacity of 48 tons. It had a 26 (or 30) horsepower engine supplied by Fawcett, Preston and Company. The ship worked as a ferry between Liverpool and Birkenhead for at least twenty years.

It is a part of the Yantarny Sports Complex, which contains 10 sports halls, and 2 indoor arenas. The two indoor arenas consist of the Yantarny Sports Complex Small Arena, which has a seating capacity of 1,000 people, and Amber Arena, which has a seating capacity of 7,000 people. Amber Arena can be used to host numerous different events, such as: exhibitions, concerts, gymnastics, volleyball, martial arts tournaments, futsal, handball, and basketball.

History
Amber Arena opened in 2009. The Lokomotiv Kaliningrad Region Women's Volleyball Club has used the facility as its home arena. The arena has also been used as a home venue by both the senior Russian men's national volleyball team and the senior Russian women's national volleyball team, and it also hosted several major FIVB international volleyball tournaments. During the 2019–20 season, the arena was used as a substituent home arena of the VTB United League club CSKA Moscow, for two EuroLeague games.
Jack Rayner (born 19 December 1995) is an Australian long-distance runner. He qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan. He ran in the men's marathon but failed to finish due to cramping in both his legs after running 500 meters.

Rayner is part of the Melbourne Track Club.

Early years 
When Rayner was about 7 years of age his parents looked for a sport for him. A neighbour suggested he would make a good cross country runner. By the age of 9 he had a coach, Keith Fearnley. A year later he ran at his first national cross country championships. For the next ten years he continued to run nationally mostly finishing just outside the medals. However, when he was 17 years of age he won the national junior 5000m.

After school, Rayner was unsure what to do with his life and worked in landscaping for a few years. He still ran long distances and competed in fun runs. He then decided to take his running seriously and joined Nic Bideau's Melbourne Track Club.

Achievements 
In 2015 he won the Australian national championships in the 3000m. In 2018 he won the half marathon national championships in the Sunshine Coast. Later on in 2018, Jack won the inaugural half marathon Commonwealth championships in Cardiff in a time of 1:01:01.

In October 2019 he was one of forty-one pacemakers in the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, where Eliud Kipchoge successfully became the first person to run the marathon distance in under 2 hours.

In April 2019, Rayner made his marathon debut in London and clocked a Tokyo Olympic qualifier of 2:11.06, a time which has held up for selection for the postponed Games in 2021.

On 6 March 2022 Rayner set a new Australian record in the 10,000m with a time of 27:15.22.

Giba is a river of northern Ethiopia. It starts at the confluence of Genfel and Sulluh (which rises in the mountains of Mugulat) (3298 metres above sea level) and flows westward to the Tekezé River. Future Lake Giba will occupy the plain where Sulluh, Genfel and Agula'i Rivers meet, and hence be the future source of Giba River.

Hydrography 
It is a confined river, locally meandering in its narrow alluvial plain, with a slope gradient of 7 metres per kilometre. With its tributaries, the river has cut a deep gorge.

Tributaries
Main tributaries, from downstream to upstream, are
 Tanqwa
 Tsech'i River
 May Qoqah
 Arwadito
 Adawro River
 May Selelo
 Zikuli River
 Gra Adiam River, also called Bitchoqo River
 Zeyi River

Hydrology

Hydrological characteristics
The runoff footprint or annual total runoff volume is 558 million m³.
Peak discharges up to 1740 m³ per second occur in the second part of the rainy season (month of August) when there are strong rains and the soils are saturated with water in many places.
The percentage of total rainfall that directly leaves the catchment as storm runoff (also called runoff coefficient) is 8%.

The total amount of sediment that is transported by this river amounts to 3.96 million tonnes per year. Median sediment concentration in the river water is 10 grammes per litre, but may go up to 42 g/L. The highest sediment concentrations occur at the beginning of the rainy season, when loose soil and dust is washed away by overland flow and ends up in the river.
As such water contains many nutrients (locally it is called “aygi”), farmers estimate that it strengthens their cattle, which they will bring to the river. All in all, average sediment yield is 1065 tonnes per km² and per year. All measurements were done at a purposively installed stations, on Giba and Tanqwa rivers, just upstream of their junction, in the years 2006 and 2007.

Flash floods
Runoff mostly occurs in the form of high runoff discharge events that occur in a very short period (called flash floods). These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding baseflow. These flash floods mostly occur during the evening or night, because the convective rain showers occur in the afternoon.

Changes over time

Evidence given by  Italian aerial photographs of the catchment, taken in the 1930s show that 49% of the catchment was covered with woody vegetation (against 35% in 2014). This vegetation could slow down runoff and the runoff coefficient was smaller (5% in 1935 against 8% in 2014). As a consequence, discharges in the river were less and the river was narrower than today.
Up to the 1980s, there was strong pressure on the environment, and much vegetation disappeared. This river had its greatest discharges and width in that period.

The magnitude of floods in this river has however been decreased in recent years due to interventions in the catchment. At Gemgema,   Afedena, May Be'ati and on many other steep slopes, exclosures have been established; the dense vegetation largely contributes to enhanced infiltration, less flooding and better baseflow. Physical conservation structures such as stone bunds and check dams also intercept runoff.

Irrigated agriculture
Besides springs and reservoirs, irrigation is strongly dependent on the river’s baseflow. Such irrigated agriculture is important in meeting the demands for food security and poverty reduction. Irrigated lands are established in the narrow alluvial plains all along the river, mostly using pump irrigation. Very often tropical fruits are grown in these gorges as the climate is warmer than the overall surrounding highlands.

Transhumance towards the river gorge
The valley bottoms in the gorge of this river, for instance at Inda Mihtsun, have been identified as a transhumance destination zone.
Transhumance takes place in the summer rainy season, when the lands near the villages are occupied by crops. Young shepherds will take the village cattle down to the gorge and overnight in small caves. The gorges are particularly attractive as a transhumance destination zone, because there is water and good growth of semi-natural vegetation.

Boulders and pebbles in the river bed

Boulders and pebbles encountered in the river bed can originate from any location higher up in the catchment. In the uppermost stretches of the river, only rock fragments of the upper lithological units will be present in the river bed, whereas more downstream one may find a more comprehensive mix of all lithologies crossed by the river. From upstream to downstream, the following lithological units occur in the catchment.
 Phonolite plugs
 Upper basalt
 Interbedded lacustrine deposits
 Lower basalt
 Amba Aradam Formation
 Antalo Limestone
 Adigrat Sandstone
 Edaga Arbi Glacials
 Quaternary alluvium and freshwater tufa
Logically, in the uppermost stretches of the river, only the pebbles and boulders of the upper lithological units will be present in the river bed, whereas more downstream one may find a more comprehensive mix of all lithologies crossed by the river.

Natural boundary
During its course, this river three different district (“woreda”) borders. On the various parts:
 Upper Giba: border between Dogu’a Tembien and  Inderta
 Middle Giba: border between Dogu’a Tembien and Saharti Samre
 Lower Giba: border between Kola Tembien and Abergele (woreda)

Trekking along the river
Trekking routes have been established across and along this river. The tracks are not marked on the ground but can be followed using downloaded .GPX files.
 Trek 15, along the middle course of Giba
 Trek 22, across the Giba gorge  in Debre Nazret
 Trek G, across the Giba gorge  in Amanit
 Treks S1 and S2, across the Giba gorge  in Abergele (woreda)
In the rainy season, flash floods may occur and it is advised not to follow the river bed. Frequently, it is then also impossible to wade across the river.
The second season of The House of Flowers, a Mexican black comedy-drama television series about the privileged de la Mora family and their titular floristry shop, was released to Netflix in its entirety on October 18, 2019. The character Paulina de la Mora, played by Cecilia Suárez, becomes the main character. The season picks up a year after the end of the first season, and starts with Paulina learning of a challenge to her now-deceased mother Virginia's will and moving back to Mexico from Madrid. Paulina becomes overwhelmed trying to helm her family with different adversities along the way, while being mainly driven by revenge and unhappiness. The season had four directors, with the majority of episodes directed by show creator Manolo Caro, and written by Caro, Mara Vargas, Gabriel Nuncio, Hipatia Argüero Mendoza, and Alexandro Aldrete.

Filming began in Spain in February 2019, with the second and third seasons being produced together. Critical response to the season was not as good as the first season, but it still had various nominations at the Spanish Actors Union Awards and Platino Awards.

Synopsis
Eight months before the outset of season 2, shortly after the events of season 1, Virginia dies. After her funeral, the children part ways – Paulina moves to Madrid to be with her ex-spouse, now-girlfriend María José; Elena becomes a successful architect; and Micaéla and Julián live at home. Ernesto, overcome by grief, joins a Scientology-esque scam cult. A challenge to Virginia's long-awaited will brings the siblings back together, Paulina returning from Spain to take care of business.

Paulina decides that she must honor her mother, support her siblings, and get revenge on Diego; to do all three, she has to re-purchase the florists from the Chiquis. She re-opens the cabaret, which Diego – reappearing in the family's life because he has been trying to reconnect with Julián – fronts the money for, so he can win back the de la Mora's family trust. Julián has had a child with his ex, Lucía, but Diego pays these bills, too. Paulina makes a sketchy deal with Julián's escort agency for the cabaret, but pins the deal to Diego in case it goes awry. She also meets a mysterious Catalan man called Alejo, who says he was a friend to her mother while both were receiving cancer treatment; though she tries to be suspicious, she ends up getting closer to him.

Meanwhile, Julián tries to find a proper job and reignites his relationship with Diego, but also works a rentboy hustle in secret. Ernesto rises the ranks in his cult, who impede on the family's life after their leader relocates her followers to their home. Micaéla, feeling alone with minimal parental guidance, has taken up magic tricks and enters the TV competition Talento México, taking Bruno as her guardian. When she gets through the rounds, Bruno asks his friend Moisés to join them and transform her into a singer; Bruno has also become enamored with a pretty teenage contestant.

Elena is trying to manage her position as a senior architect while being increasingly distracted by men, and realizes she has a relationship addiction. She begins attending a sex addicts' group therapy at a hair salon but starts a sexual relationship with someone there until discovering he is a priest. María José, after traveling to Mexico, finds happiness supporting the trans women and drag queens at the cabaret, who Paulina has been ignoring to work on her schemes. Their relationship fractures, and María José breaks up with Paulina and returns to Spain, being hounded by her overbearing sister. Paulina tries to call María José as she accepts Diego's innocence and loyalty to her family, handing herself in to the police for the soliciting at the cabaret.

Production

Development
In August 2018, Castro announced that she would not reprise the role of Virginia for potential future seasons because she felt that her "character's journey is over." Caro confirmed a week later that Castro would no longer appear in the show, which would focus on the de la Mora children if another season was produced. Castro revealed in 2019 that, though the decision for her to leave was friendly and mutual between all parties, Caro and Netflix had originally asked to renew her contract for the second season to appear in only the first few episodes and then provide voice-overs; Castro would not agree to this, saying that she has always been all or nothing. As the writers had not developed a full storyline for her character, they all agreed there was not much left for her to do, a story confirmed by Caro. However, in 2020, Castro said that she had been finalizing her appearances in the second season with Netflix but Caro changed his mind on what he wanted, resulting in her being removed from the show. In August 2019, as the second season began releasing promotional materials, Castro confirmed that her likeness was used in the upcoming season, but that she hadn't been paid for the appearances because she had not done any additional work for it. In the second season, without Castro as the lead, reviewers saw that fan favorite Paulina became the central character; Rodrigo Munizaga speculated that Castro, without a continuing contract, was even less enthused to return after she had been "overshadowed" by Suárez in season one. Going into the show's sophomore season, Vogue described Suárez as "the new queen of the telenovela".

Caro explained that the writing and production of the second season did not change very much, despite Castro's absence, because they "knew from the beginning that there was a possibility she would not return", saying that they had already outlined the stories for the children independent of this. During production, Caro said that the second season would be more "intense", and that exploring how the family works without the matriarch's presence is an important topic, with Suárez adding that it would be crazier than the first season. The use of music also became a more physical presence in the second season, with Caro explaining: "It was an evolution, in the first season and without realizing it, these playlists were created and really grabbed my attention regardless of what songs they had, they asked me what songs I listened to when I was writing, and it helped us to be creative in the writers' room."

In 2019, some of the production moved to Netflix's new Madrid headquarters, with development split between Spain and Mexico.

Casting

Paco León's sister María León was added to the cast for season 2, to play Purificación Riquelme, the sister of María José. The casting was praised by Spanish media for using the real sister of María José's actor, suggesting that beyond looking alike, the siblings have very noticeable light-colored eyes and it would not have made sense to cast somebody else when María León is also an accomplished actor.

Casting for season 2 was announced as it began filming, first on February 5 with Spanish cast members María León, Eduardo Rosa as Alejo, and Eduardo Casanova as Edu, and then with Mexican actors on February 18: Loreto Peralta as Rosita, Flavio Medina as Simón, Anabel Ferreira as Celeste, and Mariana Treviño as Jenny Quetzal. Eduardo Rosa said of his casting that he submitted a video audition and was invited to Madrid to meet with Caro before he had read the script, but told Caro that he loved it anyway. David Chaviras also returned as El Cacas in season 2. His character only had a small part and was not intended to return, but became popular among fans because of his charismatic interaction with Paulina; Cacas gained a larger role in the second season, as well as a meeting room named after him in Netflix's Mexico headquarters.

Having worked with Caro and Suárez before, Teresa Ruiz says that the character of Marilú was developed for her to have a role in the show. In a 2019 interview, Ruiz says she asked Caro for something easier when he proposed the escort because she had not done comedy before, but was swayed by Caro's determination. Ruiz also says that a lot of thought was put into the message of the character, and that even though the show is comedic, when she gives speeches about the rights of the young escorts it is intended to be truthful dialogue about all working women.

Filming

Filming began in early February 2019, with production in Spain from February 5, and ended on July 9, 2019. Some of the season was filmed on location in Madrid in February 2019; Carmen Maura visited the set to discuss the upcoming Netflix show, Someone Has To Die, that she was working on with Caro and Suárez. Caro said that during the development of the season, he had wanted to film in Spain, but wasn't sure he could make it happen, saying that he wanted to give back to the public there that supported the series; Caro had promised fans that Paulina would walk down Madrid's Gran Vía in season 2, and revealed to the Spanish press shortly before the season was released that this would definitely be included. Filming in Mexico largely took place in a nineteenth-century house in Condesa, and the second and third seasons were filmed at the same time.

Release and marketing

The second season premiered in its entirety on October 18, 2019. In its first week of broadcast, the second season was watched by over 6.2 million accounts, from across the world; it became the top viewed show on Netflix that week in Argentina, Colombia, Spain, and Mexico, among other countries. It also broke the Netflix record in Mexico as the most-viewed second season of any show in its first week ever.

The first marketing videos were released in August 2019 and used the "characteristic cadence" of Paulina's voice. On August 8, a video of Paulina leaving a threatening voicemail for Diego, mimicking the one in Taken, was released. On August 12, it was announced that the character of Virginia had died rather than simply been written out, in a marketing video showing a voice note left in the siblings' WhatsApp chat by Paulina along with the hashtag "#QDEPVirginiaDeLaMora" ("RIP Virginia de la Mora"), and on August 15, 2019, the release date of the season was included in a tweet that also showed the new family portrait. On October 2, another marketing video, also focused on Paulina speaking, was released. In it, Netflix asks the character to make an ASMR video recap, which she attempts. The first official trailer was released on September 23, showing scenes from the first episode in both Madrid and Mexico City, focusing on Paulina trying to regain the florists and find Diego.

A press tour was held for season 2 a few weeks before it was released; Aislinn Derbez did not participate, despite being a main character, because the release date of the season was the same as her family's new reality show on competing streaming platform Amazon Prime Video.

Episodes

Critical reception

The new character Jenny Quetzal was described as "unnecessary" by Ángel Balán, and Kike Esparza agreed that she "contributed nothing"; however, Balán thought that the final episode was one of the best season finales that he had seen in a long time. Espinof's review said that it was "full of humor, a slight touch of social criticism and, of course, lots of little twists" but, like the first season, it fell flat in some areas. Cinemagavia's Diego Da Costa wrote that the plots lost originality and the scripts lost their humor, adding that the "new characters do not combine well with the universe" of the series. Reviewer Alberto Carlos said that some of the plots are gratuitous, with the cult story-line being like "overstretched chewing gum". Carlos concluded that Caro may have sacrificed good writing for the sake of eccentricity, with Esparza similarly suggesting that humorous plots were used without having any substance. Gisela Orozco of the Chicago Tribune thought that it seemed like Caro was improvising and coming up with new plots on the spur of the moment, that he was "adding 'water' to his flowers [but they] did not 'bloom' at all".

Javier Zurro described the season's main vice as being that it seems to have "taken itself seriously", which does not work with the format, and has turned back into the telenovelas that the first season was parodying. He noted that the concepts of the season do not feel fresh, because it has copied all the formulas of the first; he did, however, believe that the first season was surprisingly good and so the second had the challenge "to be bigger, more spectacular". Munizaga instead suggested that the main issue is that it does not include much of what made the first season so fresh, calling it "meek and decaffeinated" in comparison.

Zurro was also critical of the choice to kill off Virginia in the face of Verónica Castro's absence, seeing it as an easy way out. Esparza thought that the season would have been better if it had retained Verónica Castro as Virginia, because the show's dynamic is not the same without Virginia and Paulina playing off each other; Munizaga wrote that the season feels uncentered, and this is likely because without Castro's Virginia there is no reason to focus on the titular shop, making its inclusion forced. However, Marieta Taibo for Cosmopolitan wrote that her departure is handled well and that Suárez and Paulina become the center, and CNET's Patricia Puentes said that "it is hard to miss" the character and the actress, both because of Suárez's performance and because Virginia is still referenced throughout the season.

Despite the more negative response, reviewers looked positively on the character of Paulina. Carlos wrote that "the show is saved by the character of Paulina", with Esparza opining that except for Paulina, María José and Delia the character performances are more like caricatures of who they were in season one. Zurro concluded, in contrast to his dismal outlook on the season, that "of course, Paulina de la Mora is still there, and she and Cecilia Suárez are still the rulers of the series", expecting the third season to be better. However, Munizaga commented that Paulina's motivations in the season are "absurd" – Zurro had claimed this of the other characters – but does say that the subplots of everyone else are worse, being both unbelievable and uninteresting. Da Costa reflected that "Suárez is the backbone of the cast, and although she gave the best performance of the series, she is missing some of Paulina's spirit"; he added that Medina and Paco León had been under-utilized, writing that Medina "is a triumph in the scenes in which he does appear" and that León was "very wasted".

Commenting on the art and aesthetics of the season, Da Costa wrote that the "sparkle, mamarrachería" ("craziness") and "visual histrionics" were missing compared to the first season. He also added that the symbolism of the florists was forgotten, only appearing at a narrative level rather than truly expressed, and that the attempts at "Spanishizing" were unsuccessful, rendering the season "more like a tribute to Mecano than a musical-visual composition". However, he did compliment the comic timing of the editing.

Accolades

The second season received several nominations at 2020 ceremonies. For the , both León siblings were nominated, but neither won. For the 2020 Platino Awards, the show received the third-most television acting nominations (three), including two in the new Supporting categories, for Suárez as best actress, Treviño as best supporting actress, and Medina as supporting actor. The only win was for Suárez, repeating her win from the 2019 awards.

Aggregate results
Helen Lathrop Gilbert Ecob (c.1850 – December 27, 1934) was an American writer and suffragist. Ecob was well known for her 1892 book on women's fashion reform, The Well-Dressed Woman: A Study in the Practical Application to Dress of the Laws of Health, Art, and Morals. She was involved in dress reform and women's suffrage throughout her life.

Biography 
Ecob was born in Gilbertsville, New York. She married a minister, James Henry Ecob, in the early 1870s. The Ecobs would have four children together. They moved to Albany, New York, in 1881 and then to Denver in 1893. The family moved to Philadelphia in September 1898 and then on to Flushing, New York, in 1907.

Ecob's husband died in New York on November 6, 1921. Ecob died on December 27, 1934, at her daughter's house in Suffern, New York. Their daughter Katherine G. Ecob became a noted psychologist and New York State official on mental hygiene issues.

Work 
Ecob was a well-known leader in the woman's suffrage movement, according to the Rockland County Journal News. In Denver, Ecob would see the effects of women's suffrage in Colorado. She was quoted on her opinion about suffrage for women in Colorado in The Blue Book, which was a compiled list of arguments for women's suffrage. In 1893, Ecob served on Dress Committee of the National Council of Women. Ecob was present for the final hearing on the women's suffrage amendment for the New York State Constitutional Convention in Albany, New York, and had spoken on the topic to the committees involved. In 1910, Ecob and her daughter, Frances, spoke at the Queens County Courthouse on matters relating to women's suffrage. Ecob was currently leading the Queens Equal Suffrage Movement while her daughter was the leader of the Flushing Suffragettes.

Writing 
Ecob's 1892 book, The Well-Dressed Woman: A Study in the Practical Application to Dress of the Laws of Health, Art, and Morals, was written to reform the way women dressed and to promote their health and well-being. The book was also concerned with women's health in relation to what women wear. Ecob was very firm on the idea that corsets and tight items of underclothing were unhealthy. The Well-Dressed Woman also included diagrams and illustrations of more comfortable styles of dress for women.

Ecob also wrote essays for the magazine, The Congregationalist.
This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks of 1953, primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. This was the first year to record an F5 tornado as well as one of the deadliest tornado seasons in official U.S. records, which go back to 1950.

Events

Despite not many tornadoes being documented, 1953 was an extremely deadly season and set the record for most tornadoes recorded in the U.S. in a single year at the time. The first six months of the year generated several large outbreaks and outbreak sequences that killed over 400 people. Activity abruptly slowed after that before another outbreak sequence in early December killed 49. Many of fatalities were caused by the unusually large number of violent tornadoes that were recorded that year. This included five F5 tornadoes, the first F5 tornadoes recorded in the US tornado database created in 1950. In all, there were 523 tornado-related fatalities in the US alone in 1953, the most since 1925. This high a death toll would not be repeated until 2011. There were 5,131 injuries recorded throughout the year as well. 1953 is also the only year since 1950 to have three tornadoes kill over 90 people and to have two tornadoes kill over 110. On a positive note, major changes were made to improve both the warning and radar systems. These changes were successful and since 1953, only one tornado, the 2011 Joplin tornado, has killed more than 100 people.

March
There were 40 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March.

March 12–15

The first major outbreak of the year struck areas from the Great Plains to the Ohio Valley. The worst tornado occurred on March 13, when an F4 tornado struck the towns of Jud, O'Brien, and Knox City, Texas, killing 17 and injuring 25. The same day, a destructive F3 tornado killed one and injured eight in Bradley, Oklahoma. A long-tracked F3 tornado family passed over Lake Murray State Park and struck Earl, Oklahoma, killing two and injuring 11. Several strong, destructive tornadoes touched down in Arkansas overnight into March 14 before another deadly F2 tornado killed one in Altitude, Mississippi. The outbreak ended the next day after an isolated, narrow but intense, long-track F3 tornado ripped through Northern Wilson, Macclesfield, and Crisp, North Carolina, injuring one. Overall, the outbreak produced at least 23 tornadoes, killed 21 people, and injured 72 others.

March 21–22

An outbreak of 10 tornadoes struck the Midwest and the Mississippi Valley. On March 21, an F1 tornado east of Danbury, Iowa destroyed a barn and a machine shed and damaged building on a farm. The roof of the machine shed fell on two occupants, injuring both of them. Later a large F3 tornado moved through Emmett County passing near Ringsted, striking at least two farms. It damaged or destroyed several barns, machine sheds, chicken houses, and other buildings and killed two cows and 100 chickens. There were no casualties from this tornado. In Minnesota, a brief but strong F2 tornado north of St. Cloud destroyed a launderette, storage warehouse, a lumber yard, and several garages and blew out several store fronts. A boy was killed in the launderette and three others were injured. (The CDNS report says that the three injuries actually came from another tornado that also killed one person when it struck Gibbon. That tornado is not officially counted and is, therefore, unconfirmed) The next day, a long-tracked F1 tornado tracked  through Simpson, Smith, Jasper, Newton, and Lauderdale counties in Mississippi, damaging or destroying several homes and injuring one person. Around the same time, an even longer-tracked F2 tornado traveled  through Louisiana and Mississippi (although this was more than likely a tornado family rather than just a single tornado as it was described as the jump-skip type). It first moved through Vernon, Natchitoches, Grant, Winn, Caldwell, Richland, West Carroll, and East Carroll parishes in Louisiana with the most severe damage in Columbia. Two people were killed and 22 others were injured in the state before the tornado crossed over into Washington County, Mississippi, doing additional damage before dissipating. Overall, the tornadoes killed three and injured 28.

April
There were 47 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April.

April 5 (Bermuda)

Four waterspouts moved from south to north over Bermuda in short succession, causing severe damage. About 90 properties were damaged, a few of which were deemed uninhabitable. The first of these storms passed near the Bermuda Meteorological Service, producing two wind gusts over  as well as an eight millibar drop in pressure. The third one, which was the most damaging, struck Hamilton and Harrington Sound, killing one person.  Several injuries were also confirmed from these storms.

April 9

A series of three tornadoes struck Kansas, Illinois, and Indiana. In Kansas, a brief F1 tornado touched down north-northwest of Dighton with no casualties. (the CDNS report says that this tornado was actually two tornadoes that occurred on April 29) Later, in Illinois, an F2 tornado hit the northwest side of Lincoln, striking the Logan County Fairgrounds before moving northeastward into rural areas and damaging buildings on six farms. Three people were injured. The worst tornado was a large and extremely long-tracked F3 tornado that traveled  through Illinois and Indiana and was up to . Grazulis stated that this event was a tornado family of four tornadoes. Embedded within a larger area of damaging straight-line winds and large hail, the tornado began near Leverett, Illinois in Champaign County and tracked east-northeastward through Vermilion County, causing major damage in rural areas and several small communities. Particularly hard-hit was the towns of Collison, Jamesburg, and Bismarck. Across the Illinois part of the track, eight homes were destroyed and 72 others were damaged, some field crops were damaged, and many stored crops and livestock were lost. One person was killed and 10 others were injured. The tornado was also the first tornado to be associated with a signature detected by weather radar as a hook echo was found as it passed by Champaign. After crossing into Indiana, the tornado moved at an average speed of ~ as it passed south of Attica. It moved through Warren, Tippecanoe, Clinton, Tipton, Madison, and Delaware counties before finally dissipating in Albany. It severely damaged or completely destroyed 150 buildings, threw a car  before destroying it, and cut power to both Attica and Muncie.  Two people were killed in Albany, while 12 others were injured. In all, the tornado killed three people and injured 22 others. The tornado was rated F4 by Grazulis based on the damage done north of Newtown, Indiana in Fountain County and damage in northwest Randolph County, although official records do not indicate that the tornado moved into Randolph County. In the end, the three tornadoes killed three people and injured 25 others.

April 18

Three strong and destructive tornadoes struck Alabama and Georgia. Most of casualties came from a large, long-tracked F3 tornado that traveled 39.8 miles through Alabama into Georgia. The 400 yard tornado touched down in Lochapoka, Alabama and moved southeast through Lee County damaging or destroying hundreds of homes. It then moved into Georgia and striking Bibb City on the north side of Columbus destroying 599 homes and other buildings and damaged over 2,500 others. Hundreds of
trees and utility lines were blown down, blocking streets, knocking out electric services and smashing numerous automobiles and other property. The tornado killed eight people and injured 495 others. This, as of , was the most injuries caused by an F3/EF3 tornado in the United States. Two additional F2 tornadoes also touched down in Georgia that day. The first one struck Montezuma, destroyed three homes and eight other buildings and damaging 73 other homes and 8 additional buildings, including a metal hangar that was lifted from its foundations and carried some distance across the Montezuma Airport. One person was injured and 75 families were affected. The second one struck Buena Vista, destroying 10 homes and 40 other buildings while damaging 25 other homes and 20 additional buildings. Many trees and utility lines were blown down, knocking out services and a large number of crops in storage, (mostly cotton seeds) were destroyed. Two people were injured and 50 families were affected. In the end, the tornadoes killed eight people and injured 498 others. Some of the same areas taken out by the F3 tornado were hit again by an even stronger and deadlier EF4 tornado on March 3, 2019.

April 23–24

Another destructive and deadly tornado outbreak hit Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Iowa with all the casualties occurring in Oklahoma. On April 23, an F2 tornado northeast of Weleetka, Oklahoma overturned a school bus several times, demolished several other buildings on a dairy farm and destroyed 25 telephone poles. One person was killed and four others were injured. A brief, but large,  F3 tornado moved over Alma, Arkansas, destroying multiple buildings, including a brand new brick structure, although there were no casualties. Later, another F2 tornado moved east-southeastward through Idabel, Oklahoma, damaging or destroying 11 buildings and injuring one. The worst tornado was a small, but deadly F2 tornado that moved northeastward and hit Eagletown, Oklahoma, destroying three homes, damaging six others, killing one person, and injuring 14 others. More tornado activity was confirmed the next day. An F2 tornado skipped northeastward through the college section of Texarkana, Arkansas, causing considerable damage to homes, trees, and vehicles, although there were no casualties.

The worst event occurred on April 30, when a large F4 tornado killed 18 and injured 300 in Warner Robins, Georgia. Two F4 tornadoes touched down in Alabama on May 1, causing nine deaths and 15 injuries. The outbreak ended on May 2, but not before another F4 tornado killed four and injured eight northeast of Decatur, Tennessee. Overall, the outbreak killed 36 people and injured 361.

May
There were 94 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May.

May 9–11

A violent outbreak of at least 33 tornadoes struck the Great Plains and the Upper Mississippi Valley in Early-May just a week after the previous outbreak ended. On May 9, a large, long-tracked, half mile wide F3 tornado hit Milligan, Friend, and Milford, Nebraska, killing five and injuring 82. May 10 saw three F4 tornadoes strike Iowa. The third F4 twister ended up being an extremely long-tracked tornado family that moved through Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin on a  path. It struck the towns of Chester, Iowa, Wykoff, Dover, St. Charles, Crystal Spring and Minneiska, Minnesota, and Cochrane, Waumandee, Lookout, Strum, Foster, Ludington, Edson, Stanley, Brownsville, and Gilman, Taylor County, Wisconsin. This family consisted of at least five tornadoes, killing two and injuring 24. Tornado activity on May 11 began with a .5 mile wide F4 tornado striking areas between Grape Creek and San Angelo, Texas, killing 13 and injuring 159. Later that day, the first officially rated F5 tornado in US history obliterated Downtown Waco, destroying or collapsing many of the structures and tossing numerous vehicles. 114 were killed and 597 were injured, making it the deadliest tornado in Texas history. Overall, the outbreak killed 144 and injured 895.

May 16–19

Widely scattered tornadoes struck numerous areas across the US. On May 16, an F2 tornado developed within a squall line near Church Point, Louisiana and moved northeastward through Lewisburg, parts of Opelousas, and Point Barre. It destroyed several homes and blew down warehouse walls and an oil derrick. Three people were injured. Later, an F3 tornado struck the Porter Springs Community and Wesley Chapel near Crockett, Texas, destroying 12 homes and 32 other buildings with an additional 18 homes and 6 other buildings damaged. One person was killed and eight others were injured (the CDNS report list three injuries). On May 17, a long-tracked F3 tornado moved through Rayville, Epps, and Wilman, Louisiana, injuring 17 people before it was lost after crossing into the Mississippi marshlands. On May 19, a rare F2 "freak 'twister'" struck Orland, California. Although there were no casualties, considerable damage occurred. The tornado wrecked the  shop building of the Lambert Chevrolet Plant was wrecked, lifted the roof off the Aletto Building before setting it back down on the building, and lifted and moved a chicken house while causing only minimal damage to it while also throwing milk cans from a truck nearby. Overall, the 17 tornadoes during the period killed one and injured 30.

May 20–21 (United States and Canada)

Three intense tornadoes struck Iowa, Michigan, and Ontario over the course of two days. On May 20, two long-tracked F3 tornadoes struck Iowa, killing one and injuring seven. The next day, a violent long-tracked F4 tornado struck the cities of Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario, killing seven and injuring 117. At least nine more tornadoes were reported in Ontario, but none were confirmed. Overall, the outbreak killed eight and injured 123.

May 29

An outbreak of nine tornadoes struck the Great Plains. The worst tornado was a  wide F5 tornado that struck Fort Rice, North Dakota (although some experts like Grazulis dispute this, claiming that it was an F4 tornado; Grazulis did rate the tornado F5 later on). The tornado completely leveled a church and threw car parts up to . In the end, 20 of the 22 injuries and both deaths from the outbreak came from this tornado.

June
There were 110 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June.

June 7–9

Less than one month after the deadly Waco outbreak, an even deadlier tornado outbreak sequence struck the Great Plains, Great Lakes, and even New England in early June. It started on June 7, when a tornado outbreak spawned 34 tornadoes across the Great Plains. The strongest and only fatal tornado of the day was a  wide F4 tornado that struck areas near Arcadia, Nebraska. It injured no one, but killed 11, including an entire family of 10 at a swept away farm. In Iowa, a  wide F2 tornado traveled , destroying several barns, but causing no casualties. In all, tornadoes on June 7 killed 11 and injured 19.

While June 8 had fewer tornadoes than the previous day, the nine tornadoes that hit Michigan and Ohio that day were stronger and deadlier. The first fatal tornado of the day was an F4 tornado that struck Temperance, Michigan before moving through areas south of Erie, killing four and injuring 17. The only Ohio tornado of the day then touched down and became a long-tracked F4 tornado family (which may have reached F5 intensity in Cygnet, Jerry City, or both) that struck the cities of Fremont, Sandusky, Elyria, and even Western Cleveland, causing catastrophic damage, killing 17, and injuring 379 on its  path. Back in Michigan, an F3 tornado killed one and injured five between Sharon Hollow and Ann Arbor. At the same time, another F3 tornado struck Highland Charter Township, injuring 11. A massive,  wide F2 tornado then hit the north side of Oscoda, killing four and injuring 13. An F3 tornado then touched down and caused considerable damage on the south side of Spruce, although it was the only significant (F2+) tornado of the day to not cause casualties. The strongest and deadliest tornado then touched down and struck the northern suburbs of Flint, Michigan in the community of Beecher at F5 intensity with little to no warning. The large  wide tornado obliterated and swept away many homes and a staggering 113 people lost their lives in the town alone. The tornado killed a total of 116 people and injured 844 others. After that tornado lifted, the same cell produced the final tornado of the day. The large, long tracked,  wide F4 tornado carved a  path of destruction through rural Lapeer and St. Clair Counties, injuring 23, thus becoming the only violent tornado of the outbreak sequence to not cause any fatalities. In all, 12 tornadoes touched down on June 8, killing 142 people and injuring 1,293 others.

June 9 produced a small, but unusually intense outbreak of four tornadoes in New England. Despite knowing that there was the possibility of tornadoes that day, the National Weather Service in Boston had only issued a Severe Thunderstorm Watch, fearing that the mention of a tornado threat would cause widespread panic. This proved to be a fatal mistake when a violent,  wide F4 tornado struck Worcester, Massachusetts with no warning. The hardest hit area was Assumption College (building is now the Quinsigamond Community College), and its surrounding neighborhoods, where 42 people were killed. The college building was reduced by three floors and numerous homes were obliterated, leaving some to speculate that the tornado reached F5 intensity in this area. A tornado warning was not issued until the tornado was lifting 80 minutes after it had touched down. By then, 94 people were dead and 1,228 others were injured. In the end, the tornadoes of June 9 in New Hampshire and Massachusetts killed 94 and injured 1,250.

Overall, at least 50 tornadoes touched down, including six violent tornadoes. The outbreak injured 2,562 people while killing 247, accounting for a little over 47% of the fatalities from 1953 alone. Many revolutionary changes were made to improve both the warning and radar systems as a result of this outbreak.

June 27

A small, but damaging outbreak of five tornadoes struck Iowa and North Dakota. The worst tornado was a violent F5 tornado that destroyed four farms east of Anita, Iowa, with virtually nothing left at one of them. Heavy machinery was thrown hundreds of feet, and boards were driven into trees. One person was killed and two others were injured. As a whole, the outbreak killed one and injured five.

July
There were 32 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July.

August
There were 24 tornadoes confirmed in the US in August.

September
There were 5 tornadoes confirmed in the US in September.

October
There were 6 tornadoes confirmed in the US in October.

November
There were 12 tornadoes confirmed in the US in November.

December
There were 21 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December.

December 1–6

Although usually a quiet month, the first six days of December were extremely destructive and deadly as a series of single damaging tornado days and small outbreaks combined into a tornado outbreak sequence of 19 tornadoes across the South. On December 2, a brief, but strong F2 tornado killed two and injured five west of Navasota, Texas. The next day, a  wide, violent F4 tornado tracked  through four Parishes in Louisiana. Passing northwest of Alexandria, the tornado killed nine and injured 50. The worst day of the outbreak sequence occurred on December 5, when four strong to violent tornadoes struck the Lower Mississippi Valley. The strongest and deadliest tornado was a  wide violent F5 tornado that struck Vicksburg, Mississippi. Many buildings were leveled, although most were frail in nature, causing some experts to rate this as an F4 tornado. Regardless, 38 people were killed and 270 others were injured along the  path of destruction. In fact, tornadoes on this day killed 38 and injured 292 people alone. In the end, the outbreak sequence killed 49 and injured 404.
The primitive clay oven, or earthen oven / cob oven, has been used since ancient times by diverse cultures and societies, primarily for, but not exclusive to, baking before the invention of cast-iron stoves, and gas and electric ovens. The general build and shape of clay ovens were, mostly, common to all peoples, with only slight variations in size and in materials used to construct the oven. In primitive courtyards and farmhouses, earthen ovens were built on the ground. 

In Arabian, Middle Eastern and North African societies, bread was often baked within a clay oven called in some Arabic dialects a tabun (also transliterated taboon, from the), or else in a clay oven called a tannour, and in other dialects mas'ad. The clay oven, synonymous with the Hebrew word tannour, lit. 'oven', was shaped like a truncated cone, with an opening either at the top or bottom from which to stoke the fire. Others were made cylindrical with an opening at the top. Built and used in ancient times as the family, neighbourhood, or village oven, clay ovens continue to be made in parts of the Middle East today.

History and usage
The earthen oven has historically been used to bake flatbreads such as taftoon (Persian: تافتون), taboon bread and laffa, and has been in widespread use in the greater Middle East for centuries. Aside from baking, some were used for cooking when pots were laid within the cavity of the oven and set upon hot coals covered in ashes. If the pots were intended to be left in the oven for an extended period of time (such as the night of the Sabbath day in Jewish culture where the food is left to cook until the next day), they would cover the opening at the top of the oven with a large, earthenware vessel.
 They would then add old rags around this vessel used to seal-up the oven, in order to make the oven impervious to air around all the cooking pots. Where the opening was on the side, the door which covered the opening required to be left partially open to allow for combustion of the fire and coals during its initial lighting. The earthen oven differed slightly from earthen stoves and ranges where, in the case of the latter, the pots were laid directly over the stove and a fire stoked below.

Middle Eastern types

Tabun

Gustaf Dalman (1855–1941), describing the material culture of Palestine in the early 20th century, photographed several types of clay ovens which he saw in use there. Of those ovens used for baking bread, there was the tabun shaped like a large, bottomless earthenware pot turned upside down and fastened permanently to the ground. It has a pebbled floor made of either smooth beach pebbles or limestone pebbles. The pot-shaped contour was wider at the base and narrower at the top, where the opening was, used both for kindling the fire, and for inserting dough for baking. A second, similar type of oven had, in addition to the hole at the top, a second side opening called the "eye of the oven", used for stoking the fire and clearing away the ashes, and closed by a detachable door. This type had a ceramic floor. Both versions were equipped with a ceramic lid with a handle, used for covering and sealing the top opening (see illustration). These ovens were, typically, small in size and were placed within a baking hut to protect them from the elements. Some tabun ovens were "dug-ins", half built into the ground and half above-ground. Baking was made on the pebbled floor of the oven, after the bowl-like exterior wall of the clay oven that sat over the floor like an inverted cup had been covered, itself, with hot coals and embers scattered with ash, usually placed atop dried cattle dung.

Tannour / tannur; tandoor
The word tannour is originally Persian and is often used in the Arabic and Hebrew languages in a generic sense, meaning, a place where bread is baked by fire. In Yemen, the most common of clay ovens served both for baking and cooking. Its shape was cylindrical and reached half the height of man, and was made with a wide-open top, called the "mouth of the oven" (Arabic: bâb al-manaq), its top being uniform in diameter with that of the oven's base. Kindling was admitted through the opening in the top. A small air-hole was also made therein at the base of the oven, called the "eye of the oven," which was made to ensure sufficient air circulation, as well as used to clear out the oven from its accumulated wood-ash. This oven had a flat, detachable ceramic lid made for it, with its own distinct rim, and which lid covering could be placed on its top and could hold additional pots and pans when needed. In such ovens, flat dough was pressed against the interior wall of the oven, whereunto it adhered until it was baked. Unleavened bread at Passover was made in the same way. The sealed pot containing the Yemenite-Jewish kubaneh was also placed in such ovens, laid upon the oven floor, upon its dying embers. Pots containing viands and kettles of coffee were first brought to a boil and then kept hot by brushing aside the coals and embers to one side of the oven, covering the coals over with ashes, and placing the pots and kettles beside the ash-covered coals. Such ovens were almost always built within baking rooms (Arabic: al-daymeh = الديمة) or rustic kitchens adjoining a courtyard.

The tannour described by Dalman in Palestine stood approximately  to  high, was cylindrical and made of clay. It measured  to  wide on the bottom and narrowed upwards. From the varied ovens described by him, an earthen oven may or may not be buried in the ground; it can be cylindrical, egg-shaped, pointed or curved. If necessary, it was also possible to convert a large water jug into a tannour. The Tandoor, more commonly called as such in India, Pakistan and in Azerbaijan, is related to the tannour.

In cylindrical clay ovens used in Palestine in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, and where the opening was on top, they were often equipped with a flat, detachable lid (tablet) made of clay and which was usually perforated to allow for the retention of heat when needed, and the smoke to be emitted. 

In some societies, such as in the villages around Aleppo, in Syria, the earthen oven (tannour) was vaulted and egg-shaped, the opening of which was made in the front, and the entire structure built above-ground by having it propped-up upon an earth and stone base. Its outer shell was thick, and could be anywhere between a handbreadth to  in thickness. Such shapes were typically found in Europe and in the British isles. In Europe and Britain, however, bread was baked on the floor of the oven, usually made of brick or tile. The dome-shaped oven in western societies was often built upon a stone and earth plinth to make it higher and easier to use, without having to bend over. Some ovens were made with flues; others without.

Furn / Purnei / Purnah
The furn is a furnace-like oven, the name being a loanword borrowed from the Greek (φούρνος, fūrnos) and earlier Latin, and which, according to Maimonides, was also made of clay.

The eleventh-century talmudic exegete, Rashi, who was of the Jewish Diaspora in France, explained its meaning as being "our large ovens whose mouths are at their side" (i.e., masonry oven).

The 10th-century Arab geographer al-Muqaddasī describes the furn that he had seen widely used in his day, writing: "The peasantry all of them possess ovens called furn, and those of them who can get burnt bricks make small bread-ovens (tannûr) in the ground. They line these with pebbles, and kindling the fire of dried-dung within and above, they afterwards remove the hot ashes and place the loaves of bread to bake upon these pebbles when they have become thus red-hot."

Gustaf Dalman (1855–1941) describes the furn which he had seen in Palestine, most of which were made of clay, as being mostly small and built with two compartments – the lower, a "boiler room" used to stoke the fire and which rests upon the ground; the upper, a "baking room" where the round leavened dough was laid down upon a flat surface and heated from below. In Palestine, these ovens also bore the additional name of ʻarṣa (qarṣa). In new furns that had yet to be fired, there was a danger of its dividing compartment collapsing or crumbling apart at its first firing. Based on samples of bread collected in Palestine, the leavened flatbread baked in a furn could be as large as, or smaller than, the flatbread baked in a tannour.

The furn in modern parlance is also associated with being a "public bakery," where flat-loaves of bread are baked wholesale to be sold in market, or where, in some countries, local villagers bring there certain produce, such as heaps of green chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) with their husks for roasting (when placed either in a clay oven or upon a convex griddle, known as ṣāj), or the flat round bread made with an impression containing omelettes.

Saj
The saj (ṣāğ), though also used in baking, is unlike the clay oven. It is rather a convex griddle made of metal, on which is spread a thin, unleavened dough. Dalman describes it in 1935 as being used by Bedouins from Syria all the way to Arabia, because it can be transported, unlike the tābūn and tannūr. It is still used today by Bedouins and other Arabs in Israel-Palestine, as well as by the indigenous peoples of Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, although the ingredients used in making their bread differ. The saj is made to rest upon large stones and a fire is lit beneath it.

Yemeni ovens
In Yemeni households, the kitchen or bake-room was built adjacent to an open-air courtyard and furnished with a hearth (maḥall et-tanâwir) which was freestanding, consisting of a socle with mud-bricks or masonry stones arranged in a bed of lime mortar, usually  in length,  to  in height, and  in breadth. Built into this socle were three separate ovens (tannûr, pl. tanâwir). The space in between the ovens was often filled with sifted wood ash, instead of soil, because of its light weight and its ability to heat quickly and retain the heat. In the early 20th-century, German ethnographer Carl Rathjens described the ovens that he had seen in the Old City of Sana'a, and which were similarly constructed by Jews and Arabs alike:

The product of Jewish potters, they (i.e. the clay ovens) are made of burnt clay and look like round pots without bottoms, being open at both ends and having a semi-circular hole on one side. They are built into the mortar base in such a way that the side-hole (bâb al-manâq) is in the front, about fifteen centimeters above the floor. Through this hole, wood, charcoal or dried dung is fed into the stove, and the cooking pots are placed on the upper opening.

Terracotta baking covers of ancient Italy
The words clibani (Latin) / κλίβανοι (Greek) denote "baking oven" in their respective languages. The words are transcribed in, both, the Greek Septuagint (q.v. Leviticus 11:35) and in Jerome's Latin Vulgate (op. cit.), and are often mentioned by Greek and Latin authors under the name clibanus, the use of which seems to have entailed baking in what Roman authors have called sub testus, in which the ingredients were cooked under an earthenware cover, over which ashes were heaped. Others suggest that a space on the floor was cleared upon which a small heap of lighted coals was set. The baking cover was then placed or hung over the coals, and when sufficiently hot, it was raised and the coals swept aside. The dough was then put onto the hot floor, at which time the hot cover was replaced over the dough. Coals were then heaped over the sides of the cover and the bread left to bake.

Based on other literary and archaeological finds, scholars have identified five principal methods of baking in Roman Italy, which, in addition to the above baking cover method (similar to the tabun in Arabic-speaking countries), families also practised baking directly onto hot ashes and cinders, whereby bread was placed on leaves or pieces of tile set on a low hearth and covered by embers from the fire. Today, such bread is known as an ash cake. Small stationary ovens were later introduced in Italy, built into a kitchen range. Afterwards, even larger and more efficient ovens were made, namely, the furnus (masonry oven). Another type included a portable version of the clibanus.

Preparatory steps before baking

Fuel
Many types of fuel or a combination of fuels can heat an earthen oven. Dried animal dung, dried bird droppings, chopped and dried tree branches or tree trimmings, wood chips, charcoal, were all used as potential fuels, depending on the country.

In Yemen, they made use of combustible fuels that were made available to them, the best wood comprising ḍahya (Arabic: الضهياء = Acacia asak) or qaraḍ (Arabic: قرض = Acacia etbaica; A. nilotica kraussiana), and which was usually sold in the Wood Market. The poor made use of tamarisk trees (Tamarix nilotica) for kindling.

Occasionally, there was no need for a large fire, such as when they baked laḥūḥ (the sponge-like flat bread), or when roasting kernels, legumes and grain, and things similar. In such cases, they merely made use of a light and inexpensive heating material. For this purpose, the Arab women would carry large baskets of leaves and splinters upon their heads, such which fall from the trees, especially the deciduous leaves of the tamarisk, which is plenteous there and is called hamal. Briquettes prepared from the waste droppings of animals were also used to light a fire in the clay oven, and which are processed and dried by the Arab villagers. The best of these were those made from the droppings of sheep, and the least useful of them all were those made from donkey manure.

Firing

Where clay ovens are made with a top opening, it is covered and when coffee was to be prepared in kettles, they were laid on top of such ovens with the initial kindling of the fire. In the case of a tabun oven where there was no top opening, a layer of fuel (usually dried manure) is spread on the outside of the shell and lid. Once the fire takes hold, the fuel is covered with a layer of ash. When damp wood was used, the fuel would smolder for hours, filling the baking rooms with the smoke. After the initial flames had died down a little, the kettles were removed from the oven's top, and the oven at this time was ready to receive the prepared dough that was made to cling to the inner-wall of the oven. The amount of fuel varies depending on the amount of baking that was needed.

In Yemen, whenever the woman of the house wished to light a fire in her tannour, she would take-up a little of each kind of wood kindling and arrange them in the oven. First, she would place thin splinters (luṣwah; Arabic: لصوة) or twigs within the mouth of the oven, and directly on top of it she would place thin pieces of wood, followed by thicker pieces of wood. On the two sides of the wood pile she would set up two briquettes of sheep dung (kiba; Arabic: الكبا), and then she would set down over the stove all the cooking pots and the coffee kettles that needed heating. The most important splinters for lighting were the jiʿdin, which is a bush where there was a sticky, elastic-like flammable substance between its bark and wood. The substance was flammable and would light quickly. The fire is started in the oven by inserting a burning rag or paper.

Baking
When the smoke resides, the lid is removed and chunks of dough are hand flattened and placed directly on the limestones (in the case of tabun oven). In most ovens, 4 to 5 loaves can be baked at the same time. Then the opening is sealed and the fire stoked using the hot embers and ashes. When the bread is ready, the lid is removed and the bread taken out. The process can be repeated, or other dishes can be baked using metal or pottery trays. The bottom of the bread will take the shape of the pebbles or other materials used in constructing the oven floor. This baking process is unique and economical and produces aromatic and flavorful food.

In Yemen, when the fire was kindled in the larger tannour and all pot-filled dishes began to boil, the flames were allowed to die down a little. The householder who tended the cooking then removed the cooking pots and the coffee kettles from off the stove top, and would then begin to bake the bread on the inner walls of the oven. The flattened dough is applied to the inner-wall of the oven, after the wall is dampened with a wet cloth, allowing for adhesion. The dough was traditionally flattened-out on a maḫbazeh – the round, knitted baker's kerchief or pillow used for protection when sticking the dough into the oven, fitted snugly with a cloth. The dough was spread out firmly upon the maḫbazeh, until it was sufficiently thin, and was then applied to the interior wall of the earthen oven, so as to bake it on its obverse side. If the bare hands were used to apply the dough, the baker would baste the surface of the dough with the water obtained from soaking ground fenugreek seeds, to prevent the dough from sticking to the baker's hand when applying it to the inner surface of the oven. When bubble-like configurations appeared on the surface of the bread, it signaled that it was ready. 

After baking, the bread is removed. If there was much to bake, the householder would put within the mouth of the oven a dry piece of wood so that the flame of its burning will cook and cause to steam the outer layer of the bread. This piece of wood is called in Arabic mudhwa. When he finished baking, he then placed within the oven a knotted piece of wood, of the kind which are hardest to burn, usually taken from the place where the shoots sprout from the tree's trunk. The householder added thereto a cake of sheep dung and would bury the wood and cake of sheep dung in the midst of the fire, covering them over with a thin layer of ash, so that they would burn slowly and the oven would remain hot for a long time. This covering of ash is called in Arabic tubnah. To keep the cooked dishes hot, the householder would lay up within the earthen oven all her cooking pots and the coffee kettles around the meager pile of ash-covering, and then seal the side-opening of the oven by inserting its removable door-like covering. In Jewish culture, especially on days where it was impossible to build a fire, but where prolonging the existing heat of the oven was necessary, the hot coals were, in advance, pushed to one side and covered over in ashes, while the entire clay oven was covered over with a larger earthenware vessel, to which old rags were added along the edges to seal the heat within it. In so doing, whenever dishing out soup or pouring a drink of coffee, they would remain hot.

Experienced bakers knew when they needed only a light heat, such as when roasting grain or baking lahoh, in which cases they would add inexpensive light wood to the oven. In 18th-century English clay ovens, whenever the temperature of the clay oven became too hot, they were frequently doused with cold water, or its flooring swabbed with a wet mop.

Method of construction
In the Land of Israel during classical times, the baking oven (Hebrew: tannour) was constructed in similar fashion as the tabun (popularly in use amongst Arabs). Like the tabun, it too was made like unto a large, bottomless eathenware pot, turned upside down and fixed permanently onto the ground by plastering it with clay, usually in a family's courtyard where there was a baking hut.

These smaller pot-shaped ovens are made of yellow pottery clay soil. The soil is wetted and made into a thick clay mixed with chopped stubble and straw from harvested wheat. The clay is hand-formed to make the dome-shaped shell. It is about  to  in diameter at its base, about  to  high, with an open top, approximately  in diameter. The shell wall is about  to  thick. The shell is sun baked for weeks, before it is fired.

Some clay ovens were made higher and cylindrical with a wide-open top. The inner-most layer of the clay oven consists of about 2 parts of sand to 1 part clay, thoroughly mixed together. Such ovens were made with thick walls, as much as , by adding to its outer shell and wall a cob of wet clay (or black earth) consisting of an aggregate of dried and burnt donkey or horse manure ground to a powdery ash (about 40%), a smaller portion of chopped straw and stubble, along with lime and sand or gravel. Others had a practice of adding burnt clay, ground pieces of terracotta or an admixture of clay and charcoal. This application was followed by an outer coating of clay, which was then smoothed out across the entire surface of the oven. Some reinforced the oven by inserting small stones and pebbles in the clay surrounding the oven. The process of thickening the walls helped to retain the oven's heat once it had been fired. Where clay ovens were made in a conical shape, they usually did not require the construction of a flue pipe. The wide side-opening served as a place of intake of air (oxygen), allowing for proper combustion of fuel, besides being a place for the egress of air and smoke. Other clay ovens that had, both, a top opening and bottom side-opening ("eye of the oven"), the function of the side-opening was to insert fuel and to remove excess ashes. 

All newly built clay-ovens require a first firing before they can be used to bake bread. Firing was done by burning dried manure inside the oven. This is done, not only to harden the clay and to enable dough to cling to the inner oven-wall after its second firing, but also to temper the oven so that it can better retain heat. The thickness of the oven wall (ca. 6 inches) helps preserve residual heat. As a modern-day improvisation, some baking ovens are made from a half-cut metal barrel that encloses a thinly-made clay oven of the same height, and where the intermediate space between the metal barrel and clay oven is filled with sand.

During his lifetime he used the aliases Lone Wolf, Archie Arlingtone, E.D. McGrath, U.S. Forest Service Ranger Gorham, and his preferred alias, Monte Wolfe. 

His early life was characterized by repeated family homestead migrations to the Minnesota and Dakota Territories, then on to California, and Washington state. At each homestead location, the family built log cabins and barns, dug wells, and planted wheat and other crops. Skills Archie maintained throughout this life.

tioneering post-Spanish American War Aviator, aeroplane mechanic, and Sailor with the Great White Fleet. He was also a skilled cowboy and 20 mule teamster, a prospector and miner for gold and coal, and a lone winter fur trapper with a vast trap line that ran from Northern Yosemite to Lake Tahoe. 

In his later years, he became widely known as a notorious nighttime campsite “visitor”. A ghost in the wilderness.

He was a highly skilled builder of log structures like barns, cabins, and out-structures and he worked alone. His most impressive log cabin survives, deep in the Mokelumne Wilderness to this day.

Navy Career 
Archie Edwin Wright was born on April 20, 1886 in the Dakota Territory. In 1900, when he was 13 years old, his family migrated west by covered wagon along the Oregon Trail, crossing into California over the treacherous Donner Pass settling in California’s northlands  to grow olives in Corning, California. After two years, the family had saved enough to sell the Corning homestead and purchase a section of land and farm in Washington state’s Palouse region to grow  wheat. The Wright’s homesteading days were over.

In 1907, when he was 21, it was time for him to leave the farm. He joined the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the wooden sailing ship  for training in San Francisco Bay. The three masted, single screw steamer had been built by the Union during the American Civil War. Today, the Pensacola wreck rests, burnt, in the shallows of San Francisco Bay, near San Francisco International Airport.

After training, Archie’s first duty assignment was aboard the  a first generation Armored Cruiser, where the he cruised the Pacific Ocean with the Great White Fleet. While the entire fleet was anchored in San Francisco Bay for a Naval Review there was an incident aboard the USS California. The USS California was to receive their ceremonial silver service by California’s governor, the Secretary of Defense, and the Great White Fleet’s commanding officer, Admiral Uriel Sebree the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet.

According to the logbook of the USS California, Archie was disciplined three times during their stay in the Bay. The first offense was using foul language in the presence of civilian visitors, the next two offenses were reparation for his obstinance. After his third stay in the USS California’s brig, he decided to walk. While docked in Vallejo Junction on San Francisco Bay awaiting access to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard he gathered his uniforms and disposed of them, then in the early morning hours of June 16, 1908 he walked off the ship and traveled east, and inland. After that event, his fear of Naval reprisal colored his decisions, and stayed with him for the rest of his life.

Domestic Bliss in Modesto 
He spent the ensuing six months living the life of a 21 year old hobo on the run; looking for work; riding the rails and sleeping wherever he laid his head. In early 1908, he found himself in Modesto, CA. He had met the love of his life, Goldie Faye Coolidge, a local farmer’s daughter and relative of future President Calvin Coolidge. But, he was still hungry and cold.

Arrested in Stanislaus County 

After illegally entering a vacated farmhouse in Stanislaus County, and absconding with canned food and used clothing he was tracked down, arrested, tried, and convicted of 2nd Degree Burglary, his first offense. 

He was sentenced by the Stanislaus County Superior Court to 18 months hard labor at the notorious Folsom State Prison under an “old law” mandating stiff sentences for first-time offenders. Expecting a slap on the wrist, he was dumbfounded when he received his sentence. He spent the next 18 months hammering granite in the prison quarry, and ruminating about his ‘unfair’ treatment just when his life was beginning to improve.

Marriage and Family 

On the day of Archie’s release from  prison, he immediately boarded a train to Spokane and the Palouse in Washington state. Goldie Faye awaited there and they were immediately married. The infants started nine months later, and Goldie bore four, in four years; Goldie Ina, Edwin, Glenn, and Norman.

Archie found work as a clerk in Modesto, CA, but with six mouths to feed, he needed a higher paying job. He later landed a job as a lumberjack at the Westside Lumber Company, and later as a Timberman and mucker in the Eagle Shawmut Mine near Tuolumne City, California. Goldie took a job as camp cook at the Westside Lumber Company.

The 2nd Aero Squadron 

In 1916, a rift opened between Goldie Faye and Archie; the cause is lost to time. Archie collected his last paycheck at the mine, traveled to San Francisco, and joined the U.S. Army. He was immediately shipped to Fort Mills on Corregidor in the Philippines and assigned to the 2nd Aero Squadron  in the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays. Letters sent home to Goldie Faye with paychecks indicate that Archie dearly missed his children and Goldie.

The Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps activated the Second Aero Squadron on 12 May 1915. It was the second to be organized in the United States Army, as noted by its numerical designation. It was organized at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California, where the only Aviation School at that time was located, and it was from this school that most of its squadron members came from. Other members were taken from the 1st Aero Squadron, which was the only completely equipped squadron in the Army.

It was the policy of the Aviation School to completely train and equip a squadron before sending it into the field. The squadron consisted of six flying officers and thirty-nine enlisted men, primarily mechanics. Two officers and ten men were transferred from the 1st Aero Squadron. The USAT Sheridan sailed from San Francisco for Manila on 5 January 1916 whith the squadron. After two weeks of quarantine, the unit reached its station on Corregidor on 14 February without aircraft. It was the first complete aviation unit assigned outside of the United States.

The 2nd received four Martin S-Hydro seaplanes (Signal Corps numbers 56-59) on 13 March and 15 April, and began flying on 8 May 1916. For the first time ever, an aeroplane was equipped with  experimental radio transmitter, giving the aircraft a broadcast range of 29 miles. On 28 June, the company provided artillery spotting and adjustment, another first, for target practice with the Fort Mills batteries. Personnel for a second company were assembled and the unit was re-designated the 1st Company, 2nd Aero Squadron on 20 July 1917. The 2nd Company, 2nd Aero Squadron received two Wright Brothers aeroplanes and was based, in Hawaii.

As the U.S. entry into World War 1 approached, the 2nd Aero Squadron was redeployed to Kelly Field in San Antonio, TX. The voyage was to originate in Manila, with stopovers in Guam and Hawaii before arriving in San Francisco, CA. The following morning, the airmen boarded a train and began their final leg to Kelly Field. Archie never made it to the train. He had to go home to Goldie and his kids in Modesto.

But… he was too late. In desperation for her family, Goldie had met another man and subsequently became pregnant in 1918.

Goldie soon moved with the, now five children to Sacramento. Archie retreated to the Sierra Nevada mountains where he would spend the rest of is life, alone. Initially, he found work as a cowboy and prospector. Upon the arrival of the World War 1 draft, Wright registered as "Monte Wolfe, Prospector”

Retreat from society 
In the Sierra, Wolfe worked a number of jobs to earn the income he needed, including trapping, prospecting, and working as a fishing and hunting guide. At this point, he had not yet withdrawn from wider society altogether. That would change in 1927, when Wolfe had another run-in with law enforcement – he was arrested for felony burglary and spent 75 days awaiting trial in a Tuolumne County jail. In his trial that took place after this delay, the jury found Wolfe not guilty; however, upon acquittal, the county sheriff drove him to the city of Angels Camp in nearby Calaveras County, "unceremoniously dumped" him there, and told him to never again set foot in Tuolumne County.

According to historian Eric Jung, a Bear Valley businessman, historian, and author, this series of events made Wolfe "finally decide 'I've had enough of people'". For the rest of his life he would live off the land in a rugged area deep in the Sierra’s Mokelumne River forests.

Life in the Sierra 

In the canyon of the Mokelumne River, Wolfe built himself two log cabins, where he lived for the rest of his life. Friends came to visit from time to time, and he occasionally ventured into the general store and bars along the highway about ten miles away. Aside from that, he lived as a hermit, and was entirely self-sufficient.

Disappearance 
One day late in the spring of 1940, three of Wolfe's friends – the brothers Art, Harry, and Reuben Schimke – set out to visit Wolfe in his cabin. Upon their arrival, they found the cabin empty, and could not find Wolfe. The last date crossed off on his calendar had been April 20 – his birthday – of that same year. It is unknown what caused Wolfe's disappearance and presumed death, but the surviving Schimke brothers believe it was unintentional. Wolfe had been suffering from some chronic health problems, which could have made him more likely to fall victim to an accident.

Cabin preservation dispute 
Monte Wolfe's first cabin was destroyed by Forest Service workers sometime before 2009. His second cabin remains standing to this day. This cabin, one of the last surviving pioneer structures in California built by one person entirely by hand, has become embroiled in a dispute between wilderness protection and historic preservation
After passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, the ground upon which the cabin sits became part of the newly designated Mokelumne Wilderness. Wilderness area regulations generally prohibit the maintenance or construction of any buildings or structures not necessary to patrolling and maintaining the wilderness itself. As a result, rangers have at times sought to speed up the natural decay of the cabin, while preservationists have attempted to maintain it. The two groups at one point reached an agreement to leave the cabin as is in a state of "arrested decay", but both sides have accused the other side of violating this agreement.
"One out of Many" is a short story within an unconventionally formatted novel entitled In a Free State, written by V. S. Naipaul and originally published by André Deutsch in 1971. The protagonist, Santosh, is forced to give up his familiar life inside the stratified castes  of India to move with his employer, now an Indian ambassador, to Washington D.C during the civil rights protests and commensurate "hippie era". Themes developed in the story reflect Santosh's abrupt displacement from a comfortable, life-long acclimation in India, to an alien environment in the United States, where his beliefs, perceptions, and sense of belonging are upended.

About the author

V. S. Naipaul was a Trinidadian and Tobagonian British. He wrote works of fiction and nonfiction in English.  He is known for his comedic early novels set in Trinidad, his bleaker novels of alienation in the wider world, and his vigilant chronicles of life and travels. He wrote in prose that was widely admired.

He published more than thirty books over fifty years. Naipaul won the Booker Prize in 1971 for his novel In a Free State.  In 1989, he was awarded the Trinity Cross, Trinidad and Tobago's highest national honour.  He received a knighthood in Britain in 1990, and in 2001, the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Transfusion-dependent anemia is a form of anemia characterized by the need for continuous blood transfusion. It is a condition that results from various diseases, and is associated with decreased survival rates. Regular transfusion is required to reduce the symptoms of anemia by increasing functional red blood cells and hemoglobin count. Symptoms may vary based on the severity of the condition and the most common symptom is fatigue.
Various diseases can lead to transfusion-dependent anemia, most notably myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and thalassemia. Due to the number of diseases that can cause transfusion-dependent anemia, diagnosing it is more complicated. Transfusion dependence occurs when an average of more than 2 units of blood transfused every 28 days is required over a period of at least 3 months. Myelodysplastic syndromes is often only diagnosed when patients become anemic, and transfusion-dependent thalassemia is diagnosed based on gene mutations. Screening for heterozygosity in the thalassemia gene is an option for early detection.

The transfusions itself alleviates the symptoms of anemia, and are used to treat the disease that causes transfusion dependence. The recommended restrictive threshold for blood transfusion is a hemoglobin level of 7 to 8 g/dL, while a more liberal threshold is set at 9 to 10 g/dL. However, more evidence may be required to establish a consensus on the threshold and a personalized approach may be more useful. The main complication of transfusion dependence is iron overloading, which can damage the liver, heart, bone tissue and endocrine glands. Iron chelation therapy is used to treat iron overload and common iron chelators used are deferoxamine, deferiprone and deferasirox. Due to the complications of transfusions dependency, it may be more ideal to directly treat the cause of anemia if possible. However this might not be suitable for all patients, and some may still rely on frequent blood transfusions for survival. While transfusion-dependent anemia has a poor prognosis, advancement in iron chelation therapy may help increase survival rates.

Signs and symptoms 
See more: Anemia

When transfusion dependent patients do not receive their transfusion, symptoms of anemia may arise. The most common symptom that patients experience is fatigue, and other symptoms include shortness of breath, dizziness and heart palpitations. Symptoms may vary depending on the severity of the disease. The use of blood transfusions can ease some of these symptoms by replenishing the blood cells and maintain sufficient hemoglobin levels, however, the goal to improve the overall oxygen-carrying capacity has conflicting results.

Causes 
There are numerous causes for transfusion dependent anemia, typically due to diseases affecting the blood.

Thalassemia

Alpha-thalassemia 
Hemoglobin Barts hydrops fetalis is the most severe form of alpha-thalassemia, and individuals with this disease have severe anemia during the fetal stage of development. It has been considered as fatal until advances in treatment were made. Patients that survive hemoglobin Barts hydrops fetalis will become transfusion dependent.

Beta-thalassemia 
Bata-thalassemia causes decreased functional hemoglobin production, and blood transfusions can be given to maintain a sufficient hemoglobin level. Patients with beta thalassemia major are more affected and are recommended to receive transfusion throughout their lives.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
Myelodysplastic syndromes are disorders where defective blood cells are produced by an abnormal bone marrow, resulting in anemia. Severe cases may require ongoing transfusions, and around 70% of people with myelodysplastic syndromes become transfusion dependent at some point. Patients who are initially considered to be lower-risk may experience disease progression as a result of becoming dependent on blood transfusion when they become increasingly unresponsive to alternative treatments.

Diagnosis 
Diagnosis of transfusion dependent anemia is challenging because this anemia is caused by multiple diseases. Therefore, other than diagnosing anemias that require transfusion, diagnosis for the two main causes (beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) of transfusion dependent anemia is also important.

Transfusion dependent anemia 
Diagnosis of transfusion-dependent anemia is similar to the diagnosis of all other kinds of anemia, which primarily depends on one's complete blood count. Units of red blood cells required is examined to diagnose transfusion dependent anemia. Patients that need more than 2 units of red blood cells every 28 days are considered transfusion dependent. Diagnosed patients require frequent and regular transfusion for survival.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
As 70% of myelodysplastic syndrome patients exhibit transfusion dependent anemia, diagnosis of MDS can also help indicate transfusion dependency. Diagnosis of it is complexed with great diversity of symptoms, and therefore most patients are only diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndromes when seeking clinical advice after experiencing symptoms of anemia.

Beta-thalassemia 
Beta-thalassemia is a genetic disease mostly caused by beta-globin gene mutations. Clinical diagnosis is based on interpretation of the peripheral blood smear, which examines red blood cell morphology, followed by hemoglobin analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. DNA analysis is performed by either mutation-specific detection or genome scanning. Different mutation patterns observed from DNA analysis divide thalassemia patients into three classes: thalassemia major (TM), thalassemia intermedia (TI) and thalassemia minor (TI). Another classification was established in 2012 for easier referral of patients that require frequent transfusion for survival, dividing patients into non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) and transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) by their baseline hemoglobin levels. Thalassemia major is usually manifested in fetus and early life (birth to <2 years old) and all patients are transfusion-dependent from birth in order to survive. Anemia experienced by some thalassemia intermedia patients are also regarded transfusion dependent. Therefore, most transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients can be diagnosed within the first few years of life, which severe anemia, differed growth, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly can be observed. Parameters for confirmation includes baseline hemoglobin level <7g/dL, enlargement of liver and spleen (>5 cm) and height in the first 10th percentile.

Screening

Thalassemia 
Screening programs are available to identify thalassemia patients among the general public. Couples are in particular the target group of screening for early identification of carriers who bear risks of having children with thalassemia. Screenings targeted at them are done by detecting heterozygotes in the thalassemia gene. Whereas screening of fetus is done by one-tube osmotic fragility test (identification of red blood cells resistance to hemolysis), red blood cell tests (measurement of mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin) or dischlorophenol indophenol precipitation tests (detection of mutation).

Treatment 
The primary method to treat transfusion-dependent anemia is by transfusing packed red blood cells. Transfusion is also one of the treatment strategies for beta-thalassemia patients and patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although transfusion of red blood cells cannot correct the underlying problems, it can improve anemia conditions.

Side effects of treatment 
There are considerable side effects associated with the transfusion of red blood cells. Side effects include iron overloading, allergic reactions that lead to skin rashes and infections transmitted through transfusion.

The most common side effect is iron overloading, which the severity of overload depends on the frequency, volume, and the amount of blood transfused to the patient. Approximately, 200 to 250 mg of iron is transfused per unit of blood. Iron overloading is resulted because human body cannot excrete excess iron from frequent transfusions, leading to accumulation of iron in blood. Iron in blood causes damage to important organs, such as the heart, liver, bone tissue and endocrine glands. Damage to vital organs leads to morbidities, including cardiovascular diseases and heart failure. The liver is normally involved in iron metabolism and storage and excess iron causes liver diseases, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Complications associated with the endocrine hormones may also occur, including diabetes. The risk of developing transfusion dependency related morbidities increases with patients' ages.

Treatment to reduce iron overloading 
To reduce iron overloading in blood, iron chelation therapy is commonly used together with transfusion. Necessity to initiate iron chelation therapy is determined by blood test and transfusion volume.  Generally, blood with serum ferritin level that exceed 1000 ug/L and a transfusion of 20 units of red blood cells will require iron chelation therapy along with transfusion.

There are three common iron chelators, including deferoxamine, deferiprone and deferasirox.

Deferoxamine 
Deferoxamine is injected into the body through the veins and is the most traditional chelation therapy available. This therapy, although effective, especially for patients with heavy iron overload, is considered very inconvenient. The injection has to be performed over a duration of 8 hours, 5–7 times every week. Therefore, low compliance of patients is one of the major concerns of this therapy. Side effects include abnormal growth of bones and kidney damages. Deferoxamine is seldom used alone nowadays, but rather in combination with oral deferiprone to increase the effectiveness in reducing iron overload.

Deferiprone 
Deferiprone is an oral drug that is ingested by patients three times a day. Although patients are still required to visit the clinic frequently for complete blood count, the administering process by simply oral intake regularly is still less tedious when compared to deferoxamine. It is also effective in reducing cardiac-related diseases due to iron overloading. Major side effects of this drug are to the gastrointestinal system.

Defasirox 
Defasirox is also an oral drug to mitigate iron overloading taken one dose per day by patients. It shares similar benefits of convenience with deferiprone when compared to deferoxamine, but however is of the highest cost. Side effects to the gastrointestinal and urinary system are common.

The use of iron chelation therapy is not without concern. It can also cause skeletal changes that leads to bone disorders such as osteoporosis. Therefore, minimizing the need of transfusion when possible is still the best way in reducing iron overload.

Other than physical side effects brought by transfusion, transfusion also poses stress psychologically and financially. Inconvenience brought by frequent transfusion interferes with the normal social lives of patients. As a result, lack of social ties make patients more vulnerable to psychiatric illnesses like depression. The high cost for repeated transfusion can also cause financial burden on the patient and his/her family. Subjection to physical, psychological and financial stresses brought by frequent transfusions and its related morbidities worsen the quality of life of most patients as the disease progresses.

Alternative treatments 
As there are a number of drawbacks brought by frequent transfusions, directly treating the cause of anemia (e.g. myelodysplastic syndrome), if available, remains the optimal choice of treatment. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a treatment for thalassemia that minimizes the need of transfusion in long term. However, it is not suitable for patients with organs that have already experienced certain degree of iron overload, and it may only be applicable to strong and young patients. While for transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome patients, lenalidomide is approved for treating lower-risk patients and hypomethylating agents can be used to treat higher-risk patients.

Prognosis 
An International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is specially designed to access the prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Scores help to classify patients into low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high risks based on their severity levels. Patients in the lower-risk group generally have a longer survival range of 3–8.8 years, comparied to only 0.8–1.6 years for high-risk patients.

In general, the survival rate of transfusion-dependent anemia patients is increasing. This is due to the improvements in transfusion procedures, mature use of iron chelation therapies to reduce iron overloading, and more experiences in dealing with associated morbidities.
Gordimer is a crater on Mercury, near the north pole.  Its name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2019, after the South African writer Nadine Gordimer.

The southern floor of Gordimer is in permanent shadow.  S band radar data from the Arecibo Observatory collected between 1999 and 2005 indicates a radar-bright area covering the southern floor, which is probably indicative of a water ice deposit.

Tolkien crater is northwest of Gordimer, and Chesterton is to the northeast.  Tryggvadóttir is due north, at the pole.

Plot
The plot unfolds in a reverse-chronological fashion. The plot's focus is the life of protagonist Seena and the evolution of his character due to external forces that sway him in several directions. Women/lovers involved in Seena's life contribute to these forces that trigger the Metamorphosis of his character. He goes from being a garage mechanic to being a prominent leader in the underworld mafia.  

"Popcorn" Devi, one of the lovers, has a profound impact on Seena's life. The back story on how "Popcorn" Devi got involved with the underworld unfolds parallelly alongside Seena's story.

Soundtrack

Charan Raj scored the background music and soundtrack for the film. The soundtrack album comprises two tracks, the lyrics for which were written by Rithwik Kaikini and HanuManKind. The audio rights were bought by PRK Audio in December 2019.

Kaikini wrote the track "Maadeva" which featured lyrics in English. The song was initially titled "Wah Wah Wah" and was later changed to "Maadeva" by Raj by saying "The decision of using English vocals on this number was rather organic. For Maadeva, we worked according to the visuals, and when Suri reviewed, he said this met his expectations." Director Suri said, "So far, I would have helped create over 50 songs for the movies. At one stage, the interest wore off and I did not want any songs for this film. I needed a mood for a particular scene and asked composer Charan Raj. He and lyricists Ritwik Kaikini and HanuManKind came up with this. Once I delegate, I hand it over completely. I don't get much English, and my associate Amritha Bhargav explained the lyrics to me. The song made a lot of sense, and I went ahead with it."

Reception
The film opened with positive reviews from critics. Sunayna Suresh of Times of India gave 3.5 stars on 5 and said that "A Film for lovers of gore and the underworld". Aravind Shwetha of The News Minute gave it 3 stars on 5 and praised the reverse chronological screenplay of the film.

People's Revolutionary Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran was an armed political party in Iran.

Mohammad Montazeri, son of Ayatollah Montazeri, was in charge of SATJA but after his death in 1981, Mehdi Hashemi took over the group. The major activity of the SATJA and its magazine was to promote Muammar Gaddafi and insult Mostafa Chamran, Musa al-Sadr and Amal Movement.

As of Ronen A. Cohen, the SATJA's brief presence left a long trail that is even expressed in the current sensitive political-religious situation in Lebanon.

Origins 
The idea to create the SATJA was first formed before Iranian Revolution. The SATJA and the Forqan group had the same ideological nurturing, but each chose to emphasize different things. Ali Shariati's writings were used as an ideological platform by both the Forqan and the SATJA. The latter took Shariati's books — Shahadat and Pas az Shahadat — as an excuse to export the revolution, but never dealt with the other ideological insights of Shariati's agenda and only chose to use the one that served their aspiration to export the revolution.

Headquarters 
The SATJA was first established in a house in Takht-e Jamshīd Street in Tehran. Also, It is claimed that the SATJA's center was located in the building of The Ministry of Immigration Office on Shahrārā Street.

Activities 
Montazeri sent many of the SATJA members to Lebanon and Syria to fight Israel. He went to the Mehrabad Airport with his armed forces — whom were mostly young boys and girls — and volunteered to fight alongside the Palestinian guerrillas against Israel, after which he boarded the plane and went to fight Israel. Montazeri also had a close relationship with the tribal parties and leftists in Lebanon and SATJA published the magazine of Omīd-e Irān (Hope for Iran in Persian) as part of this activity.

Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur then-Ambassador of Iran to Syria was among of the SATJA's members.

In 2007, he acquired a Master of Science degree in Agroforestry from the same university. He also attended Ghana School of Law and obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree in law. He is an old student of Kumasi high school.

Politics 
Kokofu is a member of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). In 2012, he contested for the Bantama (Ghana parliament constituency) seat on the ticket of the NPP sixth parliament of the fourth republic and won. During the elections he garnered 49,054 votes, which represented 83.26% of the total valid votes cast, and hence defeated the other contestants including Samuel Yaw Adusei, Benjamin Owusu-Achaw, Jerry F. Akonnor, Nana Kwasi Abayie, Regina Serwaa Adjei and Samuel Appiah. He did not contest in the 2016 Ghanaian general elections; instead, Daniel Okyem Aboagye represented the New Patriotic Party and won. As a result, Kokofu served as the member of parliament for Bantama (Ghana parliament constituency) till 6 January2017.

Sparassis spathulata is a species of fungus in the genus Sparassis.
The Fort Bonifacio boundary dispute was a territorial disagreement between local governments in the Filipino cities of Makati and Taguig, and the municipality of Pateros. The dispute also includes the financial district of Bonifacio Global City (BGC).

Taguig has administration over Bonifacio Global City and some territory to its south as part of Fort Bonifacio. In addition, Pinagsama exercises control over the McKinley Hill area and Palar Village, while Barangay Ususan controls some exclaves along Circumferential Road 5 (C-5), such as Logcom Village, Wildcat Village, and Aranai. Makati claims the main BGC area, Palar Village and the lands along C5 up to the walls of Heritage Park to be under the jurisdiction of its barangays Post Proper Northside and Post Proper Southside, while Ususan's exclaves along the eastbound portion of C-5 are also claimed by Barangay Rizal and Barangay Pembo.

Pateros also claims to control the so-called Embo barangays of Makati and some barangays under Taguig. Pateros claim includes Bonifacio Global City. However the legal case it filed is separate from that of involving Makati and Taguig.

Background
The municipality of Pateros, the only municipality in Metro Manila and located near Fort Bonifacio, claims that its original land area was not its present land area of , but rather , including Fort Bonifacio. According to their claim, this also included barangays Comembo, Pembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Cembo, South Cembo and Pitogo (which are now part of Makati) and Bonifacio Global City, Aranai, Ususan, and Palar in Pinagsama (which was made part of Taguig), based on documents and official maps obtained from several libraries and offices, including the United States Library of Congress and National Archives.

Pateros' decrease in the territory was accounted to a cadastral mapping in Metro Manila conducted in 1978. The late Pateros Mayor Nestor Ponce challenged the map through an objection letter dated June 23, 1978. In January 1986, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 2475, which stated that Fort Bonifacio is in Makati, remaining open for disposition. Following these events, a boundary dispute arose which moved Pateros to request a dialogue with the Municipal Council of Makati in 1990. Pateros also filed a complaint against Taguig at the Makati RTC in 1996, but the trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The case was moved to the Court of Appeals in 2003 but was denied. The same case was moved to the Supreme Court in 2009, and it was denied again.

In 1993, the municipal government of Taguig filed a case against Makati before the Pasig Regional Trial Court (RTC), contending "that the areas comprising the Enlisted Men's Barangays (EMBOs), as well as the area referred to as Inner Fort in Fort Bonifacio, were within its territory and jurisdiction." The Pasig court ruled in favor of Taguig in 2011. Makati filed a motion for reconsideration at the Pasig RTC. At the same time, the city filed a petition for an annulment of judgment with the Court of Appeals.

The city governments of Makati and Taguig fought over the jurisdiction of Fort Bonifacio because of the area's growth potential. A portion of the base, including the Libingan ng mga Bayani and the Manila American Cemetery, lies within Taguig, while the northern portion, where the Global City development is centered, was considered part of Makati. A 2003 ruling by a judge in the Pasig Regional Trial Court upheld the jurisdiction of Taguig over the entirety of Fort Bonifacio, including the Bonifacio Global City and Pinagsama.

Supreme Court
On June 27, 2008, through Associate Justice Leonardo Quisumbing, the suit of the Makati was dismissed, seeking to nullify Special Patents 3595 and 3596 signed by Fidel Ramos conveying to the Bases Conversion and Development Authority public land in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig. Due to a pending civil case filed by the Taguig city government asking the court to define its territorial boundaries, Makati cannot halt Taguig from collecting taxes on land located in Fort Bonifacio because it does not have any other sufficient source of sufficient income.

Further rulings and appeals
On June 16, 2009, the Supreme Court, through Associate Justice Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura, denied Pateros’ petition against Taguig, but ruled that the boundary dispute should be settled amicably by their respective legislative bodies based on Section 118(d) of the Local Government Code. Pursuant to the decision, Pateros invited Taguig to a council-to-council dialogue on October 8, 2009. Four meetings were held and at the fourth dialogue on November 23, 2009, a joint resolution was made stating that Taguig was requesting a tripartite conference between Pateros, Taguig and Makati.

On August 5, 2013, after a year and a half of deliberations, the 20-year-long battle was decided in a 37-page decision was written by Justice Marlene Gonzales-Sison of the Court of Appeals. The ruling says that jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio has reverted to Makati from Taguig. The court upheld the constitutionality of Presidential Proclamations 2475 and 518, both of which confirmed that portions of the aforementioned military camps are under the jurisdiction of Makati. The decision also cited the fact that voters from the barangays that are subject of the dispute between Makati and Taguig have long been registered as voters of Makati, thus bolstering the former's jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio. Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano, however, maintained that this decision was not yet final and executory, and asked Justice Gonzales-Sison to recuse from the case as it was discovered that her family has close ties with the Binays of Makati.

On August 22, 2013, the Taguig city government filed a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals' Sixth Division affirming its claim on Fort Bonifacio. With the filing of the motion, Taguig asserted jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio. According to Taguig's legal department, jurisprudence, and the rules of procedure in the country's justice system, all say that the filing of a motion for reconsideration suspends the execution of a decision and puts it in limbo. On June 15, 2016, in a 27-page decision by the Second Division of the Supreme Court, the decision found Makati guilty of direct contempt for forum shopping.

On October 3, 2017, the Court of Appeals upheld its final decision in favor of the city government of Taguig and not Makati. The Supreme Court also found Makati guilty of forum shopping after simultaneously appealing the Pasig Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruling and filing a petition before the Court of Appeals, both seeking the same relief. Though Makati, maintained its claim over the disputed area.

In a decision released on April 27, 2022, the Supreme Court upheld the 2011 Pasig RTC ruling that declared that the  Bonifacio Global City complex, along with several surrounding barangays of Makati (Pembo, Comembo, Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo and Pitogo), was under the jurisdiction of the Taguig city government. However, Makati released a statement that it would continue exercising jurisdiction over areas it controlled until it received the official copy of the decision.

Result
In April 2023, the Supreme Court junked the motion for reconsideration that was filed by the city government of Makati to override the court's earlier decision, siding with Taguig. The city government of Taguig released a statement "welcoming the new Taguigeños", referring to the residents of the affected Embo barangays, and that the Taguig LGU will start working on the transition and handover of the Embo barangays.

Makati appeal attempt
Makati Mayor Abby Binay claimed that the dispute is "not yet over", stating that its office has received a notice that the Supreme Court has set its case with Taguig for oral arguments. This was contradicted by high court spokesperson Brian Keith Hosaka who stated that there is no such documents.

Taguig government slams Binay's comment and also expressed belief that her meeting with President Bongbong Marcos, First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos and Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo as a means to "undermine the probity of our highest officials and subvert the people’s trust in the impartiality of justice".

Taguig's mayor seeks sanctions against Makati for the statement.

On June 29, the SC rejected Makati's motion to file a second appeal, saying that it is generally prohibited under their rules. It also said its en banc "is not an appellate court" and will not entertain further pleadings in the case. Makati's had filed an earlier motion for reconsideration which was rejected in 2022.

Aftermath and transition
Taguig issued a statement welcoming ten barangays to its jurisdiction. Makati Mayor Abby Binay conceded defeated after the Supreme Court denied Makati's second appeal.

Taguig would extend its scholarship program to residents of the formerly disputed area.

Mayor Binay on the other hand pledged to continue to provide assistance to residents in the area. She claims that Taguig will not be able to do so immediately noting that its scholarship program has a residency requirement.

Students studying at the University of Makati and residents served by the Ospital ng Makati who are beneficiaries of Makati's social programs would be affected. Taguig claims that Makati should now pay rent for government facilities of Makati now within Taguig.

Makati also suggested holding a plebiscite covering the contested area if both city government agrees.

Taguig proposes the formation of a joint transition body.

In the 8th minute, Riyad Mahrez came forward again down the right, he lifted a good cross in the middle for Sterling, he flicked the header on but couldn't keep it down though and it went just over the bar.

In the 20th minute, Zack Steffen punched a corner away, but Spurs managed to keep hold of it, Harry Winks switched the play out to the left for Son Heung-min, who nodded it down for Toby Alderweireld on the edge of the box, he drilled a low shot to the near post but it was just wide of the target.

In the 30th minute a through ball from Fernandinho took the Spurs defenders out as Sterling ran onto it; Lloris rushed of his line to close him down so Sterling went for the chip but he couldn't get his angles right and it went wide of the far post.

In the 37th minute, City moved it brilliantly on the edge of the box where they played it between Sterling, Foden, De Bruyne, Fernandinho and finally out to Mahrez on the right. He cut inside before firing another shot on goal but this one went just over the crossbar. In the 41st minute, De Bruyne was given too much time on the ball and he took a few touches before curing a lovely cross towards Sterling at the far post, Dier left it and Sterling reached it on the stretch but he couldn't poke it towards goal. In the 45th minute, Aymeric Laporte was booked for bringing Lucas Moura down.

Chi Alpha Sigma, also known as the National College Athlete Honor Society, is an honor society for collegiate student-athletes. Established in 1996, it was the first national society to honor scholar-athletes who excel in both the classroom and athletics.

History
Nick Mourouzis formed the National College Athlete Honor Society at DePauw University in Greencaslte, Indiana on May 17, 1996. Mourouzis was the head football coach and a professor of kinesiology at DePauw. Although there were existing organizations that honored athletics for academic accomplishments, Mourouzis wanted student-athletes who lettered in their sport while also maintaining a high-grade point average. He worked on the legal aspects of such an organization during a sabbatical in 1995.

Mourouzis envisioned an organization to honor student-athletes the way Phi Beta Kappa recognizes scholars. The Greek letters Chi Alpha Sigma were chosen to represent the honor society. He recruited coaches for the society's governing board that represent various levels on competition. The charter board included:

The Alpha chapter was chartered at DePauw University. From there, the honor society expanded to other colleges and universities in Indiana. It then expaned into other states and across the United States.

Symbols 
The honor society's colors are gold and black. Its motto is "Excellence in Athletics and Academics."

Gastrodia spatulata is a species of Gastrodia native to Indonesia and Malaysia. It is known from Borneo and Java.

Taxonomy 
It was first described by Cedric Errol Carr in 1935, from a dried specimen collected in the Penibukan range in Malaysia's Sabah state in 1933, as belonging to a new monotypic genus, and named Neoclemensia spathulata, on the basis of details of the morphology of the flower -it has a shield-shaped stigma on top of a raised protuberance at the base of the column, as opposed to an oblong or broadly V-shaped stigma above the base of the column in the rest of Gastrodia known at the time.

In 2011 Jeffrey James Wood and colleagues, having found it growing on Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, subsumed it into the genus Gastrodia, apparently misspelling the specific epithet as "spatulata" as opposed to "spathulata". This mistake has been rectified by subsequent authors.

Description 
It is morphologically similar to Gastrodia gunatillekeorum, which was discovered in Sri Lanka in 2020.

Distribution
Because, aside from a short flowering time, the species of Gastrodia remain underground throughout their lives, they are extremely cryptic plants and easily overlooked. In 2011 Wood et al. believed the species to be endemic to Mount Kinabalu. The species was first discovered to grow in Indonesia in 2018, when Kenji Suetsugu and colleagues were checking the dried voucher specimens of Gastrodia in the Herbarium Bogoriense, and discovered that one of the specimens of G. javanica which had been collected in western Java was misidentified, and in fact belonged to this species.
Likpalimor Kwajo Tawiah (born 9 September 1960) is a Ghanaian politician and a member of the First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Parliament of the Fourth Republic of Ghana representing the Kpandai constituency in the Northern Region of Ghana.

Early life and education 
Tawiah was born on 9 September 1960 in Nanjuro-Saboba in the Northern Region of Ghana. He attended the University of Education, Winneba and studied to obtain a Bachelor of Education degree in English in 2002. He also attended the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration in 2008. He also had a Teachers' Training Certificate in English at Advance Teacher Training College.

Career 
Prior to becoming a member of parliament, Tawiah worked with the Ghana Education Service as a Tutor at T.I Ahmadiyya Secondary School in Salaga. He was the member of parliament for the Kpandai Constituency in the Northern Region of Ghana from 1993 to 2013. Likpalimor is a former minister of state at the presidency and who had been Principal Superintendent of the Ghana Education Service.

Politics 
Tawiah was first elected into parliament during the 1992 Ghanaian general election on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). During the 1996 election, he polled 18,698 votes out of the 32,508 valid votes cast representing 50.30%. He defeated Konde Paul Evans Dawuni an Independent who obtained 9,729 votes representing 26.20% of the share and Kpajal Kwasi James of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) who obtained 4,081 votes representing 11.00% of the share. He contested again in 2000 and polled 13,368 votes out of the 24,674 valid votes cast representing 54.20%.

He retained his seat again from 2004 to 2012 obtaining 17,233 votes representing 59.61%, and 15,126 votes representing 55.15% respectively. However, he was defeated by Matthew Nyindam in the 2012 Ghanaian general elections who won with 16,221 votes (42.48%) against Tawiah with 13,794 votes (36.12%); Alfred Donkor Odzidzator, an independent with 7,795 votes (20.41%), Bumarck Braimah Friko of the Convention People's Party with 156 votes (0.41%), Mboko Mkrajimamo Yaw of the Progressive People's Party with 154 votes (0.40%), and Aniwaba Kwaku Bediako Jeremiah of the National Democratic Party with 68 votes (0.18%).

In 2011, Likpalimor tackled to be incompetent, giving new idea to improve the living situation of the people in his constituency. Kpandai Constituency has one of the lowest and worst education standards, very high poverty level, high youth unemployment, worst deplorable roads, lack of health facilities and lack of good drinking water in the country. It's pretty obvious; the MP has nothing new to offer to his constituents. He has no plans for constituency and neither has he influenced successive government since 1992 to bring developmental projects to the constituency said Mr Kwadwo Num, A Concerned and Progressive Constituent.

In 2014, he urged E&P firms to be mindful of the environmental impact of oil and gas on plant and animal lives as well as potential conflicts at the Ghana Hosts Peace and Environment Conference. The conference were held by Center for Peace and Environmental Justice (CEPEJ). He said: "I believe you can all join me to confirm the fact that environmental issues have been regarded by many as matters of low politics. As a result, environmental conservation and sustainability have not received much attention across the world."

Personal life 
Tawiah is married with five children. He is a Christian and a member of the Catholic Church.
The Agojo refugee settlement is a refugee camp in the Adjumani District of Northern Uganda, opened in 2016 in response to an influx of South Sudanese refugees fleeing the insecurity in their country. It is located  west of the town of Adjumani.

Education 
Agojo refugee settlement has limited educational opportunities. Refugees pay high tuition fees which many cannot afford, exacerbated by insufficient scholarships and vocational training opportunities. Parents often sell their food rations to supplement school fees.

Water and health 
Agojo refugee settlement has limited water availability, with refugees being able to fill only up two jerry cans per day. The amount of water transported in has decreased, and only one borehole is operational, with no piped water system. This leads refugees to walk long distances to access potable water in the nearby communities where they have to pay or risk tensions with the locals. Moreover, the water is of poor quality.

Access to health services is also limited for both the refugees and the host community, due to the long distance to the health center operating outside the settlement, with refugees traveling up to  to reach the facility.

The Alexandria Library sit-in was one of the first staged sit-in actions in the United States, pioneering the use of nonviolent direct action to demand equal rights for African Americans. On August 21, 1939, five Black men sat down inside the Alexandria Public Library and quietly read books, a transgression of the library's "whites only" policy. Their actions were coordinated by Alexandria attorney Samuel Wilbert Tucker, who planned the action to create a test case challenging the library's racial segregation policy. The men were escorted out of the library by police and charged with disorderly conduct. A ruling was not filed in their court case; in October 2019, all charges against the men were dismissed. The Alexandria sit-in is one of the earliest precursors in the U.S. of the strategies used during the civil rights movement.

Background and planning
The Alexandria Library was built on Queen Street in 1937 on the former Quaker Burial Ground, with the consent of the Society of Friends. It replaced a subscription library located in the former Lee Camp Hall, which had previously housed Confederate veterans. It was built with federal funds from the federal Public Works Administration and labor from the federal Works Progress Administration, as well as money donated by the family of Kate Waller Barrett, which insisted that the City of Alexandria commit to pay its operating expenses. Although funding for the library was provided by taxes paid by everyone in the community, Black people were not permitted to use the library.

Samuel Wilbert Tucker had grown up just two blocks from the site of the Alexandria Library. He received his undergraduate degree from Howard University and, although he didn't attend law school, passed Virginia's bar exam in 1934, at age 20. He was sworn in the following year and began practicing law. He tried for several years to petition the library to provide equal access, but with no success. 

Tucker developed a strategy to use the courts to force the city to allow access: the first step would be to ask for a library card, and the second would be a peaceful sit-in. On March 17, 1939, Tucker and his friend, retired army sergeant George Wilson, visited the library; Wilson filled out an application for a library card, and the librarian refused Wilson's request. Subsequently, Tucker sued on Wilson's behalf, claiming that Wilson's rights had been violated. While the Virginia Public Assemblages Act of 1926 required racial segregation between Black and white people, it did not allow Black people to be barred entirely. Tucker continued his plans by training eight local African American men between the ages of 18 and 22 in how to conduct a nonviolent protest. Five of these young men would take part in the library sit-in, while the other three were kept home by parents fearful of the threat of violence.

Sit-in and immediate aftermath
On August 21, 1939, five well-dressed young Black men entered the Alexandria Library, one by one: William Evans, Edward Gaddis, Morris Murray, Clarence Strange, and Otto L. Tucker (Samuel's brother). They each politely requested a library card, and when each was refused a card by the librarian, each walked to a shelf, grabbed a book, and sat down at a table. They sat at separate tables and did not speak to each other, as Tucker wanted to ensure they took no action that would justify a charge of disorderly conduct. The librarian, Katherine A. Scoggins, ran to the city hall to inform the city manager of what was happening, and he called the police. Tucker called the media, and over 300 spectators watched police escort the five men from the building. Photographers from both white and Black newspapers were also present to record the scene.

The five young men were charged with disorderly conduct, even though all witness testimony was clear that they were well-mannered throughout. Tucker defended them in court, and the judge avoided issuing a ruling. Meanwhile, the judge in the George Wilson case decided that Wilson had not adequately proved that he lived in Alexandria, but that Wilson should apply again and the library would be required to issue him a library card. 

The white Alexandria Library board continued to resist integration, stalling with intense negotiations. The board quickly approved the construction of a "separate but equal" library for African Americans, which opened in April 1940. Most books in the new Robert H. Robinson Library were donated used books or castoffs from the main Alexandria library. Tucker refused an invitation to apply for a library card at this segregated branch, arguing that he should have equal access to the main library.

Later developments
Tucker went on to serve as a lawyer for the NAACP, arguing in groundbreaking civil rights across Virginia and before the U.S. Supreme Court. Virginia continued its massive resistance efforts to enforce segregation; the Alexandria Library was finally integrated to adults in 1959. The Robinson library continued to provide service to Black children until 1962, when they were also allowed to use the main library.

In 2019, research by the library staff showed that the judge had never issued a ruling and charges against the five men were still outstanding. In October 2019, the Alexandria Circuit Court dismissed all charges, ruling that the men were "lawfully exercising their constitutional rights to free assembly, speech and to petition the government to alter the established policy of sanctioned segregation at the time of their arrest" and no charges should have been filed.

Legacy
According to Audrey Davis, director of the Alexandria Black History Museum, the event was "an early crack in the wall of segregation", helping to pave the way for future achievements by African Americans. Library scholar Brenda Mitchell-Powell discusses the significance of choosing a library as a site for civil rights protest, writing it "indicates Tucker's awareness of the centrality of libraries as settings for civic and democratic engagement and empowerment [...] ." Importantly, the sit-in proved that nonviolent protest could be an effective strategy in the fight against segregation.

A 1999 documentary Out of Obscurity: The Story of the 1939 Alexandria Library Sit-In was written and produced by Matt Spangler, including archival interview footage with members of the protest and a dramatization of the sit-in.

After the match, O'Sullivan suggested that Hawkins deserved to win the match: "I feel for Barry, he's been grafting at his game, and he's been unlucky in a few results. He deserved that victory.

Mauree Nivek Rajah Salima Turner (born 1992 or 1993) is an American politician and community organizer. A member of the Democratic Party, they have served as a member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives since 2021. Turner is the first publicly non-binary U.S. state lawmaker and the first Muslim member of the Oklahoma Legislature. They have previously served as a board member of the Council on American–Islamic Relations and led criminal justice reform initiatives with the American Civil Liberties Union.

Early life 
Turner is from Ardmore, Oklahoma and a graduate of Ardmore High School. They are a Muslim, raised in an interfaith Baptist and Muslim household. Their family received public assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and their father spent time in prison. Turner later graduated from Oklahoma State University.

Community organizing 
Turner was a board member of the Council on American–Islamic Relations and led the "Campaigning for Smart Justice" criminal justice reform initiative of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Oklahoma House of Representatives (2021–present)

2020 campaign and first term 
In the 2020 elections, Turner ran as a Democrat for the Oklahoma House of Representatives in district 88, held by incumbent Democrat Jason Dunnington. The district is located in Central Oklahoma City, primarily to the southeast of Interstate 44 and to the west of Interstate 235, containing the campus of Oklahoma City University. Turner's 2020 election campaign was focused on criminal justice reform, public education, and raising the minimum wage. Turner defeated Dunnington in the primary election and was backed by U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar. In the general election, they defeated Kelly Barlean, the Republican nominee, in a landslide, with approximately 71% of the vote. During the general election, Turner was also endorsed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Turner is the first publicly non-binary US state lawmaker and the first Muslim member of the Oklahoma Legislature.

Turner first served in the 58th Oklahoma Legislature. During the 58th legislative session, Turner was an outspoken critic of multiple anti-LGBT bills proposed in the legislature. Specifically, Turner worked against bills that would seek to bar transgender athletes from competing in the sports of their gender. Turner has described the legislature as unwelcoming towards them. They have said, "sometimes, I’m like, 'This does feel like a direct attack on me… I think it is also folks who come into these bodies that aren't prepared to do the real work, but want to legislate from a place of bigotry, or a place of fear." Of the fourteen bills Turner filed in the first session, none were given a committee hearing by the Republican-led Oklahoma House of Representatives.

Re-election campaign and second term 
Turner was reelected in the 2022 elections to serve in the 59th Oklahoma Legislature. In 2023, the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma issued a statement criticizing the Oklahoma House of Representatives  for tabling Turner's proposed amendments to the chamber's dress code rules that would have made the rules gender neutral.

House censure 
On February 28, 2023 the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed H.B. 2177; the bill would ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender children. During protests that day, a protestor allegedly tossed water on Representative Bob Ed Culver Jr. and had a physical interaction with a police officer. After the altercation, the protestor was locked in Turner's office; The Oklahoma Highway Patrol alleged Turner refused to unlock the office when they communicated with them through the door. On March 7, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma House voted along party lines to censure Representative Turner. They were also removed from their committee assignments until a written apology is sent to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and Speaker Charles McCall. Turner denied wrongdoing saying “I just provide my office as space of grace and love for all the folks in all communities that seek refuge from the hate in this building... Trans people don't feel safe here.” They also declined to apologize, stating "I think an apology for loving the people of Oklahoma is something that I cannot do.” Oklahoma House Democrats criticized the censure because no investigation was done before the censure, Turner had not committed a crime, and because multiple members of the Republican majority that were facing indictment had yet to be censured. The New York Times compared Turner's censure to the Montana House of Representatives censure of Zooey Zephyr, another transgender state lawmaker, who was censured for giving a speech in the Montana chamber for saying supporters of an anti-transgender health bill had "blood on [their] hands" for voting for a bill "tantamount to torture."

Personal life 
Turner is a queer and non-binary femme, and uses they/them pronouns.
They were endorsed in their 2022 re-election campaign by the Oklahoma City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Vorau Abbey is an abbey of the Austrian Congregation of Canons Regular located in Vorau, Styria, Austria. Founded in 1163, it contains an ornate Viennese High Baroque collegiate church and library that date to the 18th century.

History 
Vorau Abbey was founded in 1163 by Margrave Ottokar III of Styria as an act of gratitude for the birth of his son, Ottokar IV. He donated lands to the Archbishop of Salzburg, Eberhard I, who oversaw the abbey's construction. The Austrian Congregation of Canons Regular took up residence upon its completion.

The territory in which the abbey is located was the subject of frequent invasion by neighboring countries. Therefore, the abbey was walled in 1458 and many defensive features were built, including towers, a moat and iron bars at the entrance. With 15 towers, the abbey has more than any other monastery in Austria. With such defenses, the residents of Vorau often sought refuge inside the monastery during time of invasion.

The abbey's first collegiate church was built in the Romanesque style, following a fire in 1237. The church was later redesigned in the Gothic style. It was again rebuilt from 1660 to 1662, designed by Swiss architect . In 1700, the church was finally redesigned by Matthias Steinl in the Viennese High Baroque style. Its high altar was built from 1701 to 1704, while the pulpit dates to 1706. The sacristy is decorated with frescoes by , the abbey's resident painter, who created them in 1715 and 1716. Writing in the New Catholic Encyclopedia, local librarian and archivist Pius Fank described the church as the "most splendid baroque church in Styria."

The abbey's library was built in 1731. It contains 40,000 books, 206 incunabula, and 416 manuscripts, as well as the oldest collection of Middle High German poems.

In April 1940, the Nazi government commandeered the abbey, expelling its canons. It was subject to heavy bombardment during World War II. Half of the abbey was destroyed in 1945, though the majority of destruction was confined to outlying farm buildings; the main building, including the church, was largely spared. The abbey's library was significantly damaged during the war, and about 5,000 books were stolen. The canons returned to the monastery after the end of the war in 1945.

The complex remains an active abbey. Parts of it are also used as a school, tavern, and private residences.

"Turn Left at Mount Everest" was an American television play broadcast on April 3, 1958, as part of the second season of the CBS television series Playhouse 90. Del Reisman wrote the teleplay, as an adaptation of a stage play by Lowell Barrington. Peter Lorre and Fess Parker starred.

Plot
A comedy in which Private Linus Powell (Fess Parker) stows away on a B-17 flying from China across the Himalayas at the end of World War II to reunite with his British girlfriend in Calcutta. While Powell sleeps, the crew bails out in a monsoon, and Powell is left behind with a half-loaded Asian man played by Peter Lorre, who tries to guide Powell over the Himalayas.

Reception
Television critic William Ewald described it as "a pretty peculiar stab" at light comedy. While he found some scenes that "almost made it", he concluded that the production "as a whole ... didn't have it. Its situation and characters were only mildly amusing and its dialogue lacked sustained spark."

Critic Hope Strong wrote that the production aspired to be "deliciously droll" but ended up with "drizzly drivel."

Another critic, Fred Remington, was amused by the production, writing that Fess Parker "just plays himself, and a very agreeable, entertaining self it is."

Lucio Luiz (born Rio de Janeiro, July 14, 1978) is a Brazilian journalist, writer, editor, podcaster and comics author. He holds a degree in Journalism and has Master's degree and Doctorate in Education.

Biography

Fan fiction 

From 2002, Lucio started writing fan fiction (mainly about the characters Lobo and Fire, from DC Comics) on the Hyperfan website, then one of the main Brazilian websites dedicated to fanfics. In 2006, already as editor-in-chief of the site, he organized the book Hyperfan: cinco anos de fanfic (Hyperfan: five years of fanfic) in honor of the site's anniversary, which brought unpublished stories created by its members, as well as illustrations by the comics artist JJ Marreiro.

The short stories were set in a new fictional universe, created by the authors, in which ordinary people gain superpowers thanks to a mysterious phenomenon. This book is considered the first Brazilian fiction book dedicated to the superhero genre.

In addition to being responsible for editing and organizing the book, Lucio wrote the humorous short story "Super tia" (Super aunt), about a kindergarten teacher who began to mentally control her students with tragicomic results.

Academic research 

Between 2007 and 2009, Lucio took a Masters in Education at Estácio de Sá University, developing a dissertation on the impact of the creation of fan fiction by teachers and students in relation to school written production and digital literacy. From that time on, he began to regularly publish academic research at various conferences in the areas of Communication and Education, and he was also one of the first Brazilian researchers to study and write academic articles on participatory culture.

At that time, there was not yet a consecrated translation in Brazil for the term "participatory culture", with Lucio suggesting the use of "cultura participatória" as it is closer to the original intention of Henry Jenkins, creator of the term. However, as more research was carried out, the translation "cultura participativa" ended up becoming the most used in Portuguese.

In 2018, Lucio completed his Doctorate in Education at Estácio de Sá University, defending a thesis on the perception of Basic education teachers on the use of comics in the classroom. In 2021, this thesis was published in the book Professores Protagonistas: os quadrinhos em sala de aula na visão dos docentes (Protagonist Teachers: comics in the classroom in the view of educators).

Meninos e Dragões 

In 2012, Lucio created, in co-authorship with artist Flavio Soares, the children's comic book series Meninos & Dragões, which won the 2nd Prêmio Abril de Personagens (Abril Characters Award) and was released as a regular comic book by Editora Abril the following year.

However, due to the crisis that Editora Abril was going through at the time, which was resulting in several cuts in publications, especially comics, the comic book was canceled after the publication of the first issue. Still, the comic won the Prêmio Angelo Agostini for Best Release in 2014.

The series Meninos e Dragões was published again in 2018, when Lucio and Flavio re-released it in the format of albums with unique stories and with the characters' look completely reformulated. The first volume was nominated for the Troféu HQ Mix for Best Children's Publication the following year.

Publishing house 

In 2013, Lucio founded the independent publishing house Marsupial Editora, focused on books in the areas of Education, Communication and Technology. The following year, he created the Jupati Books imprint, intended for the publication of comics, being responsible for editing several collections and graphic novels.

The publisher's first book was Os Quadrinhos na Era Digital: HQtrônicas, webcomics e cultura participativa (Comics in the Digital Age: "comictronics", webcomics and participatory culture), a theoretical book organized by Lucio with texts, among others, by researchers Octavio Aragão, Edgar Franco, Roberto Elísio dos Santos, Henrique Magalhães and Paulo Ramos, in addition to Lucio himself. This book was nominated for the Troféu HQ Mix for Best Theoretical Book in 2014.

In addition, Lucio has also written children's books such as A Mamãe Tamanduá, with illustrations by PriWi, and Palavras, Palabras, with illustrations by Bianca Pinheiro.

Comics 

Lucio created, in 2009, the comic strip As Aventuras do MorsaMan with Flavio Soares. The comic presented short stories of the character MorsaMan, "mascot" of the health and entertainment website Papo de Gordo, in which both participated as podcasters and writers.

In addition to writing the series Meninos e Dragões, Lucio also published comics in collections such as Feitiço da Vila, with stories inspired by the songs of Noel Rosa (he wrote two stories, illustrated respectively by Mario Cau and Lu Cafaggi), and Café Espacial #13, with a story drawn by Flavio Soares, among other works.

In 2020, Lucio was a juror for the Prêmio Jabuti in the “Comic Book" category, alongside Germana Viana and Marcelo D'Salete. The judges were chosen by the award's board of curators after a public consultation.

In July 2022, Lucio published on the platform Webtoon the webcomic 4th Wall Brawl, written by him and with pencils by Flávio Luiz, ink by Flavio Soares and colors by Will Rez and Marco Pelandra.

Sorin Lavric (born 27 November 1967 in Turnu Severin, Socialist Republic of Romania) is a Romanian writer, philosopher and politician. Having started studying medicine in 1987, Lavric later began studying philosophy as well. Posteriorly, as he did not want to be a physician, he focused entirely on philosophy. Lavric finished his university studies in 1996 and obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 2005. Lavric has written several books.

He has made in the past numerous comments that have been deemed as racist, homophobic and misogynistic that have provoked his expulsion from the Writers' Union of Romania. Despite this, he has affirmed that he is not a misogynist. Lavric eventually became a politician "to confront the corruption and political class of Romania". He joined the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), of which he is the President of the Senate. Lavric was also the proposed senator of the AUR for the Neamț County.

Biography
Sorin Lavric was born in 1967 in Turnu Severin, Romania. He studied medicine at the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy between 1987 and 1993. The following year, he did an internship at the Brăila County Hospital, which included 3 months of gynecology. However, in 1990, he also started studying philosophy and joined in 1991 at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Bucharest. According to him, he only studied medicine because at that time (1987), during the communist period of Romania, it was not worth studying philosophy.

After his internship, Lavric realized he disliked medicine and had to choose between becoming a physician and not being able to aspire to be a philosopher or giving up medicine. Lavric chose the latter option and had to be supported by his wife for 2 years. He completed his studies on 1996 and was offered in 1997 a job as an editor at the publishing house Humanitas by the Romanian philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu. In 2005, he obtained a doctorate in philosophy. Liiceanu, who was coordinator in Lavric's thesis for the doctorate, has expressed surprise at his posterior controversial comments, saying that it is as if Lavric had undergone "a personality substitution operation", "as in science fiction movies".

Lavric has written several books, such as Cartea de Craciun ("Christmas Book", 1997), Ontologia lui Noica. O exegeza ("Noica's ontology. An exegesis", 2005) and Noica și Mișcarea Legionară ("Noica and the Legionary Movement", 2007). He has also done several translations.

Ideology and political career
Lavric has made several comments characterized as racist, homophobic and misogynistic; these have given him a certain notoriety in the past. In his book Decoct de femeie ("Decoction of women"), he wrote that "no man seeks in women cleverness, depth, or lucidity". He has also described the Roma people (Gypsies) as a "social plague". In an interview, Lavric denied being a misogynist and explained his thoughts and declarations, stating that "I cannot say that a woman excels in logical thinking, especially in philosophical skills". Furthermore, Lavric has admitted being a misanthrope.

Because of his comments, the Writers' Union of Romania expelled him from the association and from the position of editor in the magazine România literară. In the same interview, which was posterior to this event, Lavric said he was surprised when he heard about this as it was not directly communicated to him and that he felt "hit" by his own teammates. He added that he did not feel resentful for this.

Lavric joined the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) because, according to him, he was against the corrupt attitudes of the political class and because he coincided with the thoughts of George Simion and Claudiu Târziu, then the co-presidents of the AUR. He also stated that he was pro-European and supported NATO, but opposed a European "federal superstate run [...] from Brussels". In an interview with Simion and Târziu, they said that Lavric (and the AUR) did not hate women or support misogynistic ideas. Lavric was the proposed senator of the AUR for the Neamț County in 2020. Currently, he is the President of the Senate of the AUR.

Irene Akua Agyepong is a Ghanaian public health physician with the Dodowa Health Research Center and member of the Faculty of Public Health of the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons. Agyepong led The Lancet commission on the future of healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa.

Early life and education 
As a child, Ageypong wanted to write, sew and become a doctor. She eventually studied medicine at the University of Ghana Medical School. She moved to the West African College of Physicians, where she was encouraged by her aunt, Phyllis Antwi, to specialise in public health. After graduating Ageypong worked as a medical locum at a mission hospital. One of her first positions was working in obstetrics; which she found emotionally challenging. In an interview with The Lancet Agyepong explained, “This was Ghana in the 1980s—we were still emerging from a really difficult economic time. Sometimes there were no gloves, there weren't the right needles, sometimes you couldn't find simple things like a scalpel…And there was no blood bank…You could have somebody die before enough blood became available. You would know what to do—but couldn't”. She was encouraged by then Director of Medical Services Moses Adibo to work internationally, and moved to the United Kingdom to study public health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Agyepong eventually moved to the United States, where she completed a doctoral degree studying malaria control in Ghana.

The 90th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, (90th LAA Rgt) was an air defence unit of the British Army during World War II. Initially raised as an infantry battalion of the South Wales Borderers in 1940, it transferred to the Royal Artillery in 1941. It served with 1st Infantry Division in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign, distinguished itself in the Anzio landings and subsequent fighting, and continued serving in Italy before being disbanded at the beginning of 1945.

7th Battalion, South Wales Borderers

The unit was originally formed in May 1940 as 50th Holding Battalion, South Wales Borderers, as part of the rapid expansion of the Army with wartime conscripts. It converted to a normal infantry battalion on 9 October that year as 7th Battalion, South Wales Borderers.

On 10 October it joined 224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) which was being organised in South Wales. From 19 February 1941 the brigade was temporarily attached to 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, at that time serving in X Corps in the invasion-threatened south-east corner of Kent.  On 12 March it joined the Durham and North Riding County Division when that static defence formation was formed along the coast of North East England.

90th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment

7th South Wales Borderers left 224th Bde on 15 November 1941 and transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) to begin retraining in the light anti-aircraft (LAA) role, becoming 90th LAA Regiment with Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) and 311, 312 and 313 LAA Batteries. Surplus men were drafted on 26 November to 211th Heavy AA Training Regiment at Oswestry where they joined a new 493 (Mixed) Heavy AA Bty that was being formed for 141st (Mixed) HAA Rgt ('Mixed' indicating that women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated into the unit's personnel).

After initial training, 90th LAA Rgt joined Anti-Aircraft Command in December, but left before it had been assigned to a brigade. The regiment joined 1st Infantry Division on 27 January 1942, and remained with that formation for the rest of its existence. At the time, 1st Division was in II Corps District in East Anglia.

In October the division was transferred to I Corps (known as Force 152 at the time). On 6 February 1943 it came under direct War Office control preparatory to going on overseas service, and on 28 February it sailed for North Africa.

Tunisia
1st Division landed between 5 and 9 March, and between 3 and 6 April it joined First Army fighting in Tunisia. It went into the line as part of V Corps facing Longstop Hill, which had proved unassailable as far back as 22 December. Much of the divisional LAA was used to protect the field gun positions. In the rough country of Tunisia the forward LAA units were often involved in  'snap' engagements against fast, low-flying air attacks. Increasingly, they discarded the LAA No 3 Kerrison Predictor and employed the simple 'Stiffkey Stick' deflection sight for the Bofors.

First Army was preparing for its final assault on Tunis (Operation Vulcan), but early on the morning of 21 April the Germans launched a spoiling attack against 1st Division's 3rd Brigade on 'Banana Ridge', which posed some danger to the artillery that was assembling well forward for the forthcoming attack. The spoiling attack was driven off after some stiff fighting. On 23 April 1st Division launched its attack against a line of low hills, with considerable artillery support, but found the captured ground too hard to dig in, and was thrown back by counter-attacks. The ridge was taken again next day and securely held, at the cost of high casualties. The division had some sharp actions over the succeeding days but by 5 May it was in place for Operation Strike. That evening it took Djebel Bou Aoukaz with massive artillery support, securing the flank for First Army's main attack early next morning. British troops entered Tunis next day, and the Axis forces in Tunisia surrendered on 12 May.

As a prelude to the Allied invasion of Sicily, 1st Division was landed on Pantelleria on 11 June in Operation Corkscrew. Pantelleria was rumoured to be an island fortress, but after  massive air and naval bombardment, the garrison surrendered without any land fighting. There were some subsequent air attacks from Sicily, but a number of British AA units had been landed with radar to defend the captured island, and 1st Division was soon back in North Africa.

Italy
The division sailed again on 4 December, landing on mainland Italy next day to enter the Italian Campaign. Initially it joined British Eighth Army but was soon shifted west to reinforce the Fifth US Army for the Allied assault landing at Anzio (Operation Shingle). The division concentrated at Pompeii, Nola and Salerno under strict secrecy between 1 and 5 January 1944.

At this stage of the war one 6-gun Troop in each LAA battery was equipped with self-propelled (SP) Bofors guns, the other two being towed. However, for this landing 90th LAA Rgt concentrated all 18 of its SP Bofors in 312 LAA Bty to land with the first wave on 'Peter' Beach on 21 January 1944. Apart from the SP guns, only Jeeps and ammunition trucks could be taken. 311 LAA Battery with towed Bofors landed next day (D + 1) and the two batteries, having lost one gun, moved inland to defend the field artillery positions. At first all went well, but the commander of the operation waited too long to build up his forces and lost the initiative. The Germans quickly contained the beachhead and by 1 February were attempting to drive the Allied troops back towards the sea, and sending over waves of air attacks. 313 LAA Battery had been landed on D + 5, and two other LAA batteries (168 Bty from 56th (East Lancashire) LAA Rgt and one from 100th LAA Rgt) also arrived, but the five batteries had to cover the spread of six field artillery regiments, which were unable to disperse or find cover in the congested beachhead.

Most of the AA effort at Anzio was controlled by 35th US AA Artillery Brigade, but the radar of its single mobile operations room was having trouble giving early warning of attacks by low-flying Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 single-seat fighter-bombers. 90th LAA Regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.S. Turner, tasked with coordinating the AA cover of the British sector, asked for help and got some mobile No 4 Mark III lightweight local warning radar sets sent from 22nd AA Bde back at Salerno. All his batteries prepared concentrations of fire within their sectors, for use by day or night to cover the front. The guns fired on fixed bearings at an elevation of 35 degrees, employing 12-second long-burning Tracer ammunition: 'this produced a curtain of bursts at about  with sheets of tracer behind it'. These concentrations could be ordered by the gun operations room, by radio, or by a 'master gun' on watch in each troop. By 19 February Turner was reinforced by the other two batteries of 100th LAA Rgt to extend the fire plan, one of which was stationed aboard Landing Ship, Tank, vessels moored in Anzio harbour.

In the flat, open country of the beachhead, the LAA positions were dangerously  conspicuous and were frequently shelled and mortared. During February 90th LAA Rgt lost 17 men killed and 53 wounded. Although the battered infantry of 1st Division were rotated, 90th LAA remained in action. Raids continued all through March, in strengths varying from single aircraft to 20-plus, while the grim fighting along the front often drew in the LAA troops to give fire support to the infantry. 35th AAA Brigade claimed that by 25 March the number of aircraft shot down by all AA units at Anzio amounted to 141. Although the tempo of air attacks declined in April, the calls for support from the infantry engaged in Trench warfare were endless. On 21 April alone, 90th LAA Rgt fired 3425 rounds against German infantry working their way up dry river beds into the Allied positions. Other targets included enemy forming-up areas, buildings containing machine-guns, and enemy positions along railway embarkments, The LAA batteries used the observation posts (OPs) of the field artillery or set up their own. 312 LAA Battery alone fired  over 12,000 rounds against such targets. 90th LAA Regiment receives special praise from the Royal Artillery historian for remaining in action from the first day to the last of the Anzio campaign. Its AA score in four months of action was 113 Category 1 'kills', of which only seven were due to concentrations, the remainder to individual shooting. Luftwaffe casualties were so heavy that it stopped daylight raids over the beachhead in May and concentrated on night bombing of  the port and beaches, which were protected by the heavy AA guns of 35th AAA Bde.

When the Allies broke out of the Anzio beachhead on 23 May, the exhausted 1st Division was left as a holding unit under Fifth US Army. By 3 June it was pushing forward again as a flank guard as Fifth Army drove on. It met some resistance but reached the River Tiber on 5 June, the day after Rome fell. It then left for rest and refit in Army Group Reserve.

1st Division returned to the front line under XIII Corps near Florence on 8/9 August. It. crossed the River Arno on 21 August as a preliminary to Operation Olive to break the Germans' Gothic Line. In early September the division was following the retreating Germans and by 15 September it was approaching the Casaglia Pass. The Luftwaffe rarely appeared. However, by mid-October the offensive had begun to lose impetus in the Apennine Mountains as the Allied supply lines were stretched and the difficulty of finding suitable gun positions increased. 1st Division was exhausted and could not continue to attack in the winter conditions. The offensive was closed down on 26 October.

Disbandment
By late 1944 the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious air attacks were rare. At the same time British forces in Italy were suffering an acute manpower shortage. As early as June 1944 the Chiefs of Staff had decided that the number of AA regiments in Italy must be reduced and their fit personnel converted to other roles, particularly infantry. 90th LAA Regiment was one of those selected for disbandment: it was withdrawn from the front on 7 November and replaced in 1st Division by 11th (City of London Yeomanry) LAA Rgt. (11th (CoLY) LAA Regiment only deployed one Bofors battery in AA defence of bridges while the rest of the regiment served in a variety of support roles.)

90th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment was formally disbanded on 8 January 1945. Many of the men would have been sent to the Infantry Reinforcement Training Depot. In the case of retrained AA gunners, care was taken to post them to infantry battalions from their home areas, though there were few Welsh battalions in the Mediterranean theatre.
Alien Fashion Show is an American swing revival band, formed in Los Angeles in 1996. After being invited to perform as Brian Setzer's opening act during his Fall 1998 tour, the group signed to Surfdog, then Hollywood Records, and released their eponymous debut album in 1998. Also in 1998, the group drew attention when "Detroit Swing City" became the first-ever song to be released by a major record label as a free MP3 download. Reaction to this new method was generally mixed, but both the group and the label defended the approach, and other labels began adopting the release medium as well. 

The group's music went into rotation on multiple alternative and college radio stations around the United States, and they toured through 1999. In 2011, they self-released their second studio album, Cool Thing, and in 2019 released an EP titled Hellsville. Their work was also featured on multiple labels' swing revival compilations in the late 1990s.

History
The group was formed in Los Angeles in 1996 by Eldon Daetweiler, a singer and trumpeter; Daetweiler's brother Jeff, a drummer; Todd Thurman, a guitarist; Jeffrey Allen, a bassist and childhood friend of the Daetweilers; Steve "Shaman" Steinberg, original bassist, and Kenji "Woodchuck" Saito, a keyboardist. The Daetweilers had listened to music by Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Dorsey, and Glenn Miller as children, and been inspired by them to begin playing the trumpet and drums. Prior to forming the group, all had performed extensively in the LA club scene. 

Rockabilly and swing revival musician Brian Setzer heard some of the group's early recordings and invited them to perform as the opening act for his Fall 1998 tour. Setzer's manager subsequently signed them to Surfdog Records for the release of their debut full-length studio album. They recorded their debut album at two California studios: 4th Street Recording, in Santa Monica, and Village Recorder, in Los Angeles. Their eponymous debut album was released later that year, on July 28, 1998, and re-released by Hollywood Records. 

One of the tracks on the debut, "Detroit Swing City", was a swing-styled cover of the Kiss song "Detroit Rock City". On July 23, five days before the release of its parent album, Hollywood Records announced that it would be releasing the track for free online as a downloadable MP3 file. This made "Detroit Swing City" the first-ever song to be released in such a format by a major record label. Executives at the label expressed hope that the song's release would help to spread the band's name and boost sales of the album and concert tickets, especially given that they had no intention of formally releasing the song as a commercial single. The group shared these expectations, with Jeff Daetweiler arguing that "if they hear the single, people will hopefully buy the album. I think it has been a boon for us, really, rather than a hindrance. And I hope the rest of the industry starts to realize that." Hollywood Records' General Manager told Billboard at the end of 1998 that this decision drew criticism from some who were skeptical of the new format; however, in the following months, other major-label artists also began releasing their music as free MP3 files. The song had been downloaded more than 40,000 times by the summer of 1999. 

By February 1999, the group was also in rotation on some American college radio and alternative rock stations, including Maryville, Missouri's KDLX; Fort Lauderdale, Florida's WNSU; Jacksonville, Florida's WFIN; Rochester, New York's WIRQ; Sanborn, New York's WNCB; and St. Louis's KNSX. In 1999, the group performed with rock bands including the Goo Goo Dolls, and co-headlined the 25-date Freschetta Mirror Ball Tour in Spring of that year.

The group reunited in 2011 to release Cool Thing, a studio album consisting of re-recorded tracks from their 1998 debut in addition to some new material. In 2019, the group released an extended play, titled Hellsville; it was recorded at 4th Street Recording, the same Santa Monica studio at which they had recorded part of their debut album.

Musical style
Lead singer Eldon Daetweiler has stated that the group did not aim to be a "quote swing band", and that their objective was instead to imagine "What if Frank Sinatra grew up in the town of Twin Peaks or hung out with David Bowie?" Although classified as a swing band, the group has also been noted for the many other stylistic influences which they incorporate into their music, including surf, rockabilly, and trip-hop.

Personal lives 
It was reported that Eldon and Jeff Daetweiler lived together and hung a psychedelic portrait of Gene Krupa in their living room. In December 1997, Billboard reported that lead guitarist Todd Thurman and his wife, events marketing coordinator Judyth Springer-Thurman, had had a daughter, named Genevieve Dorothy. AFS Bassist Jeffrey Alan Dick passed away July 22, 2020.

The Man On The Other Side is a 2019 Singapore-German spy film, written and directed by Marcus Lim and produced by Lim and Thomas Hillenbrand. The film is Lim's debut feature film and was the first theatrical co-production between the two countries.

An espionage thriller, set in 1970s Cold War Germany, the film explores the phenomenon of Romeo agents, East German spies sent to  seduce and compromise West German women in vulnerable political appointments.

The film won the Festival Prize for Best Feature Film at the 2019 Montevideo World Film Festival, and had a limited theatrical release in Singapore in 2021.

Plot 
In 1974, Sophie Zimmermann is a meek, bespectacled woman in her late-30s, working for the West German Federal Ministry of Defence in Bonn. For six months, she has been copying top secret government documents. Following a tense interrogation by a superior officer, she makes a run for the border. On the day of the escape, however, she is captured by a mysterious, unknown assailant.

Sophie wakes up in a dimly lit cellar, drugged and tied. While trying to break free of her restraints, she remembers her first meeting with Dieter Shaeffer, a smooth talking young salesman who captured her heart, and set her on the path of stealing top secret documents.

As she tries to find her way out of this makeshift prison, she discovers a young Englishman imprisoned in an inner room. Sophie is told that she has been captured by the Stasi, and that they are deep in East Germany. Her boyfriend, it seems, has betrayed her.

As Sophie and the Englishman plot to escape, they bond together in their shared suffering. She reveals to him, the government secrets that she had shared with Dieter, while he tells her of his unsuccessful, desperate solo attempt at smuggling his Russian girlfriend to the safety of the West.

It turns out that her captor is in fact, the Englishman, who is an MI6 agent. They are in fact, not in East Germany, but in a safe house somewhere in rural North Rhine-Westphalia, in West Germany.

Because of conditions in the federal constitution, BND intelligence agents are not allowed to torture and kill West German citizens. Instead, they have contracted the MI6 agent to find out exactly how much she knew, and what information she passed on to the Stasi, which includes information on the number of nuclear missiles placed in West Germany by the Americans.

Sophie escapes, and is chased throughout the darkened and abandoned hotel. She manages to lock the Englishman in another cell, and finds Dieter, tortured and near death. Sharing Dieter's last breaths, a grieving Sophie, walks out of the hotel and into a new life, leaving the Englishman locked up to a slow and lonely death.

The series follows the guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus resort chain. In the episode, Shane and Rachel are visited by his mother, Kitty, causing problems. Meanwhile, Armond faces a new dilemma.

According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.515 million household viewers and gained a 0.1 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the writing, character development and performances.

Plot
Paula (Brittany O'Grady) to a room, where she sees her having sex with Kai (Kekoa Scott Kekumano) watch the sunrise at the beach, just as Kai explains more about the culture of the Native Hawaiians. She returns to her room, which concerns Olivia (Sydney Sweeney). Nicole (Connie Britton) also questions Mark (Steve Zahn) for his disappearance and state.

Armond (Murray Bartlett) confesses to Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) about his relapse, and she calms him down. Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) informs Olivia and Paula that she found their bag and sent her to Armond, so they demand it back. As he goes to retrieve it, he is confronted once again by Shane (Jake Lacy), who demands to talk to his boss. Angered, he decides to take the drugs and return the bag to Olivia and Paula. Shane's mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon), surprises him by showing up. While Shane is delighted, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario) is not pleased as she interrupts their honeymoon. Tanya also informs Belinda that she has to cancel their appointment to discuss the wellness business, as she is planning to go out with a sport fisherman named Greg (Jon Gries).

That night, Olivia "meets" Kai for the first time, not revealing that she is Paula's friend, while Quinn (Fred Hechinger) unwittingly reveals that Mark cheated on Nicole from an earlier confession. Kitty dismisses Rachel's goals and suggests taking a different route, which embarrasses her. Tanya dines with Greg, believing he is a Black Lives Matter activist. However, Greg reveals that the BLM acronym was different, he actually works at the Bureau of Land Management. After their dinner, they have sex. Armond invites Dillon (Lukas Gage) to his office, where they choose to use drugs and have sex. During this, Shane tries to contact Armond's boss, only to discover that he gave him a fake number. He leaves his discussion with Rachel to confront Armond at his office. Belinda guides him to Armond's office, where they are both shocked to find him performing anilingus on Dillon. As Armond laments his situation, Shane laughs and walks away, proclaiming to take him down.

Production

Development
In June 2021, HBO announced that the fourth episode of the season would be titled "Recentering", and that it would be written and directed by series creator Mike White. This was White's fourth writing and directorial credit for the series.

Reception

Viewers
In its original American broadcast, "Recentering" was seen by an estimated 0.515 million household viewers with a 0.1 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.1 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a slight increase from the previous episode, which was watched by 0.478 million household viewers with a 0.1 in the 18-49 demographics.

Critical reviews
"Recentering" received generally positive reviews from critics. Roxana Hadadi of The A.V. Club gave the episode an "A–" grade and wrote, "Even as 'Recentering' finally acknowledges the Hawaiian perspective, sketches out the sympathetic Paula, and tumbles Armond further into self-destructive debauchery, Mike White's insistence that our identities are generationally cyclical looms large."

Amanda Whiting of Vulture gave the episode a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, "The White Lotus has been circling the possibility that it's a show with something to say, but this week, Mike White finally lands the plane (sort of). The rich, white hotel guests — smiling, damaged — are each presented a chance to show what they're about. One by one, they arrive at the same answer: themselves. Still, as a series, The White Lotus is more curious about the deficiencies of its privileged characters than in getting to know the characters who wait on them." 

Alex Noble of TheWrap wrote, "If you've been keeping up with The White Lotus, then you've probably noticed that the show, written and directed by Mike White, is far more concerned with the social satire than the murder it keeps teasing us with. If that's an itch you need scratched, there is plenty of other HBO Max programming for you. But personally, I'm loving the show’s approach. Still, now that we're past the series halfway mark, I can't help but wonder if the emphasis on the character dynamics is intended to distract us from some killer in plain sight." Breeze Riley of Telltale TV gave the episode a 3.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, "Hopefully, The White Lotus continues to build on the ideas brought up on this episode instead of relying on the same self-absorbed drama of its increasingly predictable characters."

Accolades

For the episode, Murray Bartlett won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie  at the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards.
The Turkish Basketball Championship was a top-level basketball championship competition in Turkey, that was run by the Turkish Basketball Federation, from 1946 to 1967. In the 1966–67 season, the competition was replaced by the Turkish Basketball Super League (BSL).

The Basketball Super League (BSL), also known as the ING Basketbol Süper Ligi for sponsorship reasons, is the top men's professional basketball division of the Turkish basketball league system. It replaced the former Turkish Basketball Championship (1946–1967) to become the Turkish Basketball League (TBL) until 2015 when it adopted its current name while the TBL name became exclusive to the second-tier and third-tier divisions.

Performance by club
Clubs in bold currently play in the top division.

1955 two domestic champions
On April 25, 1955, the last game of the championship was Fenerbahçe against Galatasaray at Spor Sergi Sarayı. Galatasaray and Modaspor were in the championship race until the last game and they had the same number of points. Therefore, the last game was very important for both Galatasaray and Modaspor since the champion would be determined by total point difference. In the game against Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe officials withdrew their team from the match with just 44 seconds left to the end of the match due to Fenerbahçe being behind by 13 points, with no chance of turning the game. Thus the match could not be concluded. Nevertheless, the Federation of Sports declared that such behavior of the Fenerbahçe officials would not be acceptable and there were two domestic champions, Galatasaray and Modaspor, in that year. The trophy was split into two pieces and both clubs could keep these in their museums.

1967 Turkish Basketball Championship

Release history
Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World (1966) is a book by Barrington Moore Jr.

The work studied the roots of democratic, fascist and communist regimes in different societies, looking especially at the ways in which industrialization and the pre-existing agrarian regimes interacted to produce those different political outcomes. He drew particular attention to the violence which preceded the development of democratic institutions.

Initially, Moore set out to study a large number of countries, but reduced his number of cases to eight. The book took more than ten years to write.

It is a cornerstone to  comparative historical analysis in social science.

Overall argument
Moore's concern was the transformation of pre-industrial agrarian social relations into "modern" ones. He highlighted what he called "three routes to the modern world" - the liberal democratic, the fascist, and the communist - each deriving from the timing of industrialization and the social structure at the time of transition.

The route to democracy
In the simplest sense, Social Origins can be summarized with his famous dictum, "No bourgeois, no democracy".

However, Moore lists five conditions for the development of Western-style democracy (through a "bourgeois revolution"):
 the "development of a balance to avoid too strong a crown or too independent a landed aristocracy"
 a shift toward "an appropriate form of commercial agriculture"
 a "weakening of the landed aristocracy"
 the "prevention of an aristocratic-bourgeois coalition against the peasants and workers" [which would lead to fascism]
 a "revolutionary break with the past".

 In England, the effect of the "bourgeois impulse" was to change the attitudes of a portion of the landed elite towards commercial farming, leading to the destruction of the peasantry through the enclosure system and the English Civil War which led to an aristocratic, but moderate democracy.
 In France, the French Revolution did directly include the bourgeoisie, but it was the overwhelming influence of the peasantry that determined "just how far it could go." The peasantry remained thereafter a reservoir of reactionary attitudes.
 In the United States, the industrial north's victory over the Southern planter elite in the Civil War cemented the U.S. path to modernity through liberal democracy, but only after southern planters "acquired a tincture" of urban business - essentially changing their attitudes towards capitalist accumulation. The result, however, was that once this transformation took place, the Northern capitalists ended Reconstruction and allowed the South to implement Jim Crow.

Routes to dictatorship
Moore also directly addressed the Japanese transition to modernity through fascism and the communist path in China, while implicitly remarking on Germany and Russia.
 For Moore, the influence of the bourgeoisie in Japan was significantly more limited than in England, France, and the U.S. Instead of the capitalist accumulation through the "bourgeois impulse" as it did in those three cases, Japan's late transition to industrial modernity was induced through "labor repressive" agriculture — squeezing the peasantry to generate the necessary capital for modernization. This "revolution from above" served to cement a reactionary alliance of a weak bourgeoisie and powerful landowners that culminated in fascism. 
In China, the overwhelming strength of the peasantry vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie and the landed elites resulted in the Chinese Revolution, but they were its first victims.  Here, the bourgeoisie allied with the peasants, and created a "revolution from below."  Moore criticized attempts by other sociologists to retroactively identify some kind of useful "function" served by the Chinese system of imperial government, and argued that the more likely reason for its prolonged survival was that most people, especially peasants, simply accept their social system "unless and until something happens to threaten and destroy their daily routine."

Moore's theme of the bourgeoisie was that in the states that became democratic, there was a strong bourgeoisie. In Japan and China, the bourgeoisie was weak, and allied with the elites or peasants to create fascism or communism, respectively.

Reception
Theda Skocpol and Margaret Somers described Moore's book as a "work of virtually unparalleled ambition" in terms of substantive scope and complexity of its research design.

Jørgen Møller credits Moore's work for reviving "the classic field of research" of "comparative historical analysis" that Møller traces back "to Tocqueville, Weber, Hintze, Schumpeter, and Bloch."

Many authors have questioned parts of Moore's arguments. Dietrich Rueschemeyer, Evelyne Stephens, and John D. Stephens, in Capitalist Development and Democracy (1992) raise questions about Moore's analysis of the role of the bourgeoisie in democratization.

Samuel Valenzuela argues that, counter to Moore's view, the landed elite supported democratization in Chile.

A comprehensive assessment conducted by James Mahoney concludes that "Moore's specific hypotheses about democracy and authoritarianism receive only limited and highly conditional support."

He suspected that the left-leaning NRM might be supporting the Mwakenya Movement, a socialist Kenyan insurgent force. It was known that the NRM allowed Mwakenya fighters to travel freely through Uganda. Kenya consequently started to fund and arm UPA insurgents. In October 1987, tensions escalated into a firefight between the NRA and the Kenya Army at the border town of Busia. In response, Museveni publicly accused Kenya of supporting anti-NRM rebels. He deployed troops to the border, officially to stop guerrillas from crossing into Uganda; Moi responded by stating that any attempts by the NRA to violate the Kenyan border would be met with force. The Kenya Times, regarded as being close to Moi, accused the NRM of supporting Kenyan rebels, spying, kidnappings of Kenyans, and cattle rustling. On 15 December 1987, at least 26 NRA soldiers were killed during an incursion into Kenya, causing the tensions to almost escalate into open war. Although the situation was defused as a result of talks organized by Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia and Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, tensions continued.

The "Ninth of October Movement" (NOM), led by Dan Opito, ermerged around 1988. In February 1989, NOM began launching attacks into eastern and northeastern Uganda from Kenyan soil. It clashed with the NRA at Usuku. The group was suspected of links to ex-President Milton Obote. In March 1989, the Ugandan air force bombed the Kenyan town of Lokichogio. Although war was once again avoided, relations between Uganda and Kenya were not normalized until a meeting between Moi and Museveni in August 1990.
Crush is the debut collection of poetry by American poet Richard Siken. It was selected as the winner of the 2004 Yale Series of Younger Poets competition by Nobel laureate Louise Glück.

Themes 
The collection of poems contemplate infatuation, intimacy, loss, and grief. It is said that Siken's main inspiration was the death of his boyfriend in the early 1990s. 

The opening poem, Scheherazade (the title references to the character from One Thousand and One Nights) intimates inevitability and is foreboding in its tone. It positions the reader as an accomplice to its dealings. In Louise Glück's review of the poem, she makes the following observation, "Tell me, the poet says, the lie I need to feel safe, and tell me in your own voice, so I believe you. One more tale to stay alive."

Reception 
The Huffington Post's Victoria Chang praises the poet for writing with a "cinematic brilliance and urgency". 

In the foreword to Crush, competition judge Louise Glück wrote that the poems contained "cumulative, driving, apocalyptic power, [and] purgatorial recklessness", and that "Books of this kind dream big [...] They restore to poetry that sense of crucial moment and crucial utterance which may indeed be the great genius of the form."

o-Cresyl glycidyl ether (ortho-cresyl glycidyl ether, o-CGE) is a liquid aromatic organic chemical compound and chemically a glycidyl ether. It has the formula C10H12O2 and the CAS Registry Number 2210-79-9.  It is one of a number of glycidyl ethers available commercially that are used to reduce the viscosity of epoxy resins. These are then further used in coatings, sealants, adhesives and elastomers.

Uses
The main use of o-CGE is to reduce the viscosity of epoxy resins. These reduced viscosity resins may then be used to formulate coatings including UV cured versions. It is a monofunctional diluent and so in polymer science terms is a chain terminator. Chain extenders (f = 2) and cross linkers (f ≥ 3) are low molecular weight di or tri-functional epoxy diluents. The use of the diluent does effect mechanical properties and microstructure of epoxy resins. As it has glycidyl functionality, it is classed as a Reactive diluent.

Other names
o-CGE is known by a number of other names. These include: 
 Oxirane, 2-[(2-methylphenoxy)methyl]-
 Propane, 1,2-epoxy-3-(o-tolyloxy)-
 Oxirane, [(2-methylphenoxy)methyl]-
 2-[(2-Methylphenoxy)methyl]oxirane
 1-(o-Methylphenoxy)-2,3-epoxypropane

Toxicology
The material is a skin irritant and skin sensitizer. The toxicology has been reasonably well studied. It is REACH registered and produced or imported into the European Union in quantities greater than one thousand tonnes per annum.

Sphaerolobium linophyllum is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to the south of Western Australia. It is a prostrate to ascending shrub with a few narrowly linear leaves and red, yellow and orange flowers.

Description
Sphaerolobium linophyllum is a prostrate to ascending shrub that typically grows to a height of  and has many stems. It has only a few narrowly linear leaves, the longest  long and thick. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils with leafy bracts  long at the base. The sepals are about  long and joined at the base for more than half their length. The flowers are red, yellow and orange, the standard petal about  long, the wings curved and slightly shorter than the standard and the keel less than  long with a fringe of white hairs. Flowering occurs from September to February and the fruit is an inflated oval pod about  long.

Taxonomy
This species of pea was first formally described in 1864 by George Bentham who gave it the name Roea linophylla in Stephan Endlicher's Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de Hügel from an unpublished description by Charles von Hügel of specimens collected near the Swan River. In 1864, Bentham changed the name to Sphaerolobium linophyllum in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (linophyllum) means "thread-leaved".

Distribution and habitat
Sphaerolobium linophyllum grows in sandy soils and is widespread in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren bioregions of southern Western Australia and is listed as "not threatened" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.

Susan Joy Alexander is an Australian former professional tennis player.

Raised in Sydney, Australia, Alexander is an elder sister of tennis player John Alexander and began competing on tour during the 1960s. She featured in the singles second round at Wimbledon on three occasions and made the mixed doubles round of 16 with her brother in 1967. Her best Australian Open performance came in 1970 when she made the third round of the singles and was a quarter-finalist in women's doubles.
Ruth Mottram (born February 9, 1978) is a British climate scientist who is a researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute. Her research considers the development of climate models and the long-term dynamics of glaciers.

Early life and education 
Mottram studied geography at the University of Edinburgh. She earned a master's degree in 2000 before starting a master's of research in the natural environment. Her master's research considered tor formation and the exposure history of the Cairngorm Plateau. She made use of Cosmogenic Beryllium-10 and Aluminium-26. Cosmogenic nuclides can be used to date terrestrial landforms. It allowed Mottram to test hypotheses by quantifying rates of bedrock erosion, the formation of regoliths and the ages of bedrock surfaces. She joined Shell, where she was a graduate trainee in exploration, before leaving to start a doctorate in glaciology. Her research considered crevasse formation and the calving of glaciers.

Research and career 
Mottram uses the regional atmospheric climate model HIRHAM5. HIRHAM combines HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model, a short-range weather forecasting system), and ECHAM, a global climate model. She is based at the Danish Meteorological Institute where she primarily carries out research into the interactions between atnmosphere and ice sheet. but also contributes to the WCRP's CORDEX initiative, making regional climate simulations in the polar regions. 

Mottram is part of the Polar Portal team that carries out near real-time monitoring of the Arctic cryosphere, including live updates of satellite datasets of sea ice, icebergs, permafrost and Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance, She is also part of the European Space Agency's  climate change initiative for the Greenland ice sheet, under which she has contributed to IMBIE, a large international initiative aimed at quantifying the loss of the ice sheet, and published several articles comparing satellite data with climate models.  Her work also aims to run climate models to assess the likely future evolution of both the Greenland ice sheet, and the Antarctic ice sheet. She is frequently cited in the media on topics related to Arctic climate change and the Greenland ice sheet and contributes an annual update on the state of the ice sheet to the Carbon Brief news site. She is also interested in glacier processes and her research testing numerical models of crevasse depths directly led to a well-used technique to estimate the frequency of calving in ice sheet models. 

has said, "The sea ice surrounding Greenland is also changing. It is thinner, it breaks up earlier, and opens up more frequently,". The ice sheet is the world's second largest ice body and has a considerable impact on global climate. Mottram studied the Kangiata Nunaata Sermia, a large tidewater glacier in Greenland as part of a wider team of scientists. Such glaciers are not constrained to lab and extend to the ocean or sea, and calve to form icebergs. They made careful observations of the tidewater glacier, identifying sedimentary sequences and identifying that during the 12th century the glacier advanced 15 km. She looks to understand the long-term glacial dynamics of the Greenland ice sheet.

Selected publications
Garabet Artin Pasha Davoudian (also Garabed Artin Davoudian, Davud Pasha, Dawud Pasha) was an Ottoman career diplomat and the first mutasarrif  of Mount Lebanon from 1861 to 1868.

Early life 
Dawud Pasha was born around 1816 to an aristocratic Armenian Catholic family in Istanbul. He received his education in French and Ottoman schools.

Career 
Dawud Pasha was the first to hold the office of mutasarrif (governor) of the newly created, semi-autonomous Ottoman administrative sub-division of Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate in the aftermath of the 1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon and Damascus.

Before his tenure as governor, he served as a diplomatic attaché in Berlin and Vienna. He was raised to the rank of vizier and appointed as mutasarrif in 1861. The appointment was supposed to last for 3 years, but it was prolonged for another 5 years.

The appointment of a foreign mutasarrif caused widespread resentment in Mount Lebanon, particularly among Maronites feudal lords who contested their loss of power and influence. One of his major antagonists was Youssef Bey Karam, a local Maronite strongman who mounted a rebellion against the Ottomans from 1866 to 1867.

Despite the animosity of the local population, Dawud Pasha was credited with implementing a fair rule.

Resignation and exile 
The Ottoman foreign ministry was suspicious of Dawud Pasha's direct dealings with the European merchants and diplomatic delegations in Beirut; prerogative traditionally linked to his superior, the provincial governor. In 1868, Dawud Pasha pressured the Sublime Porte for more power by tendering his resignation, which was accepted. He was received back in Istanbul where he was appointed Minister of Public Works. He was later accused of corruption and exiled to France.
The Ferrari 166 F2 is an open-wheel formula racing single-seater car, designed, developed and built by Italian manufacturer and team Scuderia Ferrari, for Formula 2 racing, in 1948. This is the car in which Argentinian driver, and eventual five-time Formula One world champion, Juan Manuel Fangio, became known in Europe.

History
Inspired by the Ferrari 125 F1, the 166 F2 uses its improved and lowered chassis with a longer wheelbase which improves stability in turns. The front wheels are independent and the rear is fitted with a rigid axle, replaced in 1950 by a de Dion axle.

The Ferrari 166 F2 was the first of a long series of cars comprising the 166 families. After the 166 F2, Ferrari introduced the 166 S, 166 Inter, and 166 MM.

The Ferrari 166 F2 made its racing debut at the Florence Grand Prix on September 26, 1948, won by French driver Raymond Sommer, nicknamed the Boar of the Ardennes.

Design
The Ferrari 166 F2 was designed around the Ferrari 2-litre V12 engine which already fitted the 166 "civilian GT" versions with covered wheels, but whose power had been increased to 150 hp thanks to the adoption of three Weber 32DCF carburetors instead of one on the sports versions.

The Ferrari 166 F2, whose name derives mainly from its destination to participate in Formula 2 competitions, was the car that made the Argentinian driver Juan Manuel Fangio famous in Europe. The model he drove never sported Ferrari red but a blue/yellow livery in the colors of the Argentinian Automobile Club.

The 166 F2 has constantly evolved and will become more and more competitive until it uncompromisingly dominates the races of the time. With this car, Scuderia Ferrari won many victories: 6 out of 13 races in 1949, and 13 out of 18 races in 1950 and 1951 with drivers Ascari, Villoresi, and Fangio in particular.

In 1950, the Ferrari 166 F2 bearing the number 10 finished first in the Grand Prix du Cinquantenaire on the Parc Barbieux circuit in Roubaix, France. Driver Raymond Sommer finished the 101 laps in 2 hours 20 minutes 21 seconds and 1 hundredth.

Version 166 FL
In 1949, Ferrari launched the 166 FL version (for Formula Libre), also known as the 166 C America. This model was an evolution of the basic Italian version only intended for competitions on the South American continent in formula libre. The power of its engine reached 260 hp at 7000 rpm. This car dominated the Argentinian Temporadas for several seasons despite fierce competition from Alfa Romeo, Maserati, and other Mercedes-Benz.

The 166 FL in Argentine yellow and blue colors was built in 1949 for winter racing in Argentina. The 166 FL was the queen of the winters of 1950 and 1951 and Gonzalez led it to victory at the Buenos Aires GP in 1951. In 1953, three victories would be won by Villoresi and Ascari at the wheel of a Ferrari 166 FL.

Aberdeen Rovers Football Club was a football team from Aberdeen, Scotland who suffered the second-worst defeat in any Scottish senior football match, losing 35–0 to Dundee Harp on 12 September 1885 in a first round match of the Scottish Cup. The match was the same day as the biggest-ever win, as Arbroath beat fellow Aberdonians Bon Accord 36–0.

History

The club was formed in 1885, and played only two matches before its entry into the Scottish Cup; a 5–3 defeat at Bon Accord and a 1–0 defeat at Duthie Park against an early Peterhead side.  The Aberdeen media habitually referred to the club simply as Rovers.

Game v Dundee Harp in the Scottish Cup 

The match was played at Harp's East Dock Street ground with admission costing 3d.  Rovers were handicapped by only playing with ten men.  Allegedly the referee in the Harp-Aberdeen Rovers game had noted 37 goals, but Harp's secretary suggested a miscount must have occurred as he had recorded only 35. The match official, acknowledging that it was difficult for him to keep accurate details during such a deluge of goals, accepted the lower tally and wired the official score of 35–0 to SFA headquarters.  The contemporary reports however do not mention any disallowed goals, unlike for the Arbroath v Bon Accord match.

Dundee Harp full back Tom O'Kane was an ex-Arbroath player, and persuaded the Dundee club's officials to send a telegram to his former colleagues at Gayfield Park boasting of his team's record breaking achievement. The Harp players and officials were not to know that Arbroath had actually gone one better against another unfortunate Aberdeen side on that same afternoon. On receiving the Harp telegram, Arbroath officials took great delight in sending a reply boasting of the Angus side's superior achievement. It was only when O'Kane arrived back in Arbroath on the late Saturday evening train that he discovered the truth. Locals were quick to tell him that the Arbroath result was no joke and Harp's record-breaking claim was about to be lost.

Later history

The club entered the Scottish FA Cup twice more.  In 1887–88, it received a bye to the second round, and was drawn to play Wanderers of Dundee (later Johnstone/Dundee Wanderers), with the choice of ground; the Rovers accepted an inducement from the Wanderers to switch the tie to Morgan Park.  It may have been a mistake as Rovers lost 10–0, seven goals coming in the first half; the Rovers described as "a strong, heavy team" but lacking "combination" (teamwork).  The next season, it was drawn away to Wanderers again, and decided to withdraw from the competition.  The Rovers record of 0 goals for and 45 conceded in two ties, i.e. an average result of a 22.5 goals defeat per tie, means that the Rovers have the worst Scottish FA Cup record of any team.

The club was a founder member of the Aberdeenshire and District Football Association and played in the first Aberdeenshire Cup in 1887–88, reaching the semi-finals; the first round tie at Port Elphinstone saw the club's first and biggest competitive win, scoring six in the first half and winning 10–1.  In 1888–89 it reached the third round, losing 4–0 to Orion.

Although the club was exempted to the third round for the following year's competition, and given a bye into the fourth, the club appears to have dissolved before being able to participate.  At the start of the 1890–91 season, the club was struck off the Scottish Football Association membership list.

Colours

The club originally played in blue shirts and white shorts, and wore white shirts from 1888.

He served in the United States Army during World War I and the Mexico Campaign. Alland lived in Hitterdal, Clay County, Minnesota. Alland served as the Hitterdal Township assessor. He also served on the Hitterdal School Board and was the school board clerk. He served in the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1943 and 1944.
Kakiniit (sing. kakiniq) are the traditional tattoos of the Inuit of the North American Arctic. The practice is done almost exclusively among women, with women exclusively tattooing other women with the tattoos for various purposes. Men could also receive tattoos but these were often much less extensive than the tattoos a woman would receive. Facial tattoos are individually referred to as tunniit, and would mark an individual's transition to womanhood. The individual tattoos bear unique meaning to Inuit women, with each individual tattoo carrying symbolic meaning. However, in Inuinnaqtun, kakiniq refers to facial tattoos.

Historically, the practice was done for aesthetic,  medicinal purposes, part of the Inuit religion, and to ensure the individual access to the afterlife. Despite persecution by Christian missionaries during the 20th century, the practice has seen a modern revival by organizations such as the Inuit Tattoo Revitalization Project. Many Inuit women wear the tattoos as a source of pride in their Inuit culture.

Etymology 

Kakiniq (singular) or kakiniit (plural) is an Inuktitut term which refers to Inuit tattoos, while the term tunniit specifically refers to women's facial tattoos. The terms are rendered in Inuktitut syllabics as ᑲᑭᓐᓃᑦ (Kakinniit), ᑲᑭᓐᓂᖅ (Kakinniq), and ᑐᓃᑦ (Tuniit).

The Proto-Inuit-Yupik root *kaki- means 'pierce or prick'; this is etymon for the  Iñupiaq (North Alaskan Inuit) kakinʸɨq* 'tattoo', Eastern Canadian Inuktitut kakiniq 'tattoo', West Greenlandic kakiuʀniʀit 'tattoos', and Tunumiit (East Greenlandic) 'kaɣiniq 'tattoo'. The root kaki- also means tattoo in Inuvialuktun (Western Canadian Inuktitut). The Proto-Inuit word *tupə(nəq) 'tattoo' is the etymology of Eastern Canadian Inuktitut tunniq 'woman's facial tattoo'. This might go back to Proto-Inuit-Yupik-Unangan *cumi-n 'ornamental dots'.

Description 

Kakiniit are tattoos done on the body, and tunniit are tattoos done on the face, they served a variety of symbolic purposes. Commonly, the tattooed portions would consist of the arms, hands, breasts, and thighs. In some extreme cases, some women would tattoo their entire bodies. According to filmmaker Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, the stomach area was scarcely tattooed, with her remarking that she had never heard of the practice being done in that area of the body. The markings are done on women and the practice of tattooing was done by women. Men would not receive the same tattoos as women, the tattoos men would receive would be much less extensive than female tattoos, and served the purpose as an amulet. However, there were reports of men who were raised female and received tunniit who later were wed as second wives. The patterns would consist of dots, zig-zags, shapes, and lines. The practice of facial tattooing is considered a part of coming into womanhood for Inuit women. Women were unable to marry until their faces were tattooed, and the tattoos meant that they had learned essential skills for later in life. 

Designs would vary depending on the region. Each individual pattern has symbolic meaning to its wearer, and served a variety of purposes. Some are often given to commemorate a significant life event. Y shaped markings represent essential tools used during the seal hunt, V shaped markings on the forehead represent entering womanhood, stripes on the chin represent a woman's first period, chest tattoos are given after childbirth and symbolize motherhood, and markings on the arms and fingers reference to the legend of Sedna. Due to persecution of the practice during the 20th century, and the subsequent loss of the meaning that some of the tattoos had embodied, modern wearers often invent new meanings for the tattoos as they reclaim the practice.

Process 
Tattooists were usually older women who had experience in embroidery. Traditionally, the practice was done through sinew from cariboo that was spun into a thread and was soaked in a combination of qulliq lampblack and seal suet. The thread would then be poked under the skin through the use of a needle made of bone, wood, or steel. Other tools used historically were pokers, and knives, all these tools would be held in a seal-intestine skin bag. Once the tattoo had been completed, the tattooed area would be sterilized with a mixture of urine and soot.

In modern times, the practice is primarily done through the use of a tattoo machine and its use of needles and ink. Both practices, the poking method and the gun method, are used in modern times, with the traditional poking method employed by those who wish for the practice to be done traditionally.

History and archaeology 
Inuit legends regarding the meaning of the individual tattoos refer to the sea goddess Sedna. Of whom, while being thrown overboard by her angry father, had her fingers chopped off, the disembodied digits would become sea animals. Tattoos on the hands and arms refer to the story, representing where her hands were cut. Wearers of kakiniit in Inuit tradition would ensure that in the afterlife, the woman would be able to go to a place of happiness and good things. According to tradition, women who did not have hand tattoos would be denied access to the afterlife by Sedna, while women without facial tattoos were sent to the land of Noqurmiut, the "land of the crestfallen" where women would spend an eternity with smoke coming from their throat and their head hanging downwards.

According to anthropologist Lars Krutak, Inuit practices of tattooing remained unchanged for millennia. Prehistoric evidence of tattooing found on Alaska's St. Lawrence Island resembled tattoos found on Greenlandic women in the 1880s. The practice was widespread and unchanged prior to colonization. On top of making individuals happy, the practice was done for a variety of reasons historically, some for acupuncture or as pain relief, beautification, and shamanistic reasons. With the introduction of Western medicine and fashion, the former reasons fell out of favour among Inuit, the third reason was extirpated through pressure from missionaries.
The practice of kakiniit was banned by the Catholic Church and missionaries during the early 20th century, who saw the practice as evil due to its non-Christian nature.  Traditionally a source of pride and a rite of passage for Inuit women, the practice was considered shamanistic to the Catholic missionaries and the communities that they worked to convert. Biblical passages forbidding the practice of tattooing served as additional pressure to forbid the practice. The efforts of Anglican missionary Edmund Peck, who was fluent in Inuktitut, were particularly effective in extirpating Inuit cultural and religious practices, including kakiniit. However, the practice was not entirely extirpated during the time, and the practice went underground.

Modern practice 
The practice has seen a recent resurgence due to increased awareness and revitalization efforts, in addition to concerns regarding the extirpation of the practice. Organizations such as the Inuit Tattoo Revitalization Project, founded in 2017 and led by Angela Hovak Johnson, serve to revive the tradition and bring the practice back in Inuit communities. Johnson started the organization when she found out that the practice was to die out with the last Inuk woman with facial tattoos. The practice was brought to further public knowledge following the release of the film Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner. Inuit filmmaker Alethea Arnaquq-Baril's 2010 film, Tunniit: Retracing the Lines of Inuit Tattoos, documents the history behind the practice. Arnaquq-Baril interviewed 58 elders representing 10 Inuit communities during the course of the film. Many Inuit figures bear traditional tattoos to showcase their embracing of their heritage, including: Celina Kalluk, Lucie Idlout, Angela Hovak Johnston, Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory, Nancy Mike, and Johnny Issaluk. Member of Parliament Mumilaaq Qaqqaq, who was elected in 2019 and representing the riding of Nunavut, wore traditional facial tattoos.

The Unpredictability of Predictability is a live solo percussion album by Jerome Cooper. It was recorded in July 1979 at Soundscape in New York City, and was released on LP by About Time Records later that year.

On the album, Cooper plays a variety of instruments, including flute, whistle, balaphone, chirimia, bass drum, cymbal, drums, and tom tom. Writer John Szwed commented: "Cooper added a balafon and horns to his kit... so that he could play like an old-time one-man band (though the results sounded more African than African American)".

In the album liner notes, Cooper wrote: "This is not just an album for drummers... anyone into music can dig this music. Classical music people can dig it because it's structured. People into rock, because of the beat, people into jazz because of the improvisational aspect, and those into ethnic music because of the instruments involved".

Reception

In a review for AllMusic, Brian Olewnick wrote: "This superb musician... treats his solo performances as free-standing compositions scored for only certain instruments from which he extracts huge volumes of sounds and rhythms... Cooper has no interest in wowing the listener by playing fast or loud, but simply desires to develop lovely rhythms and melodic patterns and allow them to flower. A fine recording and wonderful antidote for those who claim to be bored by drum solos."

Author W. C. Bamberger stated that, in "Movement A, B", a listener "coming to an album billed as solo percussion with expectations of a certain busy-ness" must "let Cooper set his own terms", while in "Movement C", one can "most clearly hear the effects of Cooper's conception of the drum kit as a confederation of separate instruments" as he plays "a kind of lively Q&A session between drums, and between drum and hi-hat". Bamberger described "Bert The Cat" as "skittering, tail-in-the-air fun".

John Corbett called the album a "must-have LP". Drummer Tyshawn Sorey included the recording in a list of "albums featuring live drums that have inspired me over the years".

Alper Derinboğaz (Turkish pronunciation: [alpæɾ deɾiɲboːaz]; born in 1982) is a Turkish architect, and founder of Salon Alper Derinboğaz. The practice was recognised as one of Archdaily’s Best Young Practices of 2020. Derinboğaz represented Turkey in its debut year at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2014 with the installation Modalities of the Spontaneous, an investigation of the urban transformation of Istanbul.

Career 
Derinboğaz graduated from Istanbul Technical University in 2005 and received the Fulbright scholarship to study at UCLA, where he won the Graduate Award for his master’s studies. He founded Salon Alper Derinboğaz while working in Los Angeles.

In 2019, he was selected as one of the 40 Under 40 architects of Europe by The European Center. Later, his office was named a "Best Young Practice" in 2020 by Archdaily. He is frequently invited to events as a speaker and his works have been published and exhibited in global art and architectural publications. He also teaches architectural and urban design studios as an adjunct professor.

Work 

Derinboğaz’s projects vary from large scale cultural institutions to art installations and masterplans. His work investigates the possibilities of the physical environment through the relationship between space and time. According to Chris Van Uffelen, his work breaks up conventional thinking to create innovative and flexible design solutions. Derinboğaz defines his practise as an intent to create continuities between human, space and the earth in his book project where he gathers his research since 2011.

In 2014, his work “Modalities of the Spontaneous” was exhibited in the 14th Venice Architecture Biennale as part of the Turkish Pavilion, Places of Memory. This work was a series of reliefs generated through an investigation into the transformation of urban texture in the Levent district in Istanbul. Starting from the idea that the Turkish largest city has grown “spontaneously” over time, Derinboğaz questioned how the underlying geographic and socio-economic background shaped the evolution of the city in the last 100 years and possibly will go on to do so in the future.
Derinboğaz’s museum works are mostly characterised by social dialogue and contextual understanding. The most significant of these is the Museum of Istanbul project that is located next to the UNESCO listed Theodosian Land Walls in İstanbul. This building aims to link land walls to the modern transportation hub in the Topkapi area, seeking to activate a public space that connects the history of the city with contemporary society.

His adaptive re-use project Fitaş Passage is completed in 2019, located in İstiklal Avenue which is a vibrant pedestrian axis in Istanbul. This project reclaims an historic arcade space while seeking a new relationship with the avenue. The facade of the building is designed with angled vertical panels by considering the perceived view while walking on the street. These vertical facade elements, reminiscent of the historic vertical signboards, aim to create a spatial interactivity between building and street.

Akce Asanace (English: Sanitation Act) was the cover name for a Czechoslovak StB (secret police) operation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with which the Communist regime tried to force inconvenient people, especially signatories of Charter 77, to leave the country. Various forms of psychological and physical coercion and blackmail were used, including forcing individuals to emigrate. Prominent individuals against whom this was used include Milan Hlavsa, Vratislav Brabenec, Vlastimil Třešňák, Jaroslav Jeroným Neduha, Jaroslav Hutka, Svatopluk Karásek, Václav Malý, Karol Sidon, Petr Cibulka, and Pavel Landovský.

Origin and progression
On 21 December 1977, then-Minister of the Interior, Jaromír Obzina, issued an order to "achieve the complete disintegration and isolation of the main organizers of Charter 77 from other signatories, and the selected organizers of this event to be evicted from the Czechoslovak Republic". The StB focused especially on younger and lesser-known dissidents, because they were not so visible and their persecution did not provoke significant protest. Common methods of coercion were physical violence and blackmail. For those who agreed to emigrate, the StB ensured that all necessary formalities were completed without complications. Pressure peaked between 1980 and 1981, as the government was afraid the Charter 77 movement would join forces with Poland's nascent Solidarity.

In all, 280 signatories of Charter 77, i.e., about 15% of the total number, were forced to emigrate, including ten members of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS). The operation also swept up dissidents that had not signed the charter, such as Radko Pavlovec, a noted anti-fascist activist who had been imprisoned between 1952 and 1960 at the Jáchymov labor camp. Akce Asanace ended in 1984 and was followed by a similar operation, named Akce Klín.

Aftermath and trials
In 1999, criminal trials of several politicians and members of the StB associated with Akce Asanace began and continue to this day. Jaromír Obzina escaped conviction, as he died in January 2003. Most of those convicted have received suspended sentences. In September 2021, courts recognized four additional StB employees who had persecuted Charter 77 signatories such as Vratislav Brabenec of The Plastic People of the Universe and Jaroslav Jeroným Neduha of Extempore, though their verdicts have not been finalized yet.

Popular usage
The term "Asanace" has been used in contexts that refer to government persecution or prohibition, as in the case of Asanace2, a call for the Czech government to legalize the use and growing of cannabis products.

 Shangdi, the Chinese term for "Supreme Deity" in religious ConfucianismThe Union School in Natchez was the first public, co-educational school by the city for African American students formed in 1871 and closed c. 1925, and was located at the southeast corner of North Union and Monroe Streets in Natchez, Mississippi.

History 
The Union School was established in 1871 as a brick building and it had thirteen rooms which held up to 948 children. The school opened in the fall of 1871, led by Theodore H. Greene and employed 9 black teachers, with the enrollment of 406 students. In 1887, the school was led by principal John S. Meekins, with enrollment of 267 students. By 1909, the school had enrollment of 1,175 students. In 1924, the lower grade levels had as many as 120 students in a single classroom, which prompted the school board to plea with the mayor to make changes.

In 1925, the Brumfield High School, another African American public school in Natchez, was built to alleviate the overcrowding. The school namesake was George Washington Brumfield (1866–1927) who had taught classes at the Union School and served as a principal, after his arrival to Natchez in the 1890s. Brumfield also served as the Sunday school teacher at Zion Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Zion Chapel AME Church).

The Union School operated during a period of racial segregation in Mississippi. The Natchez Institute was the first public school by the city for white-only students, established in 1845. By 1950s, the Union School building was demolished. The school is included in the "African American Public Education, Natchez Trails" historical marker at its former site.

"Jump" is a song by American singer Ciara, featuring American hip hop group Coast Contra. It was released on July 8, 2022, through Ciara's own label Beauty Marks Entertainment, in partnership with Uptown and Republic Records. It is a mid-tempo dance song that is expected to be included on Ciara's upcoming eighth album, her first released in partnership with Uptown and Republic Records. 

"Jump" was praised by critics for its anthemic qualities. The release was followed by an accompanying music video the same day, which received praise for its 14 outfits and looks and high octane dancing which paid tribute to previous Ciara music videos, as well as earning comparisons to Ciara's inspiration, Janet Jackson.

Background and release 
In an interview with Rated R&B in May 2022, Ciara confirmed that her eighth album was complete and its first music video has been filmed. Around the same time, Ciara announced a new record which would see her record label Beauty Marks Entertainment partner with Uptown Records and Republic Records to release her eight studio album, at the time of announcement the album title and release date had not been unveiled. Speaking of the deal to work with Uptown and Republic, Ciara said: 

Chris Malone Méndez from Forbes commented on Ciara's time in the music industry saying that during the 2000s, "Ciara's music was inescapable, reverberating from club walls and car speakers everywhere". Méndez also noted however that in the 2010s, although still popular, Ciara's "personal circumstances" were more public than her music. Following Beauty Marks, Ciara had also launched a clothing label, LITA by Ciara, as well as writing a children's novel Why Not You? with husband Russell Wilson. "Jump" is Ciara's first single in two years, following 2020 single "Rooted". Prior to this, Ciara released another standalone single "Melanin" featuring Lupita Nyong'o, La La Anthony and City Girls, as well as promoting her then-latest album Beauty Marks (2019). Describing the song, Ciara said "I'm back on my mission to make the world dance", while also confirming that it would be the first single from her then-upcoming eight album. "Jump" features upcoming American hip hop group Coast Contra and was released on July 8, 2022. The music video was released at 12pm EST.

Music and lyrics 
"Jump" is a mid-tempo dance song, described by Stereogums Rachel Brodsky as bass-heavy, stating that it "sounds ready-made for sports arenas". Ciara wrote the lyrics alongside Theron Thomas from songwriter-artist duo Rock City, while Sam Sumser and Sean Smill composed the music. All four musicians are credited with producing the song. Rachel Blum, DJ Riggins, Jaycen Joshua, Jacob Richards and Mike Seaberg were all involved in mixing the track, while Joshua and Andrew "Andy" Park engineered the song. Thomas previously collaborated with Ciara on her single 2018 single "Level Up", which was also the first single from her previous album Beauty Marks (2019). 

Lyrics include the lines "I know what you want from me / If you wanna have fun with me / Wanna be on the winning team." During promotion for the song, Ciara said "Jump" was a celebratory anthem, reflecting on her journey since her previous album Beauty Marks (2019), "it celebrates the beautiful shades of culture that comprise the inner and outer beauty of everyone. Embracing the unique nature of our skin tones threads together the tapestry of humankind." Describing the song, Ciara said "I feel like some of my best music is what I call stadium music ... It's also what I call 'Ghetto-Pop,' Its songs that can play in the hood and beyond, and that's always been important to me since day one."

Critical reception 
Writing for The Denver Post, Tiney Ricciardi called "Jump" a "booty bouncing blowout with enough jiggle and shake to carry you through to football season". Writing for Rap-Up, Devin said "Jump" was a "TikTok-ready anthem that will have you dancing all summer long." Parlemag noted that even based on social media teasers, fans called the song a bop. Meredith B. Kile from ET agreed, saying that "Jump" was a "club-ready" anthem. "Jump" was picked for inclusion on BrooklynVegans "our favorite songs of the week playlist".

Promotion 

Ciara began promoting the song with short clips via Twitter in June 2022. One such clip featured the singer twerking atop a Ford Bronco. The inclusion of a Bronco was a significant bit of cross-promotion, given that her husband, quarterback Russell Wilson, had recently moved to the Denver Broncos. The video itself garnered attention from fans for gas station where it was filmed, due to the inclusion of high gas prices. Alongside the song's release, Ciara released a media statement and made appearances on Good Morning America to promote the release. The wide-ranging interview discussed the song's meaning as well as her journey to becoming an independent artist. 

A social media post on Instagram about the song said, "I wanna see you… Jump into the new YOU. Jump into LOVE (Loving on you:)) Jump into FUN. Jump into DANCE. What you waiting for? ". Further posts leading up to the song's released included more teasers and also the song's single cover, which featured an outfit made of Air Jordan 4 sneakers. The outfit was made by Cierra Boyd, who previously made similar looks for the likes of Cardi B, Kat Graham and Kim Petras amongst others. The look from the cover art had been teased by Ciara a few days prior during a brief video on Instagram.

Music video

Background and concept 

A music video for "Jump" was directed by Dave Meyers, who Ciara previously worked with on Missy Elliott's "Lose Control" (2005) and her own "Dance Like We're Making Love" (2015). The music video premiered on July 8, 2022, at 12PM EST. Describing the moment the video premiered, Ciara said "this moment is special for so many reasons… just considering the timing of where we've all been in this world, this time of creativity for me", going on to describe dance as a universal language, and wanting to make people dance and have the best time while listening to the song. The video features no fewer than 14 outfits/looks, with Ciara stating it was the most work and effort she had put into a music video. Some of the looks drew comparisons to Janet Jackson and the video was filmed across four days. According to Vibe, the video high energy and paid tribute to a number of Ciara's own "iconic dance moves" and looks, including recreating a scene dancing atop a car from her 2010 song "Ride". The Winston-Salem State University Powerhouse Red & White cheerleading squad also feature in the music video. The group flew out to Los Angeles to film for the music video and praised Ciara and her team for how the squad were treated; each squad member was assigned a crew member to look after them on set. Speaking about how the squad became involved in the video, one of their coaches NeSheila Washington explained that one of Ciara's dancers spotted the squad on Instagram, before sending a message via the app to say "they would be a great fit for the song".

Synopsis 
The video opens with a scene of Ciara chanting the song's chorus and performing a cheer routine with the WSSU 'Powerhouse of Red and White Cheerleaders'. During this segment, the group chant: "You like it when I make that thang jump, You go Wow when I make that thing jump/ It get loud when I make that thing jump, It’s a party when I make that thing jump." Across 14 looks, Ciara dances across multiple scenes including "dancing through the roof", "moving trains" and "power lines". Following the cheer scene, the music video jumps to Ciara in red curly hair, twerking "in a parking lot full of low riders" before transitioning to a rooftop scene featuring Ciara in "an all black-ensemble in knee-high sneakers", recreating the "Ciara walk" from her "Goodies" music video (2004). The fourth scene finds Ciara dancing on an electrical wire in a set consisting of loose-fitting trousers, a white crop top, trench coat, and bucket hat, with a silver chain necklace and white sneakers. 

The next scene features Ciara as a daytime "1, 2 Step" dance instructor, shouting, "They can't jump with us, can't mess with us, drop that ass girl! Make 'em say 'wow!' Drop that ass girl, make it clap loud. Let's go!" before her and women perform aerobics to the song's chorus. In the next scene, Ciara dances at the beach in a taupe swimsuit, supported by dancers in similar attire. The next scene features Ciara dancing on top of car, which she noted as a reference to her video for "Oh" in 2005. It is followed by a scene in which "her hair turned into sparkler candles as she whipped it around in a black bikini top and latex pants."

Subsequent scenes feature Ciara dancing in the street in football uniform and then performing with Coast Contra during their verse, "surrounded by 4-wheelers".

Amber Corrine from Vibe praised the music video for being a visual experience and event, "'Jump' brings us back to the days when music videos actually felt like an experience. From a 14-outfit wardrobe change to epic scenery, choreographed dance routines, coupled with captivating graphic effects." Fellow artist, British singer Sam Smith gave the song a positive review having watched the video upon its release; Smith said "I just saw the 'JUMP' video. I’m trying not to swear right now. [Laughs] Unbelievable! Unbelievable. Amazing. [Points to fans] You are going to die! Insane, insane! Ugh!".

Release history
According to records from the RSSSF, there were many association football cup competitions organized in Zambia since 1962, some of which are the Independence Cup, the Zambian Challenge Cup (both organized in 1961), the Champion of Champions Cup (organized in 1974) and Zambian Coca-Cola Cup, the latter which began in 2001. These competitions are either inactive or were played no more as of 2009.

Independence Cup
The Northern Rhodesia Castle Cup, rebranded two years later as the Independence Cup due to the independence of Zambia, was launched in 1962 by the Football Association of Zambia as the top knockout tournament in Zambian football. Until 1965, the winners of this competition were pitted against the winners of the cup competition in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in the "Super Castle Cup" (the equivalent of today's super cups).

Its winners did not always enter the African Cup Winners' Cup; an entry was often reserved for the winners of the African Cup of Champions Clubs (now the CAF Champions League) which usually contested between four clubs.

It got rebranded as the Mosi Cup in 1993 and has not been played or organized since its last edition in 2007.

The Joe Mee House is an historic residence located in Willcox, Arizona.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

The house is the only known example of an adobe Craftsman bungalow in southern Arizona.  The use of adobe was most likely used due to its local availability, and this house is a unique use combining the materials and style. It is most likely that the structure was built by a local cattleman, Joe Mee, who was the son-in-law of the founder of Willcox, Henry A. Morgan.  The contractor was W. S. Hunt, and was built around 1920. At one point, the house served as a mortuary.

Sitting on a concrete foundation, the house has a medium gable roof with two chimneys, covered with wooden shingles. It has projecting eaves with exposed rafters and a wood shingle pediment.  The main entrance is an off-center wood door with a single light and a wooden screen door; while the porches are open with an open railing and plain posts, covered with a gabled roof and wood-shingle pediment.  The original garage has been converted into a guest house, and at some point in the 1930s an addition was added to the rear of the structure.

 Europe-Asia Studies, formerly Soviet Studies, an academic peer-reviewed journalMelville Cox Brown (August 16, 1838 – April 9, 1928) was an American politician and jurist.

Biography
Brown was born on August 16, 1838, on a farm in Kennebec County, Maine, near Augusta, the son of Captain Enoch and Sarah S. (née Reed) Brown, the former supposedly a descendent of Mayflower passenger Peter Browne. He grew up in Maine before heading West at eighteen, settling in Oroville, California, before moving to Florence, Idaho Territory, in 1862. The following year, he moved to Centerville, where he studied law under a Judge Kelley, and was elected as a Republican to represent Boise County in the Idaho Territorial House of Representatives. Brown was then appointed by President Lincoln as assistant assessor of internal revenue for the territory, and became assessor when his superior, Calvin Bodfish, died.

After having success as a mining investor, Brown relocated to Cheyenne, Dakota Territory, in 1867, to practice law. The following year, he moved his practice to Laramie, Wyoming Territory, which would remain his home for most of the following sixty years. He married Nancy W. Fillmore in Laramie on May 20, 1870, and they would have three daughters. That same year, he was elected as chairman of the Wyoming Territorial Republican Party, and in 1871, he was elected to the Wyoming Territorial House of Representatives. He would later serve as the first mayor of Laramie and district attorney for Albany County. In 1880, he was appointed as U.S. Attorney for the Territorial District of Wyoming, which he would serve as for four years. In 1889, he was chosen as a delegate to the Wyoming Constitutional Convention, which elected him as its president.

Brown practiced law throughout the West, and on March 6, 1900, President William McKinley nominated him as the U.S. Territorial District Judge for the District of Alaska, to which he was confirmed by the United States Senate on the 13th. Once there, he heard cases in Sitka and Wrangell. He term expired in 1904 and he practiced law in Seattle until 1907, returning the following year to Laramie, where he practiced law until his retirement. While he was successful in his law practice, his business ventures were generally unsuccessful, and upon his death due to heart failure in Laramie on April 9, 1928, he left an estate valued at $2,500.

"The Longest Marge" is the eleventh episode of the thirty-third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons, and the 717th episode overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on January 2, 2022. The episode was directed by Matthew Nastuk and written by Brian Kelley.

This episode is dedicated to John Madden, who appeared in a 1999 episode "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday". He died five days before the episode aired.

The episode was broadcast at 9:00 PM EST instead of the usual 8:00 PM EST slot. The title of the episode is a reference to the 2005 sports comedy "The Longest Yard".

Plot
At the Power Plant, everyone is gone from their workplace, following the sports channel's On the Clock where Anger Watkins is presenting the Springfield Atoms's draft, picking Grayson Mathers. The workers start rioting the town right afterwards in celebration while Mr. Burns and Waylon Smithers are reviewing corporate revenue going down where his liquor company Mr. Gentleman Brandy is having all the losses due to their ad campaign.

To reinvent the brand, the branding expert Warburton Parker is brought in. Ultimately, Burns overhears the cheers for Grayson and he hires him as the new face of the company. The Simpson family goes to the Springfield Atoms Stadium for the match against the Chargers where they find him a complete mess after drinking so much liquor and everyone boos him.

To prove his worth, Grayson is brought to the Springfield Elementary for a speech, but all goes down when the bullies start offending him and he starts throwing books at them. He chugs another bottle of Brandy and passes out to urethra pains, waking up in the infirmary, where Marge Simpson is taking care of him and tells him to slow down. A partnership is then formed with Burns where Marge takes care of his home needs while Burns takes care of the rest.

Marge takes him home for the family dinner where he tells the story of how just as a little kid he was brought in the football career and he tells them how he never sees his parents in person afterward, so Marge starts teaching him how to be in a family and invites him to stay for a while as she teaches him how to use the dishwasher, get his drug test all negatives, go to a normal church, and giving him a birthday party.

At the party, Mr. Burns arrives ready to take him on party night, but Marge stops him by having him rememberhow he has a football match the next day. The next, day his match was a success, but Burns notices how he has become a mama's boy. At home, Marge and Burns start arguing and have him breakdown after they put him on a choice between the two.

Grayson leaves in his Ferrari and then sends Marge a ticket for the Sports Channel's annual awards show at The Draft Pigs Center for the Performing Arts, happy she's his plus one. In the Draft Pigs Center, she finds out that Burns was given the invitation too.

When Grayson is shown for the award for Most Inspiring Athlete, Marge and Burns start connecting instead of fighting as Grayson wins. When Grayson thanks the person that inspired him, he mentions his fiancée Kaitlyn, whom he met 3 days before, that he made his business manager. Marge and Burns find out they've been replaced by her.

Reception

Viewing figures 
The episode was watched by 2.02 million viewers, scoring a 0.7 demo rating.

Critical response 
Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3.5 stars out of five stating, "'The Longest Marge' ultimately plays too safe a game to do a victory dance in the end zone. It works on every level, but not quite hard enough. There are excellent individual gags, exchanges, and visual puns. The premise, promise and preface set up all the makings of a killer payoff, and then it cops out with a boozy Parent Trap scenario which doesn't quite satisfy. The installment almost pulls off a seditious treat when Grayson throws it all away for his trophy future wife Kaitlin, the guru of a faith-based yogurt yoga chain which you eat while doing yoga. It is only a tease, however, to the savage satire which could have been delivered. One Hail Mary pass should have done it."

Burkely Hermann of Bubbleblabber gave the episode 5.5 out of 10 stating, "It was a bit weird to have an episode where Bart nor Lisa has that many lines, with more lines by Homer and Marge than either of the kids. The guest stars, Beck Bennett (voicing Grayson Mathers), John Mulaney (voicing Warburton Parker), and Adam Schefter were a nice touch. I suppose I liked this episode, but I didn’t really laugh during it. The drama and story was good, but the comedy was dull. I hope that will improve in the future, although I’m not entirely sure it will."

The 1993 Miller Genuine Draft 400 was the 14th stock car race of the 1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season and the 25th iteration of the event. The race was held on Sunday, June 20, 1993, in Brooklyn, Michigan, at Michigan International Speedway, a two-mile (3.2 km) moderate-banked D-shaped speedway. The race took the scheduled 200 laps to complete. In the final laps of the race, Hendrick Motorsports driver Ricky Rudd would manage to take advantage of a fuel-stricken Mark Martin, coasting his car to the finish on fuel to take his 14th career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory and his only victory of the season. To fill out the top three, Hendrick Motorsports driver Jeff Gordon and Morgan–McClure Motorsports driver Ernie Irvan would finish second and third, respectively.

Background 

The race was held at Michigan International Speedway, a two-mile (3.2 km) moderate-banked D-shaped speedway located in Brooklyn, Michigan. The track is used primarily for NASCAR events. It is known as a "sister track" to Texas World Speedway as MIS's oval design was a direct basis of TWS, with moderate modifications to the banking in the corners, and was used as the basis of Auto Club Speedway. The track is owned by International Speedway Corporation. Michigan International Speedway is recognized as one of motorsports' premier facilities because of its wide racing surface and high banking (by open-wheel standards; the 18-degree banking is modest by stock car standards).

The former Collegio degli Scolopi is a large building in Florence, annexed to the church of San Giovanni degli Scolopi and located between via de 'Martelli, via dei Gori, Piazza San Lorenzo and Borgo San Lorenzo. Formerly the palace of the Martelli family (which gave the street its name), it was the seat of the Jesuit order, designed on a grand scale by Bartolomeo Ammannati, then housed the college of the Piarists and finally, after the suppression of the convents, it became a school. Today most of its rooms are occupied by the Galileo state classical high school, but in one part there is also the Ximenian observatory, with access from the rear Borgo San Lorenzo.

History

Originally, a convent, there were many houses belonging to various families, including the Martelli and Gori Ciampellis. On the side of Piazza San Marco it was the House of Medici. In 1557, the church and the annexed houses were granted to the Jesuits who erected the convent and enlarged the church. Once the Jesuits were suppressed, it was given to the Piarist Fathers who established their college there. Without prejudice to the close link between this building and the nearby church of San Giovannino, it can be identified in particular as the date of origin of the current complex in 1554, when part of this area was granted by Cosimo I de' Medici to the Jesuits in order to found a college there. They entrusted the design to Bartolomeo Ammannati so that, even before the construction of the church, in 1579, part of the building could be considered defined. However, various obstacles did not allow the completion of the works which, having remained interrupted for many years, only resumed in 1620 based on a project by architect Giulio Parigi.

In the second half of the 17th century the college still showed a considerable degree of indeterminacy, with a courtyard of which only the arm towards via de 'Martelli had finished and the one to the south had just begun. This situation did not change until, in 1686, the grand-ducal architect Giovanni Battista Foggini took charge of a new project. The latter opened an important construction site in 1688, followed later in the 19th century by Origoni.

The definitive configuration of the complex took place in the 19th century, with the purchase of further houses of the Martelli by the Town Hall (1836), followed by the expansion and definition of the facade on via de 'Martelli, by the completion of the walls of the courtyard, and the latest transformations of the facade facing Piazza San Lorenzo, all based on the design and construction supervision of the architect Leopoldo Pasqui, who closed the construction site in July 1838. Starting from 1878, part of the structure houses the Galileo state classical high school.

Description

Externally it is a large building of simple shapes, characterized by a door of character of the end of the seventeenth century and with decorations among which the trigram of Christ, arms of the Society of Jesus, is inserted, to identify it as the initial property of the Jesuits.

As for the appearance of the front, note on the right of the door a small tabernacle with a Madonna and Child, a marble bas-relief already approached in the manner of sculptor Bernardo Rossellino and now brought back to a master conventionally referred to by this work as "Maestro di Via Martelli" (restored in 1999). In the upper part of the façade there are four almond-shaped shields bearing respectively the weapons and the insignia: of the Martelli; of the Municipality (chiseled) and of the Piarists; of the chapter of San Lorenzo and of the Gori Ciampelli; of the Piarists.

There are three plaques: the living room of Leonardo da Vinci in 1508, who lived here with Giovanni Francesco Rustici, the concession to the Piarists of the houses of the Martelli, and the residence of the Pious Schools from 1775 to 1878.

The literature also indicates a small square on the façade with the coat of arms of the Chapter of San Lorenzo inscribed in a circle, with the number 30 below, which however is not visible today. In the hall there is a plaque with the Bulletin of Victory by General Diaz.

The portion of Piazza San Lorenzo, Marcello Jacorossi is the simplest and least adorned part of the large building which was used for a long time as a convent and college. The lines are simple and the stone parts without decoration. The Fathers of the Society of Jesus to whom the church of San Giovanni Evangelista had been granted in 1557, bought the houses and shops that were in this place and included them in the new building of their convent. In 1773 the Fathers of the Pious Schools had the large room and reduced this part of the building to its present form. Towards the corner of via de 'Gori, a small but graceful tabernacle that contains a tablet with the head of the Madonna, a good painting from the second half of the 16th century. On the side of via de 'Gori, always close to the corner, there is an inscription relating to a notice of the Eight of guards and balia dated to ca. 1698. In the short entrance hall there are three monumental twisted columns, from where you enter the Ximenian Observatory.

Ximenian Observatory

The Observatory houses two specialized libraries, one ancient and one modern, rooms for measuring equipment and numerous historical collections (especially instruments for radio transmissions, astronomical and meteorological observations, seismological instruments), arranged in such a way as to be able to be used as a historical-didactic path. There is also a reproduction of the first internal combustion engine in history, by Barsanti Matteucci. The premises contain some important works of the Florentine sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, albeit in undervalued locations, near the stairwell. Among these are Giovanni Bizzelli's Sant'Elena (1587), San Girolamo supported by an angels, among the masterpieces of Jacopo Ligozzi, and an Immaculate Conception by Francesco Curradi.

The building also incorporates the ancient Torre dei Rondinelli, at the top of which the Observatory tower has been obtained, with the white dome for astronomical observations, clearly visible from the whole city.

Tim Watson-Munro (born 1952/1953) is an Australian forensic psychologist. His expertise has been used in some of Australia's biggest criminal trials. He has analysed some of Australia's most prolific and violent criminals including underworld figure Alphonse Gangitano and mass murderer Julian Knight. His work involves determining whether those charged with acts of extreme violence are legally insane. Watson-Munro is regularly called upon to provide expert evidence in court and to the media.

Early life 
Watson-Munro has described being raised in a "privileged academic environment". His father was a professor of physics, and his mother a scientist. He was initially educated at Sydney Grammar School, where he left to work in a lumberyard due to the harsh disciplinary environment. Watson-Munro later returned to a different school to complete his secondary education. He then went on to study psychology at the University of Sydney.

Career 
Watson-Munro is described as one of Australia's leading and distinguished criminal psychologists. In 1978, he commenced his career at Paramatta Jail. He then went into private practice. He has assessed over 30,000 people in his career, including 200 murderers. Watson-Munro's primary role when assessing criminals is to determine whether they are legally insane.

Julian Knight 
Watson-Munro was the psychologist responsible for assessing and working with Julian Knight after he carried out the 1987 Hoddle Street massacre killing seven people and leaving 19 injured. Watson-Munro states the marksmanship during the massacre suggested clear thinking on the part of Knight.

Alphonse Gangitano 
Watson-Munro was assigned to treat now-deceased Melbourne underworld figure Alphonse Gangitano shortly after his arrest for murder. Gangitano was then released after the prosecution dropped all charges relating to the arrest after a key witness left the country, and Watson-Munro expected Gangitano not to pursue treatment. However shortly after his release, Gangitano contacted him for an appointment and treatment continued. Watson-Munro has written that Gangitano had a degree of "intellectual prowess", and that his time with Gangitano demonstrated to him that even career criminals can have "other lives that are seemingly quite normal".

Mr Cruel 
"Mr Cruel" is a pseudonym for the never identified suspect of several child rapes and the murder of Karmein Chan in Melbourne during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Watson-Munro was contracted by Victoria Police during their investigation to profile the potential offender.

Views 
Watson-Munro has advocated for educating to inform victims of crime about their rights to compensation and treatment.

Youth 
Watson-Munro in 1996 warned the child-welfare system in Victoria was in "chaos and on the brink of collapse", voicing concerns about the truancy and crime being committed by children in the care of the state and called for a royal commission into the government department responsible. Watson-Munro was involved in assessing a 14 year old boy who murdered a taxi driver while wandering around at night.

He has criticised a proposal to ban songs with suicidal themes as "censorship gone mad". He considers such proposals as well intentioned, but that real issues of youth suicide needed addressing such as socio economic circumstances.

Ivan Milat 
Watson-Munro has described serial killer Ivan Milat as a "malicious, calculating, psychopathic serial killer". Watson-Munro was approached to assess Milat but declined, stating "I had no interest in this bloke" and opined Milat had no hope of rehabilitation based on his crime and behaviour while in custody.

True crime 
Watson-Munro has stated that individuals who consume true crime media and are socially isolated, mentally ill, or young can become desensitised to violence and gore. He stated "I think there is a nexus between that and people viewing this material and becoming desensitised to it or wanting to see what it is like".

Controversy 
In 1999, Watson-Munro pleaded guilty to using and possessing cocaine. He was fined $1000 and placed on a 12 month good behaviour bond. He was later that year was reprimanded by the Psychologists Registration Board of Victoria on two counts of unprofessional misconduct after being found to have formed a personal relationship with a female client. In June 2000, the Board refused his re-registration as a psychologist. In 2002, the Board again found it was not in the public interest to allow Watson-Munro to practice. Watson-Munro has described the years preventing him from running a clinical practice as "the greatest challenge [he] ever faced". In 2003, Watson-Munro regained registration as a psychologist on the basis he undertook supervision for a period of two years.

Personal life 
Watson-Munro is married to his second wife, Carla. His first wife Susan died of cancer. He is the father of five children.

Works
Peru–Qatar relations are the bilateral relations between Peru and Qatar.  Both countries are members of the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement.

History
Both countries established relations in 1989. In 2011, Peru opened an embassy in Doha, with Qatar opening an embassy in Lima in response the following year. Starting in 2013, a series of high-level visits took place, with two emirs of Qatar and one president of Peru visiting each other's countries. During these visits, seven bilateral treaties were signed by both countries' heads of state.

Commercial relations were negatively affected by the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, as transport routes became limited due to the closure of the Gulf Cooperation Council's airspace to Qatari trade (with the exception of Kuwait and Oman).

In Peru, a parliamentary league of Peru–Qatari friendship operates under the Congress of Peru. As of 2023, the Peruvian community in Qatar consists of 157 people.

Oliver Sabel and Christian Mann are fictional characters from the German soap opera Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love), which was broadcast on Das Erste from 1995 to 2015. Portrayed by Jo Weil (Oliver) and Thore Schölermann (Christian), the characters were introduced seven years apart but rose to prominence as a same-sex supercouple. Weil later returned to play Oliver in the 2020–2021 revival series, Verbotene Liebe: Next Generation.

Weil and Schölermann were celebrated internationally for their cliché-free portrayal of a same-sex couple. Oliver and Christian's 2010 marriage was the first church wedding between two men ever dramatized on German television.

Appearances 
Jo Weil debuted on Verbotene Liebe as Oliver "Olli" Sabel on 31 December 1999. Olli is initially a supporting character with few lines of dialogue, but positive fan reaction prompted the writers to make Olli the nephew of a regular character. The role was Weil's first acting job after graduating from drama school. He played Olli until 3 September 2002, leaving to pursue other opportunities. Weil next appeared as paramedic Florian Lenz on the German series Medicopter 117 from 2003 to 2007. He said, "When they asked me to come back, they told me they were planning to create a new gay couple and [asked] if I would be interested in that. And if I was interested, they were going to make Christian gay ... it sounded like a good storyline to me, so I said why not." Weil returned to Verbotene Liebe on 2 November 2007 and remained until 6 February 2015, during the show's final season. From 2020 to 2021, Weil again played Olli in the revival series Verbotene Liebe: Next Generation.

Thore Schölermann portrayed Christian Mann from 27 November 2006 until 17 September 2013. It was his first major acting role. Schölermann took a leave of absence from the series in August 2012 to host the ProSieben music series The Voice of Germany. He initially explained that after finishing with Verbotene Liebe, he would be away until at least early 2013, and said "I owe a lot to this series and would be happy if the connection did not break." It was confirmed in February 2013 that Schölermann would not be returning to the series full-time, but temporary appearances were possible. He reprised the role briefly from 2 September to 17 September 2013.

Characterization 
Schölermann was initially surprised when he was told the writers would be making his straight character gay. He said, "I had to think about it because I wasn't sure if I could play a gay character truthfully or convincingly ... I was really afraid I couldn't do it". Schölermann took some inspiration from the 2005 film Brokeback Mountain, explaining "The movie showed how realistically and beautifully you can portray the love between two men". Acknowledging their chemistry, Weil said "We can be really proud of what we created and how much heart and energy and work we put into this story." Schölermann agreed, saying "It's important that we just not read the lines and do the scene. It's important to talk about what you want to do with the storyline and what you want to create." Both actors noted that though some touching and kissing between Olli and Christian is scripted, based on the scene they often take it upon themselves to add these intimacies, and "little things that you have when you are in a partnership". Elliot Robinson of So So Gay wrote, "This additional layer of tenderness really gives the couple a warmth and realness that has no doubt been instrumental in placing Christian and Olli in the hearts of many fans. Whereas a gay couple's kiss may in other soaps be written into a script as a deliberate plot device, such as prompting a homophobic reaction in a third party, Christian and Olli's continuous and observable closeness only adds to the believability of the couple's relationship."

After two years of their characters being a "happy couple", Weil and Schölermann said they liked the conflict of their 2010 storyline, in which Rob Marenbach (Max Engelke) and  Rebecca von Lahnstein (Jasmin Lord) try to come between Olli and Christian. Schölermann said, "For us it's so boring when we're happy. We like the drama and the conflict." Weil agreed, "When you're in a soap opera ... you have to keep it interesting." He added, "It's good to have some big issues to go through".

Storylines

1999–2002 
Oliver "Olli" Sabel is introduced in 1999 as an employee of the No Limits bar, and is later established to be the nephew of regular character Charlotte "Charlie" Schneider (Gabriele Metzger), the owner of the high-society bistro Schneiders in Düsseldorf. Identifying as bisexual, Olli begins dating medical student Tom Seifert (Kay Böger) in 2000. Olli's mother Henriette Sabel (Susanne Seuffert), Charlie's estranged sister, appears from 8 March to 12 March 2001 and disowns Olli over his same-sex relationship. Tom's ex-boyfriend Ulli Prozeski (Andreas Stenschke) briefly returns to town in 2001, creating tension between Tom and Oliver. Tom sleeps with Ulli, and Olli retaliates by sleeping with a woman. Tom and Olli's eventual breakup spins Olli's life out of control, culminating in a drug courier job that goes wrong. Olli leaves town in 2002 to become a steward on a cruise ship.

2006 
Christian Mann is established as the younger brother of Gregor Mann (Andreas Jancke). Newly released from prison, Christian had taken the blame for a gas station robbery committed by their gambling addict father, Wolfgang Mann (Jürgen Haug), who Christian believed could not survive prison due to a heart condition. Gregor and Christian's mother had committed suicide during their childhood, and their father died while Christian was incarcerated. In Düsseldorf, both Nico von Lahnstein (Verena Zimmermann) and Coco Faber (Mariangela Scelsi) are interested in newcomer Christian romantically, and Nico employs underhanded methods to get him for herself. He is sent back to prison for a time after being falsely accused of assaulting Nico's boss. Christian starts dating Nico, but breaks up with her and starts a relationship with Coco after discovering Nico's machinations.

2007–2009 
Olli returns to Düsseldorf, and meets Christian in the 8 November 2007 episode. Olli is invited to share a flat with Christian and Coco, who are having problems in their relationship. Christian reacts negatively after learning about Olli's sexuality, but later apologizes. Coco begins having feelings for Olli and kisses him, which they decide to keep a secret from Christian. Olli and Christian bond on a camping trip, and Christian opens up about his aspirations to be a boxer.  Olli agonizes over the fact that he is falling in love with Christian, knowing Christian is straight and dating Coco. In January 2008, Christian finds out about Olli and Coco's kiss and accuses Olli of pretending to be gay in order to steal his girlfriend. Olli goes to Christian's boxing club to clear up the misunderstanding. In the locker room, Olli confesses his feelings to Christian and surprises him with a kiss. Christian pushes him away, making it clear that he is straight.

Olli sends an application in Christian's name to a sports college, which angers Christian but also touches him. He begins dreaming and fantasizing about Olli's kiss and becomes confused about his sexuality. Christian breaks up with Coco and confesses his confusion, though he is still unwilling to admit he has developed feelings for Olli. Christian talks about his turmoil over his sexuality anonymously in a chat room with a man who turns out to be Olli. They eventually realize they are talking to each other, and the ensuing confrontation reveals their mutual romantic feelings. Olli and Christian sleep together for the first time on 17 March 2008. Afterward, Christian claims he was only testing his sexuality, and is now convinced he is not gay. He cannot stop thinking about Olli, however, and his track entrance trial at the sports college goes badly until Olli shows up to support him. Christian is overcome with jealousy when he sees Olli dancing with another man, and locks himself in his room. Olli waits outside the door all night, and in the morning they confess their feelings for each other. Olli and Christian have sex, and officially start to date on 4 April 2008.

Olli and Christian try to keep their relationship a secret, but they are soon found out by their flatmate, Judith Hagendorf (Katrin Heß), and Olli's cousin, Olivia Schneider (Kristina Dörfer). The women are supportive and promise to keep the secret. Christian gets a boxing contract, but soon fires his homophobic manager. He hires his brother Gregor, who is subsequently surprised to discover Christian and Olli in bed together, but is supportive of the relationship. Christian wants to come out publicly, but Olli is afraid this will damage Christian's boxing career before it even starts. After Christian wins his first professional fight against homophobe Axel, he comes out by kissing Olli in the ring. Axel brutally attacks Olli, and the charges are later dropped due to lack of evidence. Despite an apparent successful recovery, Olli develops an aneurysm as a result of the attack and undergoes brain surgery to save his life. He survives, and the injury gives the police enough evidence to arrest Axel. Some time later, Christian collapses, and is diagnosed with myocarditis, a bacterial infection which has spread to his heart muscle. The news that this condition prevents him from participating in any kind of professional sport is a blow to Christian. His cousin Stella Mann (Anne Wis) notices that he has a gift for taming horses, and he begins training at Castle Köningsbrunn as a professional horse trainer.

2010–2014 
In 2010, Olli and Christian's relationship is challenged again by the arrival of Rob Marenbach (Max Engelke), an event planner who is interested in seducing Olli. Rob's events at Olli's bar, No Limits, are a front for his drug dealing operation. Olli dismisses Christian's suspicions as jealousy. When the bar is raided for suspected drug activity, Olli accuses a furious Christian of arranging it. Their relationship is further strained when Olli begins to suspect Christian is attracted to women again, after Christian shares a drunken kiss with Miriam Pesch (Romina Becks) and is then kissed by a lovesick  Rebecca von Lahnstein (Jasmin Lord). Olli confronts him, and Christian admits he is not sure if he is attracted to women. They consider breaking up, but soon reconcile thanks to a romantic trip to New York.

When Christian is rushed to the hospital with chest pain and the doctor excludes Olli because he is not a relative, Miriam suggests to Olli that they get married. Olli proposes in July 2010, and a shocked Christian accepts. Olli's ex-boyfriend Jonas appears and tells Olli that he is HIV positive and may have infected Olli when they were together. Christian is reassuring, but Olli is fearful that not only does he have the virus, but he may have given it to Christian. After an agonizing wait, they learn that Olli is negative. Christian proposes to Olli himself, and asks that they marry right away. Olli's mother Henriette comes to terms with his sexuality and they reconcile. Olli and Christian are married in a church wedding on 6 September 2010.

Christian and Olli decide to have a child, but face obstacles with adoption and surrogacy. They foster a young girl named Lily, and are devastated when she is reunited with her father. This puts a strain on the relationship, and after Christian parties with Andi Fritzsche (Dominic Saleh-Zaki) and Jessica Stiehl (Jana Julie Kilka), Jessica claims that both men had sex with her. This triggers Olli's fears about Christian's sexuality, and he asks Christian to move out. Christian lives at the stud farm in Königsbrünn until a fire destroys all his possessions. He is forced to move in with Charlie, directly across from Olli's apartment. In 2011, Olli witnesses Phillip zu Hohenfelden (Stephan Käfer) being hit by a car and falls into depression. Christian starts an affair with Theresa Erzberger (Eva Luca Klemmt), a coworker at the stud farm, but later breaks up with her. Olli attempts a relationship with Rafael Velasquez (Marc Philipp), whom he had met on vacation. Eventually Olli and Christian decide to dissolve their marriage. Christian consoles himself in the boxing ring battling against a friend of Axel's, and Olli arrives just in time to witness Christian have a heart attack. In shock, Olli wanders out as paramedics seem unable to revive Christian. Believing Christian dead, Olli realizes he is not in love with Rafael and breaks up with him. Olli goes to the hospital to see Christian's body, but is overjoyed to learn that Christian survived. Overcome with love for each other, they reunite. Olli and Christian remarry on 3 January 2012 in the cabin where they fell in love in 2008.

In late 2012, Christian accepts a job working with a world renowned horse trainer for several months in the United Kingdom. During his absence, Charlie tries to stop Arno Brandner (Konrad Krauss), who is dying from Alzheimer's disease, from writing a letter to Olli revealing he has a half-sister from his father's extra-marital affair. Olli finds the letter after Arno's death, and with information from Clarissa von Anstetten (Isa Jank) is able to find his sister, Bella Jacob (Janina Isabell Batoly). Charlie ultimately confesses to being Bella's mother.

Christian returns in September 2013, but tells Olli he intends to extend his work contract in the UK for another year. The strain this puts on their marriage is made worse by Christian's confession that he had a one-night stand with a woman when he was drunk in England. Olli is devastated that Christian has been unfaithful with a woman yet again, and claims to want a commitment-free open marriage. Though this makes Christian jealous, as intended, Olli is unable to go through with sleeping with another man. Olli begins distancing himself from Christian and ignoring his repeated apologies. Believing their relationship is truly over, Christian books a flight back to the UK. Before he can leave, Jessica locks him and Olli in their room to force them to talk. Christian professes his love for Olli, who finally forgives him. Olli agrees to accompany Christian to England for a short period. Olli returns to Germany, but visits Christian a few more times. The relationship is once again strained by their busy lives and distance apart. When Christian fails to come to Düsseldorf as planned, ruining Olli's surprise party, Olli gets drunk and has a one-night stand with another man. He confesses to Christian and travels to the UK to talk things out. Olli returns to Düsseldorf and announces their divorce. In June 2014, Olli receives divorce papers from Christian's lawyers, and signs them.

Next Generation (2020–2021)
Olli is dating Paul Verhoven (Lennart Betzgen) the 2020–2021 revival series Verbotene Liebe: Next Generation. In episode eight, Olli tells Charlie that he and Christian have remained friends.

Reception 
Verbotene Liebe received international attention in 2008 with the love story of Olli and Christian. The Berliner Kurier noted that Weil and Schölermann were celebrated internationally for their cliché-free portrayal of a same-sex couple, and Refresh called the characters "the world's most popular gay couple" in 2008. The same year, US publication Soap Opera Weekly said that, thanks to Olli and Christian, Verbotene Liebe was "hands-down" their readers' favorite foreign language soap opera. In 2010, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that "Christian and Olli have become cult figures in Germany and globally", and Variety also noted that the couple has attracted a cult following.  AfterElton noted Olli and Christian's "worldwide legion of fans", and in 2013 Elliot Robinson of So So Gay wrote that thanks to the positive reception by audiences, Olli and Christian "have gone on to become a central and enduringly popular couple for the show." In 2019, Michael Patterson of What Culture wrote, "One of German TV's most revolutionary LGBT storylines, soap opera Verbotene Liebe made headlines for its authentic portrayal of the romance between Oliver Sabel and Christian Mann. The series had already received some attention for breaking ground with Olli's previous relationships, but it was this one that garnered international attention".

The Olli and Christian romance attracted attention in the United States when German fans put clips of the story online with English subtitles. Weil said he and Schölermann became aware of their characters' popularity outside Germany first through emails from American fans, and then letters. After a fan told Weil about the online videos, he noted that "We slowly realized the impact of all that. And yeah, we couldn't believe it." Weil said, "Then suddenly the snowball system started, French and Spanish subtitles were added in addition to the English. By the time we found out about it, there were already hundreds of thousands of clicks on these videos in languages that we didn't even know existed." Schölermann called American fans "more intense" and "more passionate" than German fans. Weil said of the difference, "I think our storyline touches people in a different way [in the US]. In Germany, people are used to gay storylines on television so it doesn't move people as much, but [in the US] it's still very special that you can see a gay couple in such a normal way and I think that's what moves many people and makes them have such a big reaction."

American viewers in particular "reacted with unbridled enthusiasm" to the storyline, recognizing that Verbotene Liebe "not only didn't hesitate to show same-sex affection, but allowed its gay characters' storylines the same prominence as the heterosexual ones." This was in contrast to the storyline unfolding at the time on the American soap opera As the World Turns of Luke Snyder and Noah Mayer, two gay characters who had been together for a year and still had not consummated their relationship. In 2008, Alexander Stevenson of Logo TV suggested that American serials "until very recently frequently treated gay content with kid gloves for fear of offending advertisers." On Verbotene Liebe, Olli and Christian are shown to have sex even though they are still unsure of their feelings for each other. Stevenson noted that other characters in the series are shown for the most part to be accepting of Olli and Christian's relationship, as a result of "Germany's more casual attitude toward gay people". In 2013, Verbotene Liebe was called "a beacon of LGBT inclusivity on an international level" amid the popularity of Olli and Christian.

Robinson wrote in 2013, "If you wish to watch a gay couple's story unfold and evolve, you would struggle to find a better one than that of Christian and Oliver. In addition to the well-rounded characters and significant stories they have been part of, what really sets them apart is their portrayal." He noted that, aside from the introductory plot of a straight man realizing he is bisexual and in love with a man, "Verbotene Liebe has never sensationalised the couple's presence. Their relationship is treated like any other in the show, with all the surrounding cast treating them, quite rightly, in a normalised fashion ... However, what really helps take this TV couple to the next level is the acting and, in particular, the chemistry between Thore and Jo." Weil and Schölermann said they rarely get negative reactions to their characters. Weil said, "Most of the time we get very positive reactions. Even people who say 'I'm straight, and I usually don't like gay characters, but we like watching this couple' ... They just see two people in love. It's not all about their sex." Patterson explained in 2019, "Christian and Olli's tale was one without stereotypes that ultimately educated international audiences on the fact that sometimes men can just fall in love with other men and, in doing so, they can live happily ever after."

Schölermann teased Olli and Christian's wedding, saying "Nothing like it has happened on German television before." The marriage, presided over by guest star Dirk Bach and livestreamed, was the first church wedding between two men ever dramatized on German television. Weil said, "Who would have thought three years ago that Olli and Chris would actually one day make the bond for life. I think that this event is a particularly great thank you for all our fans worldwide ... Maybe with our love story we can convince a few more people that love knows neither borders nor genders."

In February 2010, Sam Martin of American production company Aid & Abet acquired the rights to adapt the Olli and Christian storyline in the US, changing the setting from Düsseldorf to Portland, Oregon. In 2011, Olli and Christian won a German Soap Award for Most Beautiful Couple, and Weil received the Fan Award Male. Weil won the Fan Award Male again in 2012.
Fans and the press sometimes refer to the duo by the portmanteau "Chrolli", (for Christian and Olli), or "Ollian".
The Corn Exchange is a market hall and events venue in the Market Street, Exeter, Devon, England. It was designed by the city architect, Harold Rowe and completed in 1960.

History
The current building was commissioned to replace a structure known as the "Lower Market" which was bounded by Fore Street, Market Street, Guinea Street and Milk Street. The Lower Market was designed by Charles Fowler in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone and was officially opened on 9 December 1836. The principal rooms were a long colonnaded main hall which was used as a butchers' market and a room, above the main entrance in Guinea Street, which operated as a corn exchange. The Lower Market was badly damaged by German bombing in the Baedeker Blitz on 4 May 1942 during the Second World War and was consequently demolished in the late 1950s.

The new building was designed by the city architect, Harold Rowe, in the Modernist style, built in concrete and glass and was opened as "St George's Hall" in 1960. The design involved a main frontage in three sections facing onto Market Street. The central section featured a tall brick structure with diamond-shaped decoration, to which the city coat of arms was fixed at first floor level, flanked by full-height concrete pillars supporting a perforated beam. The three-storey side sections were faced with alternating bands of blue panelling and glass. Internally, the principal rooms were a market hall on the ground floor and an events venue on the first floor. The architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, was unimpressed with the design and described it as "a rather tatty effort in a belated Festival of Britain spirit".

The events venue on the first floor was a popular venue in the 1970s and 1980s: performers included the rock band, Thin Lizzy in February 1972, the rock band, New Model Army, in May 1985 and the pub rock band, Dr. Feelgood in November 1989.

Following a refurbishment in 2007, the building was re-branded as the "Corn Exchange" recalling one of the uses of the earlier structure on the site. The works, which cost £1.8 million, involved improvements to the auditorium on the first floor as well as the conversion of the ground floor into a sustainable "food emporium". In January 2020, Exeter City Council confirmed that it was considering making further improvements to the Corn Exchange as an alternative to a commissioning a completely new venue for major public events in the city. One of the episodes of the BBC New Comedy Award was held at the venue in 2022.
"" (If our mouth were full of song) is a Christian hymn with text by Eugen Eckert, written in 1999, and a melody by Alejandro Veciana. The text is derived from a Jewish text. A hymn of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied, it is part of regional sections of the common German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob, and of other songbooks.

History 
The text of "" was written by the Protestant theologian and minister Eugen Eckert from Frankfurt, derived from a prayer in Hebrew, "Nischmat Kol Chaj" from Festtägliches Gebetbuch (the Frankfurt Haggadah) of 1892. The melody was created the same year by . It was first published in the choral collection Die Zeit färben (Colour the time). It was intended to preserve memory of Jewish life in Frankfurt.

The song, of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied, appeared in regional sections of the common German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob, in the Diocese of Limburg as GL 814. It is part of many other hymnals and songbooks.

Text and music 
The song "" is in four stanzas which all end with the same four lines that express that however we try to praise God, it is still not enough to cover his greatness ("so reichte es nicht, dich, Gott, unsern Gott, recht zu loben", in English: "it would still not suffice to praise you, God, our God, in the right way"). The beginning four lines of the stanzas imagine ways to praise God, in the first stanza songs filling the mouth like the sea and its roaring, in the second stanza sparkle in the eyes and dancing feet, in the third stanza hands streched out like eagles wings, and in the last stanza trying to name all occurrences of Gods goodness.

The melody by Veciana begins in E minor and a 6/8 metre. Most phrases begin with a long note of 3 or more often 4 eighth notes, followed by movements in eighth notes. The refrain is in G major, but ends openly. The repeated call in the refrain, "dich, Gott" ("you, God") is a leap upwards of a fifth to D, the highest note which is held for more than one measure.
The Battle of Chapakchur or Defense of Chapakchur was a significant military engagement that took place during World War I in 1916. It occurred as part of the larger campaign in the region between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The battle is notable for the actions of Mustafa Kemal, who later became known as Atatürk, and his role in rescuing Colonel Ali Fuat Bey from a precarious situation at the Çapakçur Pass.

Battle 
At the time, Colonel Ali Fuat Bey was tasked with defending the Çapakçur Pass against superior Russian forces. Despite his valiant efforts, Ali Fuat Bey's division found themselves outnumbered and surrounded by the enemy. The situation was precarious, and the division had already suffered significant losses.

When Mustafa Kemal, the commander of the 16th Army Corps, received news of Ali Fuat Bey's predicament, he immediately took action. Without waiting for permission from higher authorities, Mustafa Kemal swiftly organized the 7th Division from Muş and launched a counterattack to rescue Ali Fuat Bey's division.

Mustafa Kemal's forces launched a fierce assault on the flank of the Russian troops, catching them off guard and disrupting their positions. The Turkish troops fought pushing back the enemy and relieving the pressure on Ali Fuat Bey's division.

The battle was intense and hard-fought, with both sides engaging in fierce combat. However, thanks to Mustafa Kemal's strategic maneuvers of his troops, they managed to turn the tide of the battle. The Turkish forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian troops and successfully defended the Çapakçur Pass.

"Four Kinds of Horses" is a song by English-musician Peter Gabriel, released in May 2023 as the fifth single in promotion of his upcoming tenth studio album I/O. The track has been described as atmospheric, swirling, and sparkling.

The song was originally conceived when the founder of XL Recordings Richard Russell asked Peter Gabriel to make a song for his project "Everything Is Recorded", while in the studio Gabriel "came up with some chords, melodies and words on top of a groove he was working on", which, with help from Russel, would eventually become "Four Kinds of Horses".

As the track developed, a couple of things would influence the track, such as the Buddhist Parable of Four Kinds of Horses, which explain how a student can approach religious and spiritual practice. The song also shows themes of "the interesting overlap of religion and peace on the one hand and violence and terrorism on the other. There was also a wonderful film by Hany Abu-Assad called ‘Paradise Now’ which shows two young men who end up being trained to become terrorists and it’s a real insight into where the head goes.”

The track also features Brian Eno on synths, who first worked with Gabriel on 1992's Us, Composer John Metcalfe on string arrangements, and Gabriel's daughter Melanie on backing vocals.

The cover artwork was done by Cornelia Parker.

 Peter Gabriel – vocals, backing vocals, synths
 David Rhodes – guitars, backing vocals
 Tony Levin – basses
 Melanie Gabriel – backing vocals

"Watching and Dreaming" is the series finale of the American animated television series The Owl House. The episode served as the third and final episode of the third season, and the 43rd episode of the series overall. The episode was written by show creator Dana Terrace and John Bailey Owen, and directed by Bosook Coburn and Bridget Underwood. It originally aired on April 8, 2023, on both Disney Channel and Disney XD, and was released on the former channel's official YouTube channel and Disney+ afterwards.

The episode received a combined viewing audience of 500,000 viewers and received a 0.09 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. It received praise from critics for its writing, themes, action sequences, use of time, animation, musical score, ending sequence, and emotional weight. The episode was also relatively praised as a satisfying conclusion to the show with the constraints the show had to endure, but the episode was also seen as one that had cut numerous storylines and character development in order to fit in with a shortened third season.

Plot 
Continuing from the events of "For the Future", Luz Noceda is separated from her friends and mother after the Collector puts her, Eda, and King in their personal nightmares. Luz finds herself on Emperor Belos' throne and finds everyone she knows from the Boiling Isles petrified before being attacked by her friends, who are being puppeteered with the Collector's magic. With help from her friends as they briefly resist, Luz eventually breaks the Collector's spell, and frees Eda and King with light glyphs. The Collector is upset by the outcome as Belos, who is controlling Raine Whispers' body, suggests killing the trio. The Collector refuses since he wants to befriend them while revealing that his magic is ineffective against Titans. He also reveals, that the heart of the Titan whose body became the Boiling Isles is still beating and located in Belos's castle. Belos convinces the Collector to play with Luz, Eda, and King in person so he can reach the heart.

The Collector accepts the offer and challenges the three to a variety of games, only to repeatedly lose to them. The Collector eventually confides in Luz, saying that all he wanted was a friend that would not lie to him. He reveals that his siblings, the Archivists, sent him to the Demon Realm to live and "play" with the Titans, along with observing them. But the Archivists drove the Titans to extinction upon deeming them a threat, resulting in the Collector being sealed by King's father for association. A sympathetic Luz comforts the Collector as she, Eda, and King take him to the Owl House and various sites of their past adventures to help him understand true friendship.

At the same time, Belos reaches his castle before Raine breaks the Collector's spell and purges Belos out of their body. But despite Raine's attempt to stop him, Belos merges with the Titan's heart and begins to infect the Boiling Isles with his spores. Luz's group rushes to Belos's castle. The Collector tries to reason with Belos, inspired by Luz's friendship lessons, only to be horrified when Luz dies shielding him from Belos's attack. The Collector is confused by his sadness when he fails to revive Luz while Eda and King are consumed in a fit of rage as they attack Belos.

Luz's spirit ends up in the In-Between World and is saved from sinking into the afterlife by King's father, who has been observing her and King. He then helps a despondent Luz understand that Belos is too consumed in his delusions to act with any real good intention, offering the girl his remaining lifeforce to stop Belos before he could fully consume the Boiling Isles. Luz accepts and revives herself. At the same time, Eda and King fight Belos in a losing battle while the Collector breaks down, guilt-ridden and confused, apologizing for everything he has done. The three are saved by the revived Luz, joined by Eda and King as they fight their way to the Titan's heart while the Collector protects the Archive House.

An enraged Luz, Eda, and King break into Belos' demon shell, rescuing Raine and removing Belos from the Titan's heart. A severely weakened Belos assumes his human guise while appealing to Luz by claiming he was acting under a curse. Luz refuses to listen as downpour of boiling rain reduces Belos to a muck-covered skull, with Luz walking away as Belos fails to guilt trip her into saving him. Eda, Raine, and King arrive and spitefully stomp on his remains, killing him for good. As the Titan's spirit departs, the Collector succeeds in saving the Archive House with help from Gus, Amity, Willow and Hunter, winning their friendship. While everyone on the archipelago reunites, they realize that they will need to completely rebuild the Boiling Isles. The Collector returns to the stars to do some "growing up", but promises to return in the future. Luz finds out that the Titan's complete death means she can no longer use his glyph magic.

Four years after Belos' defeat, Vee and Luz have graduated high school and Luz is going to college on the Boiling Isles. The Nocedas have purchased the abandoned house in the middle of the woods, which now has a new portal door to the Boiling Isles made by the Collector. Willow plays flyer derby at a professional level, and Hunter is a professional palisman carver. Amity has become an Abomination engineer, while Lilith has become an architect. Eda is headmaster of the university Luz is attending, which teaches wild magic, with Gus and Edric as part of the staff, the former teaching human culture. As she enters the Boiling Isles, Luz receives a surprise quinceañera from her friends after having to miss her initial one due to her spending her last three birthdays rebuilding the Boiling Isles. King shows Luz that his growing Titan powers allow him to create his own glyph language. The Collector presents Luz and her friends with a light show while passing through and Luz thanks Eda and King for everything. In the final scene of the series, all characters come together and say "Bye!" to the departing Collector and the audience.

Production 
According to show creator Dana Terrace, numerous scenes and storylines were cut due to Disney Television Animation cutting the season down to three episodes instead of a usual 20-episode season. According to an article by the Connecticut Insider, the sudden cutting of the season forced the show's creators to insert storylines that the creators had previously debated.

Disney Television Animation's decision to cut the season down to three episodes received mainly negative attention. Vanity Fair writer Emily St. James said that the series' "LGBTQ+ representation" caused the series to shut down despite the show's popularity. St. James would also say that the series served as a sign that American children's television had decreasing representation of LGBTQ+ people, following the cancellations of other American animated television shows, such as Steven Universe. Dana Terrace had denied that this was the cause, revealing during a Reddit AMA that it was due to a variety of factors that were beyond her control, though she has admitted that if Disney Television Animation had different people in charge, the show would have most likely lasted longer.

Three weeks after the episode aired, selected voice actors and writers for the show gave an interview on Instagram. During the interview, Terrace publicly stated that she had wanted to include Hooty more, along with wanting to expand the storylines of The Collector more. She would go on to state that two characters, Willow Park and Hunter, were made with the intention that they were pansexual and bisexual, respectively. Terrace also admitted that most of the second season was written without prior notice of the shortening of the third season, leading to several major storylines being cut from the third season. Terrace also stated that she would like to see a sequel made, but the decision to make a sequel is not up to her control, as The Walt Disney Company owns the intellectual property of The Owl House.

Promotion 
On March 22, 2023, The Walt Disney Company released an official one-minute trailer for the episode, featuring Luz and her friends battling against both The Collector and Emperor Belos. The trailer featured Luz reuniting with her mentor, Eda Clawthorne, and The Collector and Emperor Belos plotting an attack against Luz and her friends.

On April 3, the official poster for the episode, made by Terrace in collaboration with artist Andy Garner–Flexner, was released.

Right before the episode officially aired, Disney Channel aired a montage of clips from previous episodes, thanking viewers for watching the series.

Critical reception

Ratings 
This episode was watched by 375,000 viewers on Disney Channel and a combined audience of 500,000 viewers including the simulcast on Disney XD, currently making it both the most viewed Disney Channel and Disney XD premiere in 2023, beating "For the Future", another episode of The Owl House.

Reviews 
Writer for TheGamer, Jade King, gave the episode a highly positive review, calling it "an extended dream sequence/kaiju battle/time skip that did everything it could to wrap up loose ends and leave us smiling as the credits rolled... beneath it all, core themes still managed to resonate and leave us with a message that is both bittersweet and poignant." King would praise the redemption arc for The Collector and the episode's messages, saying "The Owl House leaves us with a mantra of guilt, forgiveness, and love woven through a passage of time that stops for nobody. Clear in how we must savour each moment as it comes and recognise that making mistakes and surrendering to our emotions is precisely what makes us human... we are all worth something."

Writer for TV Source Magazine, Lee Arvoy, gave the episode a relatively positive review, but said the episode was limited in terms of character development and involvement. Speaking on the topic of Luz's friends, he said that "I wish we were able to have more of Amity, Willow, Luz and Hunter involved in the main story. They felt a bit disconnected from the main story... I felt that Hunter especially should have had more of an involvement in finally taking down Belos. His whole existence and place in the world were linked to him."

Writer for Polygon, Petrana Radulovic, wrote that "The Owl House gave us almost everything that it could've in its limited three episode final season — and also gave us a gut-punch in the finale that is going to stick with us for some time." Writer for Comic Book Resources, Marc York, wrote that "For the most part, TOH handled being cut short with grace and dignity. It still managed to flesh out the characters that really needed it, cover a lot of major plot points if not all of them, and give just about everyone a well-deserved happy ending. The action was also pretty great."

Writer for Collider, Emily Kavanagh, praised how the finale was able to handle both Emperor Belos and The Collector as villains and the nuance of forgiveness and redemption. Writer for The Pop Break, Avani Goswami, ranked that show's finale alongside the finale of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power and said that "it's bittersweet to say goodbye to a top-tier animated series that feels like a warm hug or cup of tea, but the ending proves just why the show will always be memorable, and it's so nice to see the characters' bright futures. To anyone wanting to share in a magical adventure that will make you smile, The Owl House is definitely worth a shot. It's a heartwarming series from beginning to end, and one that makes all viewers wish they could step through the door to the Boiling Isles once again for the very first time."

Writer for Autostraddle, Heather Hogan, wrote, "The series ended this weekend, triumphantly and unapologetically queer, just like its creator, Dana Terrace. And it did so as LGBTQ+ youth and trans people of all ages are under cultural and legislative attack in the United States like never before. 'Watching and Dreaming' would always have been a triumph — to close out a story with so many beloved characters, and such deep mythology, in a truncated final season mandated by spineless Disney execs is no small task — but doing so in a time of so much violence aimed at gay and trans kids feels like the firm planting of a beacon of hope." Writer for Out, Mey Rude said that "It was a perfectly fitting ending for a show that ended up changing a lot of young people's lives."

The Sürgü Fault Zone (Sürgü Fay Zonu) is a major fault zone in south-central Anatolia. It contains the Sürgü fault. Rupture on this fault caused the second major (M>7) earthquake during the 2023 Gaziantep-Kahramanmaraş earthquakes that started in February 2023.

The fault zone extends (west to east) from Göksun to Çelikhan where it merges into the East Anatolian Fault.
It is a "major fault recognized in the field" of geosciences and "was known to be capable of very significant earthquakes" such as in 1544 and 1986. As of 2023 it has been estimated to have an activated length of about .

During the 2023 Gaziantep-Kahramanmaraş earthquakes, the Sürgü Fault experienced a major earthquake of 7.6, which was followed by many aftershocks along the active length of the faultline.
And the Winner Is... is the fourth independent LP record by Tejano music group Selena y Los Dinos. It was released in April 1987 under Manny Guerra's GP Productions. The title alludes to the multitude of accolades Selena garnered since her entry into the music industry. And the Winner Is... was unveiled with the objective of expanding the Tejano audience that the band had recently enthralled. Among the album's singles, "La Bamba" represented Selena's initial appearance on a national music chart, reaching its peak at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart in August 1987. Concurrently, Selena's rendition was released around the same time as Los Lobos', which supported the eponymous film. As Selena y Los Dinos was a relatively obscure group, their version began to wane on the chart as Los Lobos' version climbed. And the Winner Is... garnered favorable reception from music critics, with Tim Baker of Newsweek observing the group's gradual elimination of their characteristic doo-wop sound from prior recordings. While And the Winner Is... secured a nomination for Album of the Year at the 1988 Tejano Music Awards, Selena won Female Vocalist of the Year, her second consecutive win.

Background 
In the aftermath of the 1981 recession in Texas, former musician Abraham Quintanilla, endeavored to propel his children's band Selena y Los Dinos as a means of achieving financial stability following their eviction from their home. The ensemble comprised Selena as the lead vocalist, A. B. Quintanilla as the bassist and producer, and Suzette Quintanilla on drums. The group's roster subsequently expanded to incorporate Ricky Vela on keyboards and Roger Garcia on guitar. The group's first album, Alpha (1986) provided the band with "Dame un Beso", their first commercially acclaimed single. This success was succeeded by their rendition of Jimmy Charles' composition "A Million to One" (1986), which garnered the distinction of being the most frequently played track on the KEDA radio station in San Antonio, Texas. "Dame un Beso" and "A Million to One" contributed to Selena securing the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987. The 15-year-old's win supplanted the genre's leading lady, Laura Canales, eliciting astonishment among those present.

And the Winner Is... was released in April 1987, with the title alluding to the numerous accolades Selena accrued since her entry into the music industry. Selena's biographer, Joe Nick Patoski, opined that "[Selena] wasn't just a winner, but a winner who knew how to win with grace and humility." Scholar Deborah Vargas posited that the album's title, devoid of irony, signified that "from the time she received her first award until her death, Selena would become a dominant fixture at annual awards shows in Texas." Abraham selected the album's title as a means of asserting mainstream significance while concurrently reverting to his Tejano origins. The album cover portrays Selena "proudly holding" the Female Vocalist of the Year accolade from the 1987 Tejano Music Awards. The album encompassed a selection of original compositions, in addition to renditions of traditional Mexican songs. And the Winner Is... was released with the intention of augmenting the Tejano audience the band had recently captivated.

Reception and media appearances 
The album encompassed "La Bamba", a pop cover of Ritchie Valens 1957 song, which was released as a single in the summer of 1987. Tim Baker of Newsweek characterized the track as a "clubbified remix". Patoski regarded Selena's concluding query in the song, "am I bothering you?", as enigmatic. "La Bamba" emerged as the most memorable track off And the Winner Is..., and was released in the wake of the success of Miami Sound Machine. Valens and Trini Lopez, who recorded the song in 1963, each achieved sales of 1,000,000 copies for their respective renditions of "La Bamba". Abraham aspired for some of their enchantment to "rub off [on Selena]". Patoski observed that the group revitalized "La Bamba" with a "semi-salsified interpretation". Concurrently, Selena's songs received airplay on Texas radio stations at an average frequency of once every 30 minutes. "La Bamba" entered the US Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart in August 1987, marking Selena y Los Dinos' inaugural appearance on a music chart; it eventually peaked at number 20. Selena's version was released around the same time as Los Lobos' rendition, which supported the film La Bamba (1987). Abraham recollected how A. B. was unable to rival Hollywood, and the group's version began to decline on the chart as Los Lobos ascended; "we were an unknown group, they knocked us away," Abraham later remarked. The album also featured the sentimental ballads "Cuando Nadie Te Quiera", a cover of Mexican singer-songwriter, Jose Alfredo Jimenez, and the Vela-penned "Tu No Sabes". A music video for "Tu No Sabes" was shot at the Martin Weiss Park in Oak Cliff, bolstering her fan base in the region. The video was captured by Gilberto Cortez using a camcorder, while the song played through a boombox. And the Winner Is... was nominated for Album of the Year, while Selena won Female Vocalist of the Year at the 1988 Tejano Music Awards. According to Baker, the group was gradually eradicating their usual doo-wop sound from their repertoire in And the Winner Is...

On April 26, 1987, Selena rendered a performance of "La Bamba" on the Johnny Canales Show in Matamoros, Mexico. Patoski characterized her attire as an evolution from her space suit at the Tejano Music Awards to a "silver, sparkling matadora outfit" which signaled a "tinge of sexuality". Nonetheless, Patoski noted that Selena's choreography remained minimalistic and rudimentary, with sporadic hip-swaying. This performance was dramatized by Christian Serratos as Selena in the Netflix two-part limited drama, Selena: The Series (2020-21). The episode "And the Winner Is..." derives its title from the album. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, ranked And the Winner Is... as the thirteenth preeminent album released by Selena. In 2007, Abraham released Classic Series Vol. 3, remastered tracks of And the Winner Is... under his Q-Zone Records label. On August 26, 2022, "Salta La Ranita" was released as a single off of Moonchild Mixes (2022). The cumbia track "Salta La Ranita", was contemporized and remixed for the album. The animated music video, described by Ariana Garcia of the Houston Chronicle, as "vibrant and colorful", portrays a frog wedding at which Selena is invited to perform. The music video elicited a mixed response from fans; while some believed the video could introduce a younger demographic to her music, others contended that Selena's family was exploiting the singer for monetary gain. Mariam M. Echevarría Báez of El Vocero has drawn a parallel between the comedic essence of "La Carcacha" (1992) and that of "Salta La Ranita". Guerra called "Salta La Ranita" an energetic and "silly" cumbia track.

The Hamp Airport (FAA LID: 68R) is a privately owned, public use airport located  west of Elwell, Michigan. The airport sits on  of land at an elevation of .

History 
The airport is owned by Harold Hamp, a local pilot and mechanic. Hamp and his son have a maintenance shop at the airport to work on a variety of aircraft.

Hamp's first airport was built in 1981. After Hamp made aircraft maintenance his full-time career, he got the airport approved for public use so people could fly their planes in to his maintenance shop. The airport has sense been used for transient aircraft and skydiving operations.

Facilities and aircraft 
The airport has one runway, designated as Runway 9/27. It measures  and is made of turf. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2020, the airport has 150 aircraft operations per year, an average of just over 12 per month. These movements consisted entirely of general aviation. For the same time period, 4 aircraft were based at the airport, all single-engine airplanes.

The airport does not have a fixed-base operator, and no fuel is available.

Accidents and incidents 

 On June 26, 1993, a Piper PA-24 crashed after takeoff from Hamp Airport, coming down in a field less than a mile from the airport. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the improper use of the fuel selector by the pilot, resulting in fuel starvation.
 On September 3, 2006, a Luscombe 8A nosed over while landing at Hamp Airport. The aircraft was high on approach and the pilot entered a slip to lose altitude, but the aircraft touched down more than halfway down the runway. The pilot applied brakes to stop on the runway and the airplane nosed over. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot's excessive braking after he failed to attain the proper touchdown point and failed to perform a go-around.

Barcelona is a coastal city located in Catalonia, Spain and it is a major contributor to food waste. Every year, tons of perfectly good food is discarded or thrown away by consumers and businesses, often ending up in landfills and contributing to environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.

Food loss vs food waste 
Food loss and food waste both refer to food that is discarded or not consumed, but they have different meanings and implications.

Food loss refers to the decrease in quantity or quality of food that occurs along the food supply chain from production to retail. This can be due to a variety of factors such as poor harvesting techniques, inadequate storage facilities, transportation problems, and market inefficiencies. Food loss typically occurs in developing countries where the infrastructure for food storage, transportation, and processing is inadequate.

Food waste, on the other hand, refers to food that is discarded or thrown away by consumers, retailers, and food service providers. This can occur due to a variety of reasons such as overproduction, expiration dates, and cosmetic imperfections. Food waste typically occurs in developed countries where there is an abundance of food and a culture of over-consumption.

While both food loss and food waste have negative environmental and economic impacts, food waste is generally considered to be easily preventable and less justifiable. This is because food waste occurs mainly due to consumer behavior and decisions, whereas food loss is often caused by factors outside of the consumer's control.

Global food waste 
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines food waste as food appropriate for human consumption being discarded. The FAO reported that around one-third of all food produced for human consumption (1.3 billion tons) is lost and wasted across the entire supply chain every year, with an estimated value of USD $936 billion. The amount of FLW varies between countries and is influenced by factors such as level of income, urbanization, and economic growth. In less-developed countries, FLW occurs mainly in the post-harvest and processing stage, while in developed countries, a significant portion occurs in the consumption stage, driven mostly by consumer behavior, values, and attitudes. FLW has serious environmental, economic, poverty, and natural resource impacts, including contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and decreased availability of food for human consumption. FLW reduction initiatives could improve food prices, efficiency in the supply chain, and access to nutritious foods for vulnerable households.

National governments and international entities are introducing policies to reduce food waste. The United Nations has set a target to cut food waste in half by 2030, and the European Commission has committed to achieving this goal as part of its Circular Economy Action Plan. To support this, the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste was established to help prevent food waste and share best practices. In order to reduce food waste, it's important to accurately account for it throughout the food supply chain. However, there is currently no standardized way to do this. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission organized a workshop to discuss how to harmonize and improve food waste accounting methodologies. Experts identified several research gaps, such as the need for clear and consistent definitions and terminology, improved data quality, and identifying drivers of food waste. These improvements will help policymakers better design policies to reduce food waste.

Food waste in Barcelona 
In Catalonia, people consume 3.74 million tonnes of solid food every year, which amounts to 499 kg per person. However, 1.18 million tonnes of food are discarded as waste. 920,577 tonnes include unavoidable waste such as vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and fish bones. The remaining 262,471 tonnes is classified as food wastage. This is equivalent to 7% of the total solid food products acquired by homes, restaurants, and shops in Catalonia, which is 34.9 kg per person per year. This amount of food wastage is enough to feed over 500,000 people for a year. Home kitchens are responsible for the majority of food wastage, around 58% (151,800 tonnes), followed by supermarkets and grocery stores (16%), bars and restaurants (12%), retail food sector (9%), institutional catering and restaurant services (4%), and municipal markets (1%).

Barcelona's comparative position 

2010 estimates show that Spain had about 135kg of food waste per capita, the 17th highest in Europe.   However, these numbers have changed significantly in the last decade. According to a 2020 report by the European Union, the average amount of food waste generated per capita in Europe is around 131 kg per year.  Comparatively, Spain was estimated to have 77kg of food waste per capita, the 18th highest in Europe. However, there is significant variation within Spain, with some regions and cities generating more food waste than others. A 2011 study by the Autonomous University of Barcelona, found that Catalonia is responsible 14.8% of Spain’s total food waste.

Causes 
The main causes of this food waste in Barcelona are overproduction and overconsumption. Restaurants often overproduce food, leading to a surplus of food that goes to waste. For example, set menus at restaurants do not offer choices for the sizes of portions which means consumers may occasionally acquire too much food which goes to waste. In market settings, the majority of food waste is a result of poor management and storage processes. Factors such as inadequate employee training, difficulties in sales forecasting, and duration of fresh products all contribute to food waste in Barcelona's markets.  

Additionally, consumers often buy more food than they need, and end up throwing away food that goes bad before they have a chance to eat it. Researchers have found that there are a wide range of factors contributing to consumers' behavior regarding food waste in Barcelona including: lack of awareness of the volume of food waste, percentage of income invested in food, family structure, and expiration date norms.

Waste Prevention 
In a way to prevent food waste, a goal of waste prevention procedure has to be a priority. Waste prevention relates to actions taken before the product becomes wasted, which reduces the quantity of waste. The waste prevention hierarchy is the order to reduce the amount of waste being contributed. The preventitive measures in order are: Prevention; Reduction at Source; Re-use; Recycle; Energy recovery; Disposal. Inside the recycle section, there is a hierarchy of subsections into source reduction, feed hungry people, feed animals, industrial uses, composting and finally landfill incineration.

Environmental impact 
Food waste has a significant environmental impact, as it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, and other environmental problems. When food is wasted, the resources used to produce, transport, and process it, such as land, water, and energy, are also wasted. This leads to unnecessary environmental impacts, such as:

 Greenhouse gas emissions: When food waste is sent to landfills, it decomposes and releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Methane is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its global warming potential. Additionally, food production, transportation, and processing require energy, and when food is wasted, the energy used to produce it is also wasted. This leads to unnecessary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions generated by food waste in Barcelona has been calculated to be 520,700 tonnes of CO2 emissions, approximately the emissions equivalent to 20,300 cars throughout their useful life.  
 Land use: The production of food requires land, and when food is wasted, the land used to grow it is also wasted. This leads to deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity.
 Water use: Food production also requires water, and when food is wasted, the water used to grow it is also wasted. This can lead to water scarcity and depletion of freshwater resources. 

Reducing food waste can help to mitigate these environmental impacts, as it can conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable food consumption. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as improving food storage and handling practices, promoting sustainable agriculture and production methods, and changing consumer behavior through education and awareness-raising campaigns.

Current initiatives 

The Spanish government has implemented several initiatives to tackle food waste, such as the establishment of the Circular Economy Spanish Strategy which aims to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030. Additionally, the government has passed recent laws such as a law created in June 2022 to promote taking home leftovers and discounting soon-to-expire food stock.  Since 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDs) has been working on goal 12. The goal is to live in a way that helps the environment and doesn't harm it. Including using natural resources wisely and not wasting them. Universities can play an important role in promoting this by teaching students and encouraging healthy habits that support sustainability. This can help create a generation of professionals who are committed to protecting the environment.

In addition to combat food waste in Barcelona, several initiatives have been put in place on a city level. For example, the city's Waste Prevention Plan for Barcelona 2012-2020  strived to reduce the amount of food waste generated by restaurants and supermarkets, promote the donation of surplus food to food banks, and encourage consumers to buy only what they need. Additionally, the city supported initiatives to reduce food waste such as home composting and the prevention of food waste in education center dining rooms.   

There are also several organizations in Barcelona that work to reduce food waste. One example is Rezero, a non-profit organization that aims to create a zero waste society by promoting sustainable consumption and production practices. In addition, some restaurants in Barcelona have taken steps to reduce food waste by offering smaller portion sizes, using leftover ingredients creatively, and composting food waste.

One solution at a smaller scale that has been used in many cities across the globe is the app, Too Good to Go. Too Good To Go is a mobile application that connects consumers with local food businesses that have surplus food at the end of the day, such as restaurants and grocery stores, and offers the surplus food at a discounted price to reduce food waste. The app enables consumers to browse and purchase surplus food from local businesses, reducing food waste while also saving money. The app is available in several countries and has been successful in reducing food waste while also increasing revenue for local businesses. Overall this app aims to benefit both the consumers and businesses, and it has a positive impact on reducing the amount of food waste.

Naomi Wang (born 1992), Chinese singerThe Church of San Salvador, also known as the Church of El Salvador or Collegiate Church of San Salvador, is a church and historic monument in Granada, Spain. The church is located in the historic Albaicín neighbourhood, at Plaza del Salvador (off Cuesta del Chapiz street). It was built in the 16th century on the site of the neighbourhood's former main mosque and incorporates some of its remains.

History 

Prior to the current church, the site was occupied by the Great Mosque of the Albaicin. The mosque was built in the 13th century under Almohad rule. Only its courtyard (sahn), with arcades of horseshoe arches, has been preserved today as part of the church. The mosque originally covered a total area measuring 42.4 by 32.2 metres. Its prayer hall, now disappeared, had a hypostyle form similar to the city's larger Great Mosque on the site of the current Cathedral. It had 9 aisles divided by rows of arches supported by 86 marble columns, with the central aisle being wider than the others. The courtyard was planted with lemon trees. Across the street from the mosque, there originally stood an Islamic primary school and a khan (urban caravanserai).

After the conquest of Granada in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, the building remained a mosque for several years. It was consecrated as a church in 1499 by Cardinal Cisneros, in violation of the city's terms of surrender. It became a parish church in 1501, in the context of the forced conversions that followed the Rebellion of the Alpujarras and the creation of 23 new parishes. In 1527, it was granted the status of a collegiate church by a papal bull of Clement VII, to facilitate the indoctrination of the local Moriscos.

A new church building was constructed in the 16th century to replace the mosque structure. Initially, in the first decades following its consecration, the building was expanded with the addition of new rooms and of a new lateral entrance. The new entrance portal was completed in 1543 by Esteban Sánchez under the direciton of Diego Siloe. In 1565, work began on replacing the old building entirely. First built was the chancel, which was completed in 1592. It was designed by architect Juan de la Maeda, a student of Siloe, and executed by stonemasons Juan Martínez (up to 1576) and Juan de la Vega (after 1576). The church's bell tower was also completed around 1592 and is attributed to architect Ambrosio de Vico. By the end of the century, the rest of the mosque was demolished and work the new nave was carried out around 1610. The northwestern portal, leading to the cloister, also dates from the 17th century. Construction work was slowed considerably by the economic devastation caused by the Morisco rebellion of 1568 and the subsequent expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada, which depleted the neighbourhood's population (which was largely composed of Moriscos until then). This also caused the building itself to be completed with a less ambitious architectural design than initially envisioned.

The church underwent multiple vicissitudes in the following centuries. After the damage caused by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the church's college of canons had to move to different churches, until eventually they were officially moved to the Church of San Pablo in 1771. At this point, San Salvador ceased to be a collegiate church and resumed its original role as an important parish church.

The church was almost completely destroyed by a fire in 1936, in the context of anti-clerical riots. In addition to the structural damage, many of its artworks and furnishings were lost. Reconstruction began in 1937 under the direction of architect Fernando Wilhelmi and continued in multiple phases afterward. The courtyard, which mostly still dates to the former mosque, was reconstructed in the 1950s. Th last major restoration was carried on the front of the church in 1996.

Architecture 

The architectural style of the church is a mix of the traditional Mudéjar style of Granada and the new classicizing Renaissance style associated with the contemporary El Escorial. The original architectural ambition for the church was most likely compromised by the crises that beset Granada during the time of its construction.

The entire building occupies a rectangular space measuring about  wide by  long. The church has a single nave, preceded to the northwest by a courtyard (originally the courtyard of the mosque) and leading to the chancel and altar at the southeast end. The courtyard measures  and is lined on three sides by arcades of horseshoe arches. The main nave building measures around . The chancel is demarcated from the rest of the nave by a large arch. Two chapels open onto its sides and two other closed chapels are located in the back. A series of other rooms, intended for the college of canons, stretch along the northeastern side of the building, near the main entrance portal.
The vaulted ceiling of the nave, originally a traditional wood-frame construction (known as armadura), was replaced by cement vaults after the 1936 fire. The chancel was most likely intended to be covered by a stone vault during the original construction, but due to the fiscal shortfalls it was replaced by a simpler octagonal wooden ceiling instead. The current ceiling here is a cement imitation of the original, also made after 1936.

The main entrance portal on the northeast side, still dates from 1543. It reflects the ornate Granadan Plateresque style of Diego Siloe, as well as the greater architectural rigour of construction prior to the city's economic crisis later that century. It was restored in 1996. The niche above the door contains a stone replica of what was previously a wooden sculpture of the Virgin and Child.
The hiding power is an ability of a paint to hide the surface that the paint was applied to. Numerically, it is defined as an area of surface coated by a volume of paint (spreading rate) at which the "complete hiding" of the underlying surface occurs.

Causes 
Whenever light is shone onto a paint-coated surface, it is partially reflected and absorbed by the coating. Once the light reaches the underlying surface (substrate), it is again reflected and absorbed by the substrate, the process happens once more as the reflected light travels back through the paint layer. Depending on the paint properties, the information about the substrate might be visible (or not) in the light that emerges back from the coating. Hiding power is the property of the paint material that inhibits this visibility, manifesting in the opacity of a layer of paint. The term hiding is generic and applied to designate either hiding power or opacity.

If the coating of paint is highly absorptive, the color of the coating will be dark and the hiding will be provided by the absorption. If the coating is highly reflective, the color of the surface will be light in color, but still will hide the substrate well, with the hiding being the result of light scattering. If the paint layer exhibits low absorption and scattering, light will travel through the layer and reveal the substrate (low opacity or poor hiding).

Measurements 
The hiding power is measured by applying the coating to the black-and-white (occasionally gray-and-white) panels and using either the photometric or visual observation. Since the eye cannot make the quantitative assessments, yet is very sensitive to the presence of contrast, the measurements are made by varying the paint film thickness, determined by the amount of area that is coated by a certain amount of paint (so called spreading rate, typically measured in square meters per liter).

For the photometry the black and white substrates are calibrated to have, respectively, 1% and 80% reflectivity. The result, a contrast ratio, is expressed as a ratio of the intensity of light reflected from the darker area to the one from the lighter area (technically, the CIE Y or "luminance" is measured). The same substrates are used for the visual measurements.

The hiding power is numerically defined as a spreading rate at which the contrast between the different areas of substrate becomes impossible to see or measure (complete hiding). In practice, an approximated end-point is used instead, for the photometric contrast ratio it is 98%.

Kubelka–Munk method 

The Kubelka–Munk theory was developed in the 1930s and is still widely used in the 21st century. This simplified version of the radiative transfer theory reduces the paint properties to just two coefficients, one for scattering and one for absorption. Once these coefficients are known, the hiding power can be calculated. The longevity of the method is due to the ease of calculating these constants using the optical reflectometry (measurement of just one application of paint with incomplete hide on a black-and-white drawdown chart for each light wavelength is required). The model uses many assumptions, including the diffuse illumination, no reflections on the film/air and film/substrate interfaces, reasonable thickness of the paint layer.

Direct measurements 
Historically, the measurements were made directly using devices such as the Pfund cryptometer (introduced in 1930, earlier "all-black" model is from 1919) that places wet paint into a wedge-like arrangement of plates over the black-and-white background; the wedge is moved over the boundary until the boundary line becomes invisible.

The direct measurements are still in demand where the real-world constraints of an uneven paint application are present, for example, the painting of buildings inevitably involves unevenness of the paint thickness due to the texture of a brush or a roller. The resulting perceived opacity is sometimes called an applied hiding power. ASTM D5150 standard calls for a use of a special panel with stripes of different shades of gray, each stripe has its own "rating". The paint is applied across the stripes, the largest rating of the completely hidden stripes is the hiding power for the paint. Paint producers use variations of this method.

Role of pigments 
Almost all the hiding power of the paint is due to the pigment (binders are typically clear). In general, the hiding power of a pigment is closely related to scattering of light by its particles while suspended in the binder. The scattering on the interface between two substances is higher when there is a larger difference between their refractive indices. The refractive index of a binder is low, about 1.5, so the hiding power of a pigment usually increases with higher values of its refractive index.

White 
White pigments absorb the light poorly. However, if dispersed in a binder some of them, with low refractive indices (about 1.5), while appearing white in the air (with a refractive index of 1.0), exhibit almost no scattering in the paint and thus no hiding power - these are so called "extenders". The white pigments with higher refractive indices deliver opacity and thus are classified as hiding pigments.
